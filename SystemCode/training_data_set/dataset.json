Before Singapore became a hotspot for celebrity chef openings, there was Les Amis. The locally and internationally lauded French fine dining establishment reinvents themselves every once in a while.\nWhy go? It's a fine-dining stalwart in Singapore.\nDon't miss: Splurge on classic French fare at the newly crowned three-starred Les Amis.\nWhat is it? Sweden\u2019s first three-Michelin-starred restaurant is\u00a0Chef Bj\u00f6rn Frantz\u00e9n first international outpost.\nWhy go? It looks like a dreamy Swedish home with porcelain mushrooms, kitchen paraphernalia and food sketches lining its walls alongside cosy couches and wing chairs looking into an open kitchen.\nDon't miss: Explore contemporary Nordic cuisine at freshly minted two-starred Z\u00e9n.\nWhat is it? The world\u2019s only Michelin-starred Peranakan restaurant.\nWhy go? Chef-owner Malcolm Lee\u00a0tells the story of Peranakan heritage through the dishes served and the experience created, redefining classic Peranakan dishes into an inspired and elevated form.\nDon't miss: Dining here is a communal affair. Opt for Lee\u2019s signature \u2018ahmakase\u2019 menu.\nTanjong Pagar\nWhat is it? Cloudstreet by chef Rishi Naleendra is the hottest new restaurant opening this year.\nWhy go? Tasting menus are priced from $68 during lunch and $168 for dinner and showcase progressive dishes that take inspiration from Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka and other parts of the world.\nDon't miss: Cloudstreet should be seeing stars next year, so get a reservation now while you can.\nRaffles Place\nWhat is it? Whether you\u2019re on a hunt on the city\u2019s best street art or hungry for an assortment of noodle dishes, look no further than the two-storied Amoy Street Food Centre.\nWhy go? It is decked with wall art that reflects its heritage, as well as a smorgasbord of hawker choices, from spicy Thai dishes and hearty congee to delicious pasta and traditional nasi padang.\nDon't miss: Tear into deep-fried ayam penyet and other modernised dishes from Rayyan's Waroeng Penyet.\nRochor\nWhat is it? Not just a Punjabi restaurant, Jaggi\u2019s also\u00a0offers North Indian and neighbouring cuisines\u00a0for you to savour a plethora of flavours.\nWhy go? Go to Jaggi\u2019s Northern Indian Cuisine for a warm, spicy meal.\nDon't miss: Try favourites like the keema and tandoori chicken.\nWhat is it? A\u00a0contemporary Indian restaurant with creative yet satisfyingly delicious plates inspired by chef-owner Murugan Thevar's travels around South Asia, his Penang heritage and his time working in Singapore.\nWhy go? Hit up Thevar for Indian dishes with a modern twist.\nDon't miss: The star of the show is the pork ribs glazed with medjool\u00a0dates ($35) best served with a plate of berry pulao ($12).\nBukit Batok\nWhat is it? Think of this as Singapore\u2019s savviest zi char restaurant. Despite its rural Pulau Ubin beginnings in 1986, this wok shop\u2019s kept up with the times.\nWhy go? Head to New Ubin Seafood for chilli crab and other updated zi char sharing plates.\nDon't miss: Unlikely bestsellers include the US Black Angus ribeye ($14/100g) and Carabinero prawn sashimi ($18/prawn).\nGeylang\nWhat is it? The stall is popular for its gula Melaka-filled steamed rice flour cakes topped with grated coconut.\nWhy go? Try the Netflix Street Food-approved sweet treats.\nDon't miss: As the pillowy rice cake itself crumbles gently in our mouths, the richness of the viscous gula Melaka within comes to the forefront. Best eaten piping hot.\nChinatown\nWhat is it? Smith Street Taps offers\u00a0craft beer\u00a0in a casual way with its pop-up kopitiam space in Chinatown Complex.\nWhy go? The bare-bones stall can dispense up to five fresh brews at any given time.\nDon't miss: While creatures of habit will find comfort in the more commercial offerings like Sapporo and wheaty Weihenstephaner on tap, the thirsty craft beer fan will appreciate the roster of rarer, more experimental pours with the likes of Brewdog\u2019s MashTag and Libertine Black.\nRestaurants, Singaporean\nWhat is it? One of Singapore's best-kept secrets for prata.\nWhy go? The prata kosongs here are super crispy on the outside and much fluffier on the inside.\nDon't miss: This small stall is only open on weekdays and even so, tends to run out pretty early so it might take you a few tries before you finally get to try it.\nToa Payoh\nWhat is it? A laksa joint\u00a0that's popular with the heartland working crowd.\nWhy go? The bright orange laksa broth comes topped with slices of fried fishcake, tofu puffs, prawns, blood cockles and a generous dash of Vietnamese coriander. But what makes it stand out from other places that hawk this iconic local dish is the chilli.\nDon't miss: Get up early and join the queue at Lik Ming Laksa for a sinfully decadent breakfast ($3).\nMarine Parade\nWhat is it? Located in the basement of Katong Shopping Centre, this humble chicken rice stall has been around for a long time. Yet, it still warrants long snaking queues and long waiting times just to get a tasty set of chicken, rice, achar, soup and vegetables (if you wish to add on).\nWhy go? The main draw here is the chicken \u2013 poached and then soaked in cold water, it creates a delicious jelly-like layer underneath the skin which soaks up the soy sauce nicely.\nDon't miss: Did we mention the free-flow soup that comes with the\u00a0tender chicken and aromatic rice?\nChinatown\nWhat is it? There are over 30 different varieties of mooncakes available, ranging from the typical Cantonese bakes to those that follow traditional Teochew recipes.\nWhy go? The signature is the da lao bing,\u00a0a\u00a0Teochew-style flaky pastry is filled with green or red bean paste. There are also the white sesame mooncakes as well as other bakes like the la gao (black glutinous rice cake) that are getting increasingly difficult to find.\nDon't miss: Sample tau sar piah and other time-honoured\nbakes from Poh Guan Cake House.\nRochor\nWhat is it? The new kid on the block, Mother Dough is a force to be reckoned with when we're talking about the best croissants in Singapore.\nWhy go? Bite into its flaky croissants and freshly baked\nsourdough loaves.\nDon't miss: Besides the crowd favourite and fast-selling almond croissants ($4.20), take some time to give their other freshly baked goods a try. From the chocolate pound cake ($4/slice) to a simple baguette, everything here is baked to perfection.\nBedok\nWhat is it? If we had to choose one national dish for Singapore that you have to try while you're here, it has to be our chilli crab.\u00a0It\u2019s sweet, savoury, tangy and spicy all in one bite and is best mopped up with deep-fried mantou (bun).\nWhy go? Jumbo Seafood is one of the best places to get elbow-deep into a plate of chilli crab. Not only do you get to enjoy the sea breeze, but the seafood is absolutely stellar as well.\nDon't miss: The chilli crab, of course. But if you're up for something even spicier, the black pepper crabs are as much of a local favourite. Not a fan of spice? Crabs tossed in creamy salted egg yolk sauce is another uniquely Singaporean offering that's equally delicious.\nGeylang\nWhat is it? Try the king of fruits renown for its pungent smell and creamy flesh in the middle of Singapore's infamous red-light district.\nWhy go? No trip to Singapore is complete without conquering the king. It's a great tale to tell back home and who knows, you actually might like it.\nDon\u2019t miss: Try the best of the best, the coveted Mao Shan Wang durian. Prized for its soft flesh and bittersweet taste, this durian doesn't come cheap but is definitely worth the extra coin.\nChinatown\nWhat is it? The cheapest Michelin-starred meal you can get in the world \u2013 just be prepared to queue for at least two hours.\nWhy go? Michelin and local-approved food for less than $5. Chinatown Complex is also home to plenty of other superstar local dishes and even a craft beer shop where you can get your ales on draft.\nDon\u2019t miss: The star of the show\u00a0is the soya sauce chicken ($7-$14). And don't be afraid to pile on juicy and moreish char siew, too. The stall also serves up roasted pork rice ($2.50), pork ribs rice ($3) and dumpling noodles ($3). Vegetable dishes include bean sprouts ($3-$4) and leafy greens cooked in oyster sauce ($4-$5).\nLim Chu Kang\nWhat is it? An organic countryside farm way out in Kranji that's the brainchild of Ivy Singh, the straight-talking former president of Netball Singapore.\nWhy go? Learn more about local produce by going on a tour of the farm and find out more about the history of food at the Bollywood Food Museum. Kranji Countryside is also home to other local farms such as Jurong Frog Farm and Hay Dairies so feel free to spend the day on a farm-hopping expedition.\nDon't miss: Tuck into organic vegetables grown on-site at Poison Ivy Bistro. Don't be shocked by the colour of the nasi lemak here \u2013 it's naturally died with butterfly blue pea flower that they grow onsite.\nCity Hall\nWhat is it? Now that you're acquainted with the local produce you can find on the island, try them in a Michelin-starred meal at Labyrinth. The modern Singaporean restaurant is housed in the Esplanade and whips up creations like quail satay and soy beancurd with bird's nest.\nWhy go? Chef Han Li Guang elevates local food to a whole new level and champions what Singapore is all about in his cooking. Creative, playful and packed with flavour \u2013 the food at Labyrinth top class.\nDon't miss: The Labyrinth rojak. A part of Labyrinth's tasting menu, this Singaporean staple gets an upgrade with herbs from Edible Garden City, cempedak sorbet and a natural stingless bee honey that has a natural tang that mimics the taste of assam.\nGeylang\nWhat is it? A traditional Peranakan restaurant that's been doling out local classics like\u00a0ayam buah keluak and itek tim\u00a0for years. It's a favourite among families and it's not uncommon to see three to four generations sitting together at a table here.\nWhy go? You've come to the right place for\u00a0an authentic taste of Peranakan food. For those unfamiliar with Peranakan culture, a trip to Katong is the perfect place to start. From the colourful shophouses rich in heritage that line the street to the array of Peranakan restaurants that call the area home, Katong provides a feast for all your senses.\nDon't miss: They do all the classics right here. We're talking beef rendang, ayam buah\u00a0keluak, sambal goreng, chap chye and more.\nYishun\nWhat is it? A popular supper haunt when the rest of the stalls have shuttered for the night. It's open till midnight and is the place where hungry night owls congregate after a night of drinking and partying.\nWhy go? For sinful plates of roti prata, of course. There's also plenty of other Indian and Malay options on the menu too.\nDon't miss: A slice of plain prata costs a mere $1.20 but go crazy and customise it to your heart's desire. Get one with egg, onion and cheese ($4) or egg, onion and mushrooms ($3.60).\nWhat is it? An old-school breakfast institution that's been serving the quintessential Singaporean breakfast of kopi, kaya toast and soft-boiled eggs since 1939.\nWhy go? For a taste of nostalgia that you won't find at chains like Killiney Kopitiam or Toast Box.\nDon't miss: A\u00a0robust cup of kopi\u00a0pulled the traditional way through a sock, crisp and fluffy kaya butter bread and perfectly cooked soft-boiled eggs best topped with a dash of pepper and soy sauce.\nChinatown\nWhat is it? One of the few dim sum spots in town with the authentic pushcart experience and, to match, decor plucked straight out of the \u201960s. Little old ladies flock to your table, hawking baskets filled with liu sha bao ($4.70) and xiao long bao ($4.50) and your card to track your orders. Ordering way too much is part of the experience here, so check your self-control at the door.\nWhy go? The dumplings at Red Star aren't the best in town \u2013 there are Chinese restaurants in hotels for that \u2013 but the experience of pushing through other hungry diners to snap up piping hot morsels of dim sum can't be beat.\nDon't miss: Reliable favourites include char siew sou ($4.50) and oversized har gao ($4.50) stuffed with whole shrimp.\nTiong Bahru\nWhat is it? Ask any Singaporean what's the one thing you have to do while you're in town and the answer is most likely going to be \"eat at a hawker centre\". These food courts are an integral part of Singapore\u2019s food landscape so treat yourself to an education of the finest degree at Tiong Bahru Market.\nWhy go? The recently revamped centre houses more than 80 hawker stalls including legends such as Tiong Bahru Fried Kway Teow and Jian Bo Shui Kueh. Plus it's bright and airy so you won't have to sweat it out as much.\nDon't miss:\nTanjong Pagar\nWhat is it? With a focus on all things regional \u2013 everything from its spirits, music and furniture is sourced from around these parts \u2013 Native pushes the boundaries of what an Asian bar should and can be.\nWhy go? The cocktails are as delicious as they are inventive. There's a sour and spicy kimchi and strawberry cocktail, a Peranakan-inspired tipple made with local goat's milk as well as a showcase of Singaporean spirits and mead.\nDon't miss: The pineapple arrack ($23). The only cocktail that's been on Native's menu since day one. It's one that both whisky and rum lovers will enjoy but it's different enough to make you do a double take.\nChinatown\nWhat is it? With the #eatclean movement hitting Singapore as hard as its presence has been felt worldwide, this vegan deli-retailer-bar\u00a0is one of the pioneers of raw food here.\nWhy go? Afterglow works with local and regional farmers to procure the crops for its inventive fare like a dragon fruit, pomegranate, avocado salad bowl with chunky chopped macadamia and mint dressing ($16), and a raw taco bowl topped with salsa, walnut \u2018meat\u2019 and cashew cream ($16). The restaurant's also noted for making its own vegan cheese ($16) with cashew nuts.\u00a0Adding to the buzz of the area at night, a selection of small-batch wines, craft beer and whiskeys is also served to accompany the healthy cuisine.\nDon't miss: The zucchini linguine with walnut meatballs ($20). Raw spiralise\u00a0zucchini is topped with tangy tomato sauce and \"meat\"balls\u00a0made from walnuts, shiitake and dates for an added crunch.\nKallang\nWhat is it? Local coffee roasters Papa Palheta helped pioneer the third-wave coffee scene in Singapore, particularly with the opening of their uber-popular caf\u00e9-retail complex, Chye Seng Huat Hardware (becoming one of the first joints to plant a flag in the hipster 'hood of Jalan Besar).\nWhy go? Its house blends are roasted directly in the complex from single origin beans; there's also a retail wall with grinders and brew contraptions to release flavour from the beans.\nDon't miss: While their hot coffees are great, there's something about Singapore's balmy climes that make cold brews all the more satisfying. There's the black ($7) made with Ethiopia suke quto\u00a0beans, white ($7.50) brewed with a throwback blend and the nitro ($7),\u00a0a malty black coffee infused with nitrogen.\nRochor\nWhat is it? Zam Zam \u2013 its name refers to \u2018holy water\u2019 in Arabic \u2013 has been an institution in the Kampong Glam neighbourhood since the Kerala-born Abdul Kadir opened the restaurant there in 1908. The\u00a0recipes have largely remained unchanged, and unhealthy, too.\nWhy go? There\u2019s no preventing the pong of oil and fried dough clinging to your clothes the moment you step into this grungy shophouse unit. But it\u2019s well worth the smell. Zam Zam has been serving up its briyani (from $6) and murtabak (from $5) for well over a century, so you can be pretty much assured of getting the legit stuff.\nDon't miss: Forget about\u00a0your diet and go for the mutton murtabak with a side of fish curry. It\u2019s crispy on the edges and has more folds than an origami crane, within which you\u2019ll find layers of onions, eggs and meat. If it\u2019s briyani you\u2019re after, Zam Zam makes its version Hyderabadi dum style: the meat is cooked together with the orange-flecked basmati, which makes the rice that much more fragrant.\nFry your own snacks at Hum Jin Pang\nWhat is it? DIY is part of the fun at Hum Jin Pang in Maxwell Food Centre. Customers at this hawker stall are required to fry their own hum jin pang (fried sweet-savoury pancakes). Join the queue, take note what the person in front of you does, and be sure to turn the pancake over quickly \u2013\u00a0the oil is hot and everything cooks really quickly.\nWhy go? Where else are you going to get the experience of making your own local snack fried to your desired crispiness all for the low, low price of $1 for six pieces.\nDon't miss: There are only two options available \u2013 the fritters either come stuffed with sweet red bean paste or five spice so pick your preferred snack or just get both.\nAdvertising\n31\nOrchard\nWhat is it? The third on the World's 50 Best Bars 2018 and number one on Asia's 50 Best Bars for two years in a row, Manhattan Bar at Regent Singapore is a portal to New York City where ladies are decorated in pearls and gentlemen dressed to the nines.\nWhy go? The bar team is extremely friendly \u2013 and generous \u2013 there's a huge variety of cocktails on the menu so there's definitely something for everyone.\u00a0The menu takes you through the ages of NYC,\u00a0from the 1520s to the 1970s and recreates iconic drinks of the era. It also houses a large collection of American whiskeys if you're a bourbon connoisseur.\nDon't miss: The classic Manhattan ($25). Made with Michter\u2019s US1 Straight Rye, house cherry brandy, Mancino Rosso vermouth and angostura bitters, this cocktail is the bar's signature for a reason.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Do Not Sell My Personal Information\nEdition\nMar 10, 2020\n15 Rules To Live By If You Want To Eat And Drink For Cheap While Traveling\nLet the free food hoarding begin.\nTravelers should take extra precaution due to the current global outbreak of the coronavirus. Refer to government travel advisories before proceeding with travel plans, take routine hygiene precautions, and read the fine print on policies before booking travel for the future. See more information about traveling during the coronavirus outbreak and check out our latest coverage .\nYou know what's great about traveling? Getting to try incredible food and drinks from all around the world . You know what's not so great? Having to pay for it all.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nComedy Central\nUnless you have an endless budget or are traveling somewhere with a low cost of living , you\u2019ve got to reign it in. And these tips will help you do just that. Because no one should have to say no to a taste of sea urchin in Japan or a bottle of Champagne in France \u2014 but if you return home to a terrifying credit card bill, chances are your next trip will be put on hold.\nHere are some tried and true rules for eating and drinking for cheap \u2014 without having to sacrifice all the glorious foods you need to try while traveling.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nNBC\nIn other words: you can have your cake and eat it too.\n1. Pack your own airport food.\n2. Stick to the \"one meal out per day\" rule.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nDisney\nFood is a big part of travel, and to skip eating out entirely is just sad. But if you\u2019re dining out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you might end up blowing your budget. Eating just one big meal out a day will help keep your wallet fat without depriving your taste buds.\n3. And when you can, eat out for lunch instead of dinner.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nCrackle / Netflix\nIn many places you can find better priced (and often larger) meals at midday than you can in the evening. Because of this, eating your big meal out at lunch might save you a couple bucks and will provide a nice midday break between morning and afternoon tourist stops.\n4. Rather than buying drinks at bars or restaurants, pre-game like a college freshman.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTV Land\nIn many places \u2014 the US included \u2014 you can buy an entree for the cost of a cocktail. Take a cue from the college kids and mix up a simple drink or sip a beer before you head out. You\u2019ll have just as much fun, and won\u2019t have to pony up for a watered-down $10 vodka soda or a $15 glass of wine.\n5. Then, when you get the dessert menu...bail.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\n20th Century Fox\nI\u2019m not saying you should deprive yourself of something sweet; just ignore the $9 mousse, pay the check, and walk to the nearest convenience store where you can buy a bar of chocolate for $1.\n6. Stock up on breakfast fixings at the grocery store.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nNetflix\nBreakfast is an easy meal to go light on. Most people don\u2019t need a full cooked meal, and when you\u2019re traveling, chances are you\u2019re eager to get out and explore anyway. Buy a bag of apples, some yogurt, and granola, and fuel up (for less).\n7. Opt for street food over sit-down restaurants.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\n20th Century Fox\nThe moment you sit down at a table the prices go up, and depending on what country you're in, you may have to tip. Why mess with fancy restaurants when you can find delicious \u2014 and often more authentic \u2014 food at a street vendor or counter-service spot? Grab and go is almost always cheaper, and there\u2019s something oddly romantic about scarfing a falafel sandwich on a curb while shooing away pigeons.\n8. Get off the tourist circuit, then look for bars and restaurants with happy hours \u2014 or free bar snacks.\n10. If you're staying somewhere with a kitchen, cook in.\nWhen you\u2019re trying to save money on food, it pays to book an Airbnb or a hostel with a kitchen. A box of spaghetti and a jar of pasta sauce will only cost a few bucks and takes no time to prepare.\n11. Keep your eye out \u2014 or actively scout \u2014 events with free food and booze.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nParamount Pictures / Via Giphy / giphy.com\nAn event with free food and drink isn't just something you find on college campuses. No matter where you go in the world, there will be gallery openings, public events, and neighborhood street parties with free food and drinks. The trick is not being afraid to dive in when you see an opportunity.\n12. When you head out for the day, pack your own snacks.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nNBC\nYou may feel like a middle-aged, over-prepared mom, but packing snacks can be a huge money saver when you\u2019re traveling. God forbid hanger strikes and you have to grab something inside an art museum or movie theater, where the cost of convenience is sky high. Take a cue from the pros and bust out a baggie of pretzels, an apple, or some dried fruit. You\u2019ll feel like a modern-day hero.\n13. And when you find freebies, stock up.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\nComedy Central\nYou may not be hungry in the moment, but consider your dwindling budget and stock up. Tuck away an extra banana or a muffin for later \u2014 you won't regret it.\n14. Bring a reusable bottle so you don't have to waste money (and plastic) buying bottled water.\n15. Link up with family, friends, and friends of friends.\nTap to play or pause GIF\nTap to play or pause GIF\n20th Century Fox\nSometimes the best part about traveling is getting away from family and friends \u2014 but when you\u2019re broke and hungry, you\u2019ll get over it. When you make time to meet up with a distant aunt for lunch or the friend of your college roommate for drinks, not only will you have a great catch up, but they might even offer to pay \u2014 you did travel all this way, after all. Better yet, they may offer up a free place to stay.\nMore on this\nJay Fleckenstein / BuzzFeed\nShare This Article\n"

            "Singapore is a gourmet's paradise, with everything from humble street stalls to 5-star restaurants. There are over 30 different cooking styles, including various regional styles of Chinese cuisine, American, English, French, Indian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Russian and Swiss.\nThe most common, though are Malay, Indian and Chinese cuisines. Malay food is famed for its use of spices and coconut milk; no pork is used, as most Malays are Muslim. The Indian community mostly traces its roots back to South India and their food reflects this, meaning that spicy vegetarian dishes are predominant. To try many small dishes, order a thali (which may be served on a banana leaf). The most popular Chinese regional cuisine is Cantonese, which includes a lot of stir fry dishes as well as dim sum (small dishes, often steamed, which are intended for sharing at lunchtime).\nSpecialities\n\u2022 Beef rendang (coconut milk beef curry).\n\u2022 Char kway teow (thick rice noodles stir fried in soy sauce and chilli with prawns and clams, often with additional ingredients such as egg).\n\u2022 Chilli crab (fresh crab with a piquant tomato sauce).\n\u2022 Gado gado (a fruit and vegetable salad in peanut sauce).\n\u2022 Hainanese chicken rice (steamed chicken served with rice which has been cooked in chicken stock, along with ginger and chilli dips).\n\u2022 Ikan assam (fish in a sour tamarind sauce).\n\u2022 Laksa (a coconut-based spicy noodle soup, usually containing prawns or chicken as well as tofu, fishcake and beansprouts).\n\u2022 Masala dosa (a rolled pancake filled with a vegetarian curry, popular as a snack or for breakfast).\n\u2022 Satay (skewers of marinated meat cooked over charcoal, served with spicy peanut sauce, cucumber, onion, rice and coconut).\nThings to know\nAlthough the Singaporean authorities have closed most of the individual food stalls which were once common, street food is still very much in evidence in dining areas known as hawker centres. These are often open-air, and always contain an array of stalls specialising in different dishes. Other eating options include kopitiam (literally coffee shops, although they also sell food). There are also food courts in malls, often with excellent food, as well as restaurants with waiter service. Bars/cocktail lounges often have table and counter service. There are no licensing hours.\nTipping\nOfficially discouraged in restaurants, hotels and the airport. A 10% service charge is included in restaurant bills.\nDrinking age\n\u2022 Bandung (milk mixed with rose syrup).\n\u2022\tBubble tea (sweet, milky tea with tapioca balls which can be sucked up through the extra-wide straw).\n\u2022\tKopi (coffee, served with condensed milk by default but available in a variety of forms including Kopi-O which is black with sugar).\n\u2022\tSarsi (root beer, which usually comes in cans; ice cream can be added to make a float).\n\u2022\tSingapore Sling (cocktail containing gin, cherry liquor, Cointreau, benedictine, pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine and Angostura bitters). It was invented in the early 20th century for the Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\n\u2022\tSoya bean milk.\n\u2022 Sugar cane juice.\n\u2022 Teh tarik (tea which has been poured repeatedly from one cup to another, cooling it, mixing in the condensed milk used as a sweetener, and leaving it with a frothy top).\n\u2022 Tiger Beer (ubiquitous local lager brand, although recent years have seen the opening of a handful of microbreweries producing more interesting beers).\nBrowse our Video Guides\nAbout The World Travel Guide\nThe World Travel Guide (WTG) is the flagship digital consumer brand within the Columbus Travel Media portfolio.

            "We use cookies to give you the best online shopping experience. You can find out more by reading our Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions .\nOK\nOver the past few decades, Japan has made significant contributions to the culture of the UK and other Western countries.\nAs well as revolutionising our cars, computers, and cartoon characters; Japan has also broadened our culinary knowledge with the introduction of its delicious and highly unique cuisine. We at Japan Centre live and breathe Japanese cuisine, so we compiled a list of our top 30 recommendations for Japanese foods that everybody needs to try.\n1. Sushi\nSushi is one of the first foods that spring to mind when we think about Japanese cuisine. This delicacy was one of the first Japanese dishes to be exported to the US after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, and since then its popularity has steadily increased year after year. The word \u2018sushi\u2019 refers to any dish made with Japanese rice that has been seasoned with rice vinegar. Common varieties of sushi include makizushi (sushi rice and fillings rolled up in nori seaweed), nigiri sushi (shaped, bite-size mounds of sushi rice with single slices of raw fish or similar draped over the top) and inarizushi (sushi rice stuffed inside pockets of inari ; a type of seasoned, fried tofu).\n2. Udon\nOne of the three main noodle varieties eaten in Japan; udon noodles are thick, chewy, and traditionally made from wheat flour and brine water. Udon can be served in a number of different ways (mixed into stir fries, added to hot pots, served cold with a tsuyu or tentsuyu soup base on the side for dipping), but are most commonly used in noodle soups, where they are served in a savoury soup broth with different garnishes. Some of the most common udon noodle soup dishes include kitsune udon (\u2018fox udon\u2019, topped with aburaage fried tofu), tempura udon (topped with tempura battered seafood and vegetables), and chikara udon (\u2018power udon\u2019, topped with grilled mochi rice cakes).\n3. Tofu\nAlthough tofu is mainly thought of in Western countries as a health food or vegetarian alternative, in Southeast Asian countries like Japan, tofu (particularly silken tofu) is enjoyed by everybody and is a common part of the traditional diet. To answer the question 'what is tofu?', it is soy milk that has been coagulated, with the resulting curds being pressed into blocks. These blocks come in differing levels of firmness, and can be eaten uncooked (perhaps with a couple of savoury garnishes), boiled in hot pots, or fried into tasty pieces of aburaage and used as a garnish.\n4. Tempura\nIf you enjoy crispy fried foods, then you will love tempura. Tempura are pieces or slices of meat, fish, and/or vegetables that have been covered in a special tempura batter and deep fried until they become crunchy and pale gold in colour. Unlike in the UK, where battered foods tend to be made from meats and fish, tempura tends to be made from either small shellfish like prawns, or vegetables like green beans, pumpkin, daikon mooli radish, and sweet potato. Tempura can be eaten by itself (perhaps with a little grated daikon and a small dish of tsuyu for dipping), or served on top of rice bowls or noodle soups.\n5. Yakitori\nWhile\r\nwe in the UK might pick up a serving of chips or a hot dog during a sports match,\r\nthe Japanese will pick up some yakitori . With a name literally meaning\r\n\u2018barbecued chicken\u2019, yakitori are small skewers of bite-size chicken\r\npieces seasoned with salt or brushed with a sauce, or tare, of mirin rice wine, soy sauce, sake alcohol,\r\nand sugar. There are many different types of yakitori, but the most common\r\nvarieties are momo (chicken thigh), negima (chicken and spring onion), and tsukune (chicken meatballs).\n6. Sashimi\nPossibly one of the most controversial dishes in all of Japanese cuisine, sashimi is raw fish or meat that has been expertly cut into thin slices and typically comes served with daikon radish, pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce. Sashimi differs from sushi in that all sushi is made with vinegared rice and does not always contain raw fish, while sashimi is almost exclusively raw fish and is never served with rice. The fish used to make sashimi must be as fresh as possible, both in order to minimise the risk of contamination, and because fresher fish makes for tastier sashimi.\n7. Ramen\nRamen is a noodle soup dish consisting of wheat noodles (also known as 'ramen noodles'), a savoury broth (soy sauce, salt, miso, and tonkotsu pork bone are the four main ramen broth bases) and toppings of meat, protein, and/or vegetables such as sliced pork, nori seaweed, spring onions, bamboo shoots, and others. Ramen is one of present-day Japan\u2019s absolute favourite delicacies, costing very little and being widely available in restaurants and ramen bars (which are on almost every street corner). Indeed, Japanese ramen is so popular that there is a ramen-themed museum/amusement park in Tokyo.\n8. Donburi\nThis rice bowl dish is almost as popular as ramen in Japan and a common lunchtime choice among busy Japanese workers. Donburi is made by preparing (normally by simmering or frying) various meat, fish and vegetables and serving over steamed rice in large bowls (also called 'donburi'). While donburi can be made using just about any assortment of ingredients, the most common types include oyakodon (simmered chicken, egg, and green onion), gyudon (sliced beef and onion simmered in a soy sauce soup base), tendon (fried tempura pieces drizzled in tsuyu), and katsudon (breaded and deep-fried pork cutlets, or tonkatsu, simmered in tsuyu with onion and egg).\n9. Natto\nIn the same way that Marmite divides the British nation, so too does natto divide the Japanese. This traditional Japanese food is made by fermenting soy beans in a special type of bacteria that is naturally produced in the human gastrointestinal tract. Natto has a strong smell similar to mouldy cheese, as well as a sticky/slimy texture that many find off-putting. However, many other people love these fermented soy beans for their full-bodied salty and savoury (or umami) flavour and their ample nutritional value. Is natto delicious or disgusting? It is up to you to decide.\n10. Oden\nNo cold Japanese winter would be complete without oden. This winter hot pot dish, or nabemono , is made by taking an assortment of vegetables and proteins (including processed fish cakes, mochi rice cakes, boiled eggs, daikon radish, konjac yam and tofu), and stewing them in a light broth seasoned with soy sauce and dashi (a soup stock made from infusions of bonito fish flakes, kombu kelp seaweed, and/or other savoury ingredients) in a large hot pot at the centre of a table. Diners can then scoop out their favourite pieces and enjoy with karashi mustard and other condiments. As well as being a hearty main meal, the simmering hot pot also serves as a communal heater on cold evenings.\n11. Tamagoyaki\nA versatile delicacy that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, tamagoyaki (which literally means \u2018cooked egg\u2019) is a Japanese omelette made by sequentially cooking and rolling up several layers of beaten egg (sometimes seasoned with soy sauce and/or sugar). A freshly cooked tamagoyaki looks like a rolled up cr\u00eape, which can then be sliced up and eaten by itself (often this is how it is eaten at breakfast) or used a topping or filling in sushi. A tamagoyaki-topped nigiri sushi is often eaten in sushi bars as the final course, as the tamagoyaki has a slight sweetness that makes it almost dessert-like.\n12. Soba\nOtherwise known as \u2018buckwheat noodles\u2019 (\u2018soba\u2019 is the Japanese word for \u2018buckwheat\u2019), soba are one of the three main varieties of noodle most frequently eaten in Japan. Unlike udon and ramen; soba noodles are made partially, if not entirely, from buckwheat flour. This gives them a distinctly earthy and slightly nutty flavour that works well with stronger flavours like garlic and sesame. Soba can be served hot in soups with toppings of spring onions, agetama tempura flakes, kamaboko fish cakes and/or grilled mochi), or cold with a side of tsuyu and\u00a0garnishes of green onions, shredded nori seaweed, and wasabi.\n13. Tonkatsu\nTonkatsu pork cutlets are one of the many yoshoku, or \u2018western-style\u2019 foods, that were originally introduced to Japan by Europeans. Like most other yoshoku foods, the Japanese took the original tonkatsu and made it their own. Today, tonkatsu is made by coating pork chops in crisp panko breadcrumbs and deep-frying them until they are golden brown in colour. They are normally served drizzled in fruit-and-vegetable based tonkatsu sauce with shredded cabbage and other crisp salad greens on the side. Tonkatsu are also often enjoyed as part of a bento boxed lunch, in a Japanese curry (known as 'katsu curry'), or as a sandwich filling.\n14. Kashipan\nThe Japanese love a good bread roll as much as the next person, and bakeries line Japan's city streets with almost as much regularity as ramen bars. The word \u2018kashipan\u2019 means \u2018sweet bread\u2019, and it refers to a range of single-serve bread buns that were originally invented in Japan. Among the most popular of these are melon pan (a bread bun with a cookie dough top), an pan (a bread bun filled with an or anko; a sweet red bean paste), and karee pan or kare pan (a bread bun filled with curry sauce, covered in panko breadcrumbs, and deep-fried). Kashipan are a must-try for bread lovers in particular.\n15. Sukiyaki\nLike oden, sukiyaki is a Japanese nabemono hot pot dish most commonly enjoyed during the winter. Sukiyaki hot pots are prepared by searing beef slices in the hot pot, then adding sukiyaki broth (normally made from soy sauce, sake, mirin rice wine and sugar) and different vegetables, noodles, and proteins. The name \u2018sukiyaki\u2019 means \u2018cook what you like\u2019, and the joy of sukiyaki comes from being able to prepare the dish with your fellow diners, at the table, using whatever ingredients you desire.\n16. Miso Soup\nFew Japanese dishes are consumed more often or more consistently than miso soup. Made from a combination of miso paste (a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soy beans) and dashi broth, miso soup is served as a side dish with traditional Japanese-style breakfasts, lunches and dinners. The complex savoury flavours of the soup help to enhance the umami of the main dishes with which it is served. To give the miso soup a little more body, several complementary toppings are normally added to it, such as green onion, wakame seaweed, and firm tofu.\n17. Okonomiyaki\nOkonomiyaki is made by mixing together batter, sliced cabbage, and other savoury ingredients; spooning the mixture onto a hot plate; and then pan-frying as you would a pancake. Okonomiyaki originated in Osaka and Hiroshima (where a different, \u2018layered\u2019 style of okonomiyaki exists) and its popularity spread to the rest of Japan, where specialised okonomiyaki restaurants are easy to come by. In some of these restaurants you are expected to prepare the okonomiyaki yourself, which makes for a delightfully fun cooking experience.\n18. Mentaiko\nLovers of salty seafood will reach the peak of their desires with mentaiko. This salty delicacy is made by marinating the roe (fish eggs) of pollock and cod in any of a number of salty, savoury, and spicy seasonings. The most basic mentaiko is marinated in a simple salt solution, while mentaiko marinated in spicy chilli pepper (known as 'karashi mentaiko') is becoming increasingly popular. Mentaiko is traditionally eaten as a side dish with steamed rice, as a topping on ramen, or as a filling in onigiri rice balls. In recent decades mentaiko has also been mixed with butter or cream to make a simple savoury or spicy mentaiko pasta sauce.\n19. Nikujaga\nA flavoursome savoury dish of meat, potatoes and assorted vegetables simmered in soy sauce, sake, mirin and sugar, Nikujaga meat and potato stew is one of a collection of Japanese dishes called 'nimono' (meaning \u2018simmered things\u2019). Although nikujaga is available in plenty of Japanese restaurants, it is also considered a homely dish that differs in flavour from household to household. For an authentic Japanese nikujaga experience, therefore, the best thing to do is get invited to a Japanese friend\u2019s house and put in a request with the family chef.\n20. Curry Rice\nKnown in Japanese as kare or kare raisu, Japanese curry is a yoshoku dish that was originally introduced to the Japanese by the British during the Meiji era (1868-1912).Japanese curry differs from the Indian varieties with which the UK is more familiar, in that it is generally sweeter in flavour, thicker in texture, and prepared more like a stew (with meat and vegetables being cooked by boiling in water together). Japanese curry is often prepared in Japanese homes with the help of curry roux; blocks of solidified Japanese curry paste that melt into the \u2018stew\u2019 and thicken up to become a flavoursome curry sauce.\n\u2018Unagi\u2019 is the Japanese word for \u2018freshwater eel\u2019, and unagi no kabayaki is one popular unagi dish that dates back to the Edo period (1603-1868), when Japanese people customarily ate kabayaki unagi during the summer in order to gain stamina. Unagi no kabayaki is made by brushing prepared eel fillets with a sweetened soy sauce-based kabayaki sauce and broiling them on a grill. The name \u2018kabayaki\u2019 refers to this method of cooking, and it can also be done with some other types of fish, including catfish. However, if you are in Japan during the summer, use the opportunity to try the genuine article.\n22. Shabu Shabu\nShabushabu is a nabemono hot pot dish similar to sukiyaki, made by\r\nboiling vegetables, tofu and other ingredients in a mellow broth seasoned with kombu kelp, and then dipping very thin slices of meat into the broth and swishing the meat around\r\nuntil it cooks (normally around 10-20 seconds). This meat is then dipped in a ponzu citrus seasoned soy sauce or sesame sauce before being eaten with some of the other boiled\r\ningredients. The name \u2018shabu shabu\u2019 is an onomatopoeia word for the noise the\r\nmeat slices make as they are swished around.\n23. Onigiri\nLike the sandwich could be considered the original portable food of British cuisine, the onigiri rice ball is the original portable food of Japan. Also known as \u2018omusubi\u2019, \u2018nigirimeshi\u2019, or just \u2018rice balls\u2019, onigiri are portions of Japanese rice, normally with a filling in the centre, that have been moulded into triangular or cylindrical shapes before being wrapped in nori seaweed. Onigiri have been enjoyed in Japan for hundreds of years, and most Japanese convenience stores nowadays sell a great range of onigiri for 100-150 yen (\u00a30.75-\u00a31.12) a piece. Popular onigiri fillings include umeboshi pickled plums, seasoned seaweed, tuna mayonnaise, and teriyaki chicken.\n24. Gyoza\nGyoza are savoury moon-shaped dumplings, made from a minced mixture of savoury fillings (pork mince, cabbage, green onion and mushroom is a common combination, but other fillings can be used as well) which are wrapped up in a circular gyoza wrapper and crimped or pleated around the edges to make an iconic half-moon shape. Gyoza dumplings are normally cooked by frying on one side (a process that gives the gyoza a crisp, savoury bottom), and then steaming for 2-3 minutes so that the rest of the rest of the wrapper is smooth and silky, and the filling inside is moist and juicy.\n25. Takoyaki\nAs far as Japanese street vendor foods are concerned, few are more notorious than takoyaki . Also known as 'octopus balls' or 'octopus dumplings', this delicacy is cooked using a special hot plate with rows of half-spherical moulds. Each of the moulds is filled with a savoury batter mixture before a bite-size piece of tako octopus meat is inserted into the middle. The takoyaki are turned with a pick or skewer every minute or so to ensure an evenly-cooked outside and a perfect ball-shaped dumpling in the end. Takoyaki are typically served in lots of six, eight or ten, brushed with a sweet/savoury takoyaki sauce and topped with mayonnaise, aonori seaweed and katsuobushi bonito fish flakes.\n26. Kaiseki Ryori\nIf you are hoping to experience the Japanese equivalent of haute cuisine, then you need to try kaiseki ryori. Also known simply as \u2018kaiseki\u2019, kaiseki ryori are traditional, multi-course Japanese dinners. A full kaiseki can involve a dozen or more different dishes made with fresh, seasonal, and/or local produce, each prepared in very small servings and in such a way as to enhance the produce\u2019s natural flavour. The courses in kaiseki all demonstrate a different cooking technique, and the complete experience is seen in Japan as an artform as much as a sit-down dinner. Kaiseki can normally be enjoyed in specialised restaurants or at ryokan (Japanese-style inns).\n27. Edamame\nWhile frequent pub-goers in the UK like to snack on peanuts and pork scratchings with their lagers, the regulars in Japan\u2019s izakaya pubs enjoy freshly prepared edamame. These bright green, immature soy beans, harvested before the beans have hardened, are normally served in the pod after being blanched and lightly salted. As well as boasting a naturally delicious and mellow umami flavour that works beautifully with light salt seasonings, edamame beans also carry a number of health benefits (being naturally high in protein, iron, and calcium). Edamame are often served in pubs and restaurants as a complimentary appetiser.\n28. Yakisoba\nIt is virtually impossible to attend a summer festival in Japan and not come across a yakisoba stand. Yakisoba is a fried noodle dish made by barbecuing or stir-frying a combination of noodles, sliced cabbage, pork, carrot and other vegetables, and a barbecue style yakisoba sauce. During the summer festivals large piles of these ingredients are thrown onto an outdoor hotplate and barbecued, but yakisoba can also easily be made at home using a large frying pan or wok. \u2018Yakisoba\u2019 means \u2018cooked soba\u2019, but unlike other soba noodles, the noodles used in yakisoba do not contain any buckwheat.\n29. Chawanmushi\nAs far as mellow, comforting, and uniquely Japanese dishes are concerned, chawanmushi is one of the best. This steamed, savoury egg custard is made by pouring seasoned, beaten eggs into individual cups already filled with different meats and vegetables (including chicken, mushrooms, gingko nuts, kamaboko fish cakes, and carrots), and then steaming the cups in a pot or steamer until they have solidified and become similar to pudding in texture. Chawanmushi gets its name by combining the words \u2018chawan\u2019 (meaning \u2018teacup\u2019)and \u2018mushi\u2019 (meaning \u2018steamed\u2019), so chawanmushi is, literally, \u2018steamed in a cup\u2019.\n30. Wagashi\nThe most authentic way to finish off a Japanese meal or matcha tea ceremony is with wagashi. Wagashi are traditional Japanese sweets , invented during the Edo period and influenced by prevalent Japanese ingredients and flavours. Most wagashi are made using only a handful of select ingredients, including mochi rice cakes, anko\u00a0paste, kanten (agar; a vegetarian thickener similar to gelatine), chestnuts, and sugar. The most popular wagashi include dango (sweet mochi balls on skewered sticks, often served with sugar syrup), daifuku (mochi rice stuffed with anko), dorayaki (anko sandwiched between two thick pancakes), and yokan (blocks of anko hardened with kanten and sugar).\n"

            "The 15 Most Popular Chinese Dishes, Tasty Chinese Food\nFind out what Chinese dishes to try in China (customer favorites): sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, fried noodles... See expert intros with pictures.\nWith a long history, unique features, numerous styles and exquisite cooking, Chinese cuisine is one important constituent part of Chinese culture. Chinese traditional dishes are famous for color, aroma, taste, meaning and appearance.\nThe following are the 15 most popular dishes among foreigners and Chinese. These dishes are available in most large restaurants in China. For convenience ordering, we also give their Chinese names.\nNo. 1 Hotpot\nHotpot (\u706b\u9505 hu\u01d2gu\u014d) is a \u201cdish\u201d to tell apart real Chinese food lovers. If you really appreciate hotpot rather than just ordering fired rice, chow mein, and dim sum all the time, you are truly a Chinese cuisine fan!\nThe secret of whether a hotpot is good or not lies in the broth, in which all the meat slices and vegetables are cooked. Normally you get to choose your own broth flavor, such as mushroom, tomato, original, or spicy. But still, the flavor can be different according to the sauce you choose to go with the meat. There are hundreds of kinds: a classic one is peanut butter with smashed garlic and chopped onion dressed with sesame oil.\nNo. 2\u00a0Sichuan Pork\nSichuan Pork, actually, poached spicy slices of pork (\u6c34\u716e\u8089\u7247 shu\u01d0zh\u01d4 r\u00f2upi\u00e0n) is a famous Sichuan cuisine dish.\nRather than cooking pork by stir-frying or deep-frying, which consumes lots of oil and can very easily overcook the pork, it is boiled in water with a coating made from egg-white and starch to preserve its freshness and tenderness.\nThe meaty broth is typical Sichuan cuisine, featuring a peppery and spicy taste. When eating, you\u2019ll find each piece of meat contains abundant juices with a fresh and fragrant spicy aroma.\nNo. 3\u00a0Braised Pork Balls in Gravy\nBraised pork balls in gravy (\u56db\u559c\u4e38\u5b50 s\u00ec x\u01d0 w\u00e1nzi) are also known as \u201cChinese meatballs\u201d (many of our clients call them this). If you like meatballs and spaghetti, you\u2019ll probably appreciate Chinese meatballs as well. The super-smooth and flavory gravy is almost like a \u201cdrug sauce\u201d keeping your taste buds wanting more and more. How many calories does it have? Trust me, you wouldn\u2019t care at all!\nTip: We suggest that you only order this dish in a decent restaurant where the meat quality is guaranteed and the prescribed lean:fat pork ratio of 7:3 is achieved in each meat ball.\nNo. 4 Shrimp with Vermicelli and Garlic\nShrimp with vermicelli and garlic (\u849c\u84c9\u7c89\u4e1d\u84b8\u867e su\u00e0nr\u00f3ng f\u011bns\u012b zh\u0113ng xi\u0101) is a dish not only favored by foreigners but also the Chinese younger generation in recent years as well.\nThis steamed dish brings out the aroma of everything it has. The heavy garlic with a seafood sauce flavor blends with the freshness of juicy shrimp. The vermicelli at the bottom absorbs every single drip of tasty juice running down. Some Chinese yellow wine to capture the aroma and highlight the flavor is the secret to this delicacy.\nNo.5\u00a0Dumplings\nDumplings (\u997a\u5b50 ji\u01ceozi) consist of minced meat and chopped vegetables wrapped in a thin dough skin. With a long history of more than 1,800 years, dumplings are a traditional food widely popular in North China.\nPopular fillings are mince pork, diced shrimp, ground chicken, beef, and vegetables. They can be cooked by boiling, steaming, or frying. Dumplings are a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve. See How to Make Chinese Dumplings .\nNo.6 Chow Mein\n\"Chow mein\" (\u7092\u9762 ch\u01ceomi\u00e0n) is the Cantonese pronunciation of the Chinese characters above, which means stir-fried noodles. Generally speaking, this stir-fried dish consists of noodles, meat (usually chicken, beef, shrimp, or pork), onions and celery.\nFor making chow mein, the noodles need to be cooked in boiling water for a while. After they becoming cool, then move to the step of stir-frying. See How to Cook Chow Mein .\nNo.7 Peking Roasted Duck\nPeking duck (\u5317\u4eac\u70e4\u9e2d B\u011bij\u012bng k\u01ceoy\u0101) is a famous dish from Beijing, enjoying world fame, and considered as one of China\u2019s national dishes.\nPeking duck is savored for its thin and crispy skin. The Sliced Peking duck is often eaten with pancakes, sweet bean sauce, or soy with mashed garlic. It is a must-taste dish in Beijing!

When all the ingredients have been cooked and their aroma has been brought out, they are stir-fried with rice till it becomes golden yellow.\nAuthentic Chinese Food Tours for Gourmets\nUnlike some tours that serve the same food menu all through a China trip, our private tours allow you to try different local dishes at each place.

This shop has a reputation for its Not So Plain Jane swiss rolls, a Matcha flavoured confectionary that's soft on the outside and creamy on the inside.

There aren't a lot of options on the menu, just a couple types of beans done in your preferred style as well seasonal cakes and bakes but that doesn't mean you shouldn't add this place to your caf\u00e9 hopping list.\nPhoto: The Daily Roundup\nRestaurants\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Posted on 19 August, 2014\nAsia is renowned for its mouthwatering cuisine, but its drinks are not too shabby either (in fact, the world\u2019s best-selling liquor is Asian: Korea\u2019s soju). \u00a0From the well-known crowd-pleasers (sake, bubble tea), to those that are more of an acquired taste (civet coffee, fermented mare\u2019s milk), here are some of the most popular drinks from 10 countries in Asia.\nHave you tried any of these?

            "Tommo\n15 Best Foods in Asia and where to find them\nTommo\nYou love Asian food? So do we. This is our guide to the best foods in Asia!\nTaste is always subjective. One man\u2019s spicy is another man\u2019s uncontrollable, red faced pain. One woman\u2019s sweet is another woman\u2019s diabetic nightmare. As foodie travellers there is one thing we can promise \u2013 We\u2019ve eaten a lot. In doing so, we\u2019ve drawn a bunch of comparisons in order to compile this list.\nOne year in Asia. Its been one hell of a journey, one which still continues. We\u2019ve eaten fantastically well and we\u2019ve discovered foods we\u2019d never even dreamed of.\nThere are a lot of great dishes that did not make the list. So, in no particular order, these are the best of the best foods in Asia and I\u2019m going to tell you why.\nXiaolongbao, Shanghai\nBurning. Explosion. Flavour. Searing. Amazing. That about sums up the consumption timeline of these bite size mouth volcanoes of infinite yum.\nIf you can stand to wait \u2013 most can\u2019t \u2013 then give them a few minutes to cool down first. We\u2019ve had these in many places across China and other Asian countries. Shanghai is still the best.\nThe Xiaolongbao, or soup dumpling, was featured on an episode of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s \u201cNo Reservations\u201d. Unlike the ones he tried, in a fancy restaurant, we ate at a regular hole in the wall sort of place. They were cheap, filling and perfect. Also unlike the giant ones he ate, first supping the juice with a straw, these are of a regular down-in-one size.\nThey may not be the most famous in the Shanghai food scene, but you will not be disappointed.\nTip: Go for the original pork filling \u2013 anything else just isn\u2019t as good.\nPrice: About 12 yuan ($2) for a serve of 12 small dumplings\nLocation: JiaJiaTangBao Restaurant, Huanghe Lu, Near Nanjing Xilu, Shanghai. Food Map\nPork Belly Korean BBQ. Itaewon, Seoul\nBest Foods In Asia: Korean Pork Belly BBQ\nSouth Korea is the most expensive country we visited for food over the last year. Although it is possible to get a meal for under $5 you\u2019ll be stuck with some pretty basic chow.\nIf you want a real taste of Korea then you can\u2019t skip the BBQ. Fortunately, of all the places we tried, one of the best was also one of the best value at 10,000 won ($8.50) for the pork belly set meal.\nThere menu is minimalistic. You either choose the pork belly or the ribs. Although other choices exist, I\u2019m telling you, and so is every other customer in this always busy restaurant, those are the two choices. As with most Korean meals, this one choice is not all you are served. An incredible array of side dishes and condiments will arrive to envelop your table.\nThere are a variety of styles of Korean BBQ. From a basic charcoal grill to a fancy gas hotplate, this place used one of the more modern looking techniques. You get an individual griddle hotplate for your table. It\u2019s on a slant so that the fat runs away from the meat. This style may not be unique in Korea but there was a twist\u2026\nA selection of shredded veg is placed at the drainage end of the grill. Every delicious drip of pork fat runs through and cooks the veg. Wow. The delicious and crispy pork belly is grilled and then eaten as a lettuce wrap with a mix and match of condiments and sides. Add some of the pork, fatted veg along with salt and the ubiquitous \u201cred sauce\u201d and you are looking at one of the best taste parcels in Korea.\nWash it down with a glass of Soju for the authentic experience.\nPrice: 10,000 Won ($8.50) per person, plus 3,000 won for a small bottle of soju.\nLocation: Its down a side street near directly south behind the Itaewon metro stop. There are loads of restaurants down that street, this one has a pig with its thumb up. Check the food map for precise location .\nBest Foods In Asia: Burmese Ginger Salad\nWhen referring to Burmese salads, the word \u201csalad\u201d seems like a misnomer. What we are talking about here is a selection of nuts and vegetables covered in oil. It tastes way better than it sounds but you will not be losing any weight.\nLike any salad, the two main factors are fresh ingredients and an excellent dressing. The recipe for the dressing seemed to be relatively consistent in the many places we tried the various salads \u2013 a national Burmese secret perhaps. In any traditional local restaurant, even if not on the menu, just ask for one of the salads and normally they\u2019ll throw one together.\nThe ginger salad is literally chunks of ginger with nuts, crispy fried soya beans and maybe some tomato.\nThe tomato salad is largely tomato and cabbage but also with plenty of nuts etc. too.\nWhat is Burmese cuisine? It\u2019s not a nation that has had widespread international recognition. Read more about Burmese cuisine .\nPrice: 300-500 kyat (about 50 cents)\nLocation: All over Burma, especially in Shan State.\nEggplant with minced pork, Hong Kong\nI\u2019ve never been the biggest fan of eggplant. Even in moussaka, which I enjoy, I have to eat it whilst thinking \u201cthis doesn\u2019t have eggplant in\u201d, even though I know it does.\nIn Hong Kong I was converted forever. It\u2019s probably because, before the eggplant is added to the mix, it is deep fried. Then it is fried up with minced pork \u2013 vegetarian food is not really a thing in China \u2013 and a tomato based sauce.\nIt\u2019s another one of those dishes that you just don\u2019t seem to find in a typical Chinese restaurant outside of China/Hong Kong but many restaurants in the Cantonese parts of China have it. Just show them the following text and get ready for a taste bud treat.\nPrice: About 60 $HK (Around $8)\nLocation: Food Map .\u00a05 Fung Cheung Road, Yuen Long. A selection of street restaurants in this area in the evening. On the corner.\nJawain Butter Parantha, Amritsar, India\nThere are only three times of day when Kesar restaurant is quiet, two of those are during the observed temple times, the other is when they are closed. Head in just before 7pm or just before 1pm to ensure you miss the rush.\nI\u2019ve always thought the French were the kings of bread. Nothing better than a fresh baguette or croissant. I was wrong. Here, in this unassuming dhaba restaurant on a tiny backstreet of Amritsar, we found the lord of baking.\nFor 40 rupees you get the crispiest, most buttery parantha (or \u201cparatha\u201d) bread in India, probably in the world. Just like pizza in Naples, a bread has changed my life and created a need to return to a city that has little else drawing me back.\nYou\u2019ll want something to dip that bread in. We reckon the Palak Paneer (Cheese and spinach curry) is one of the best curries at this place. The \u201cdal fry\u201d is a local favourite though we were not so impressed with it.\nYou may come to Amritsar on a pilgrimage to the Golden temple, heartland of Sikkhism, but you\u2019ll return again for the parantha.\nPrice: 40 rupees (80 cents) for the amazing bread. Curries to accompany start at around 30 rupees for a basic chana (chick pea) or Dal (lentils). We recommend the palak paneer for 100 rupees.\nLocation: Kesar da Dhaba, Amritsar, India.\nEgg tarts, Hong Kong\nHong Kong Style Egg Tart\nAnother simple, yet perfect dish \u2013 good for breakfast or as a snack.\nIt\u2019s all about the pastry. Although egg tarts are popular throughout China and other parts of the far east, there is a difference. Most of them are made in the Portuguese style, with flaky puff pastry. In Hong kong they are made with sweet, rich and buttery short crust pastry.\nSorry Portugal, it\u2019s not just because I\u2019m English, seriously, the egg tarts aren\u2019t as good in the UK either. The Hong kong interpretation of this classic is just better.\nPrice: 2 to 7 $HK each ($0.3 to $1 each)\nLocation: Any bakery, of which there are hundreds. From metro stations to down small residential streets.\nCilantro/enoki mushrooms wrapped in tofu/bacon (BBQ), China\nEnoki Mushrooms wrapped in Bacon\nChinese BBQ. The choices are endless. The availability is country-wide in China. For all the universal options, there was one, well two, BBQ items we just kept coming back to\u2026 Coriander (cilantro) leaves or enoki mushrooms wrapped in tofu (or sometimes bacon).\nThe fragrant flavour of the coriander works perfectly with the neutral tasting tofu. It\u2019s one powerful bite of herbal enjoyment. As for the Enoki mushrooms\u2026 They are mushrooms. When wrapped in bacon, well\u2026 its bacon. Enough said.\nAside from the awesomeness of the BBQ items, the whole atmosphere of street BBQ in China keeps you coming back in itself. During summer months little plastic chairs everywhere are packed with people enjoying food, beer and a chat. It\u2019s a massive social event.\nPrice: Prices vary but maybe 2 to 6 yuan per stick of 3 pieces (30 cents to $1)\nLocation: During summer, about 50% of the ever pervasive street side BBQ stalls sell this. Some suggested areas are on the Food map . The Harbin University district was a particular favourite \u2013 including 2 liter jugs of draught beer for about 12 yuan ($2) too.\nSome of these International foods might not agree with your stomach \u2013 so please be careful and always have travel insurance in case you get sick. Read Our Guide Comparing Insurance Companies and get the right policy and price for you.\nChicken Rotisserie. Oslob, Philippines\nAs we swigged our San Miguel, we watched bus after loaded bus pull up at the small roadside rotisserie opposite. Bus drivers jumped out, holding up their passengers, grabbed a couple of whole roast chickens and then were on there way. The bus route ran the length of Cebu Island. But this was the place the drivers got their chicken.\nThere was no way we were going to miss trying this.\nSucculent and juicy are two words that food marketers throw around to describe tasty chicken. These people have made a huge mistake. What they\u2019ve gone and done is never eaten a roast chicken in Oslob. Until you have had this perfect chicken you have no way of really understanding what a succulent and juicy chicken is.\nThis tiny town has two draw cards, you can swim with whale sharks and you can eat the best goddamn roast chicken in the world. We went for the sharks, we\u2019d go back for the chicken.\nThe little blue roadside stand \u201cDelto\u2019s Litson Manok\u201d (also pronounced \u201cDelto\u2019s Lechon Manok\u201d) is the place.\nPrice: 160 pesos ($4) for a whole chicken. 10 pesos for sticky rice. 20 pesos for chorizo on a stick \u2013 also a must try.\nLocation: The blue rotisserie stand on the main road through Oslob. Its a small town. Check the map for precise location .\nPaneer Korma (and others). Jaipur, India.\nKhandelwal Pavitra Bhojnalaya have been serving food for over 20 years. Its a very popular Dhaba restaurant.\n3 weeks travelling across north India and this is it. The best curry, or curries. They all look the same but they all have there own individual flavour profile. What they have in common is the rich, vibrant and warm mouth feel that a perfect north Indian curry should have. Its not just about chilli, anyone can add chilli, its about the balance of spices that leave your taste buds desperate for more \u2013 you can\u2019t stop eating.\nThe blend is so good that you can taste every single spice individually rolling around on your palate but the overall profile is so amazing that they all come together as one coherent, taste-bud popping food experience.\nThe korma was great \u2013 nothing like the yellow coconut style korma you\u2019d get in England \u2013 the mushroom masala was also excellent but really, i don\u2019t think you could go wrong with any of the major curries off the menu.\nThis restaurant is very close to the water temple, it\u2019s a little out of town but well worth the trip. More so for the food than the temple visit.\nPrice: About 150 rupees ($3) for a curry.\nLocation: Khandelwal Pavitra Bhojnalaya Restaurant. Just south of the water temple on the main road. North of Jaipur.\nEgg & Tomato. Dandong, China.\nThe Chinese dish that is available almost everywhere in China but you\u2019ve never seen it outside China.\nIt\u2019s mind blowingly simple. So simple, in fact, that our conspiracy theory is that no one would pay restaurant prices for such a cheap dish, so it is left out of international Chinese menus.\nAdmittedly we only found it as street food or in food courts. Never paying more than a dollar for a large portion.\nWe now make it ourselves as it\u2019s so easy: Scrambled egg simmered with tomatoes, salt, sugar and water. If you want, and I do, add a dash of soy and some garlic too. Takes 5 minutes to make. Tastes delicious.\nPrice: About 6 yuan ($1 ish) for a full plate.\nLocation: This is available in food courts and budget restaurants all over China. Check out our food map for a couple of the locations we had this.\nGarlic Chicken. Seoul\nI hope you like garlic. This is not garlic chicken. I would better describe it as garlic infused with chicken, or at least that\u2019s how it tastes. In fact there is plenty of chicken in this deep fried delight. South Koreans, you may not be aware, are crazy about fried/roast chicken. In fact, beer and chicken is one of the quintessential eating experiences in SK. As you walk the streets, it\u2019s impossible to miss the beer/chicken restaurant logos.\nWe ate more than our fair share of chicken during our 6 weeks in SK. I guess a lot of Koreans will have a local favourite. We actually discovered our favourite in a chain style restaurant:\u00a0KKAMDAG.\nIf you don\u2019t love garlic, this will be overwhelming. For us it was a pleasure.\nPrice: 16,000 won ($14) for two people.\nLocation: KKAMDAG, Seoul.\u00a0KKAMDAG restaurant. Like much of Korea, English words on restaurants are minimal. The approximate location is on the food map as it has been impossible to find the exact location using the English spelling. Ask for directions when you get to the area. Here is a photo of the front of the building:\nLittle potatoes on a stick, Burma\nPotatoes on a stick, you say? How is this in a top Asian foods list? Forget your preconceptions. When someone goes to the effort to produce the best BBQ potatoes on this earth, they deserve a mention. Yes, I would rather eat these potatoes on a stick than Peking duck, than Pad Thai, than a whole load of other things that didn\u2019t make it onto this list. They are that good.\nThe best thing is, you can get them at almost any BBQ stall or bar throughout all of the major destinations in Burma. Furthermore, at about 10 cents per stick (5 pieces on a stick) these tiny, sweet par-boiled potatoes, that are then grilled with a light, spicy marinade, are very affordable.\nWhen it comes to Burmese BBQ, its not always grilled. Look out for the \u201cdeep fried BBQ\u201d stations where everything on a stick is thrown straight into a vat of hot oil. Read more about Burmese Cuisine .\nPrice: 100-200kyat per stick (10 to 20 cents)\nLocation: BBQ stations are all over Burma. Aside from the smaller street side stalls and local restaurants, many of the beer stations have an attached BBQ restaurant. Just look for the Myanmar Beer sign. A couple of suggestions are on the food map .\nGlass noodle salad. Koh samui, Thailand\nWe had this in many places in Thailand, but the one in Koh samui was the best. Over to Megsy to tell you about glass noodle salad\u2026\nLooking for a tasty, healthier salad option? Then look no further than Thailand\u2019s very own glass noodle salad, also known as Yum Woon Sen. This is not a dish for any soft foodies out there. Give this dish a chance and it will literally burn your face off, due to the insane amounts of fresh chilli. 5DT says \u2013 mmmm yum!\nMany of Thai dishes we\u2019ve encountered seem to be set to farang (foreigner) standard, which is usually quite lame in the hotness department for our standards. However there is no pussying around when it comes to this dish. Dig in and let your nose run free, cause with about 4-6 Thai chillies added, as a minimum, this dish is set to flush clear those sinuses.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the chillies. There is also the addition of fresh vegetables, peanuts and cilantro (coriander) that give it that distinct and delicious Asian flavour. The dressing is made with Thai fish sauce, fresh lime juice and sugar so it\u2019s not a vegetarian option. If you are vego and travelling through Thailand, keep an eye out for many dressings made this way\u2026.they love fish sauce!\nIf you\u2019re looking for a delicious salad that is a great option for a humid Thailand day, then give Yum Woon Sen a try. But remember it does come with an advisory label\u2026 Warning: Dish May Contain Chilli Insanity!\nPrice: 40 baht and up. In Koh Samui we paid about 60 baht.\nLocation: Sea Breeze Bungalows, Lamai beach, Koh Samui . You can find this dish all over Thailand though. Ask for a less spicy version if you can\u2019t take the heat.\nHong Kong\u00a0Hot Pot\nYou\u2019ve undoubtedly heard of hot pot. All around China there are a multitude of styles for this \u201cAsian fondue\u201d. The typical style is a circular dish, often split into two sides, with either a clear, mild flavour broth, an oily and spicy Szechuan broth, or both. You throw your selection of meat and veg in, then you wait.\nBut one style of hotpot we found stood out as very different. This was in the new territories, Hong Kong.\nWe were lucky to be staying with a friend who was a local. We walked past multiple fancy looking restaurants, down a grimy alley, along a canal to a hole in the wall place with some fold out tables outside ready for eager diners on a budget.\nDrinks were \u201cself-service\u201d from the small convenience store next door. The hot pot itself, unlike its simpler cousins in most of China, was crammed full of chicken, bones, feet and all, vegetables and massive pieces of various spices such as ginger root and garlic. This was already a casserole before we added our optional choices: Squid, thin sliced beef, tofu rolls and, upon the insistence of our hosts, goose intestines.\nAlthough the entrails of a wild foul were not my favourite addition, the overall flavour of the pot itself is what makes this dish better than any hot pot I\u2019ve had before or since \u2013 and I\u2019ve had a few! A traditional pot is simple in flavour so as not to overpower the taste of the added meats etc. This Hong Kong hot pot was the main even in itself and it was perfect.\nPrice: 150 HK$ (US$20) Serves 4 people. Each side plate of meats/veg is about HK$30.\nLocation: Food Map . \u9577\u4f86\u98df\u574a (Cheung Loi Restaurant). 11 Yu Wing Path,Yuen Long\nBONUS: Tom n Toms Pretzel (Pepperoni), South Korea\nIf you\u2019ve met me, you\u2019ll know I like cheese. In fact, within a few minutes of making my acquaintance you\u2019ll discover my deep rooted infatuation with all things fromage, even if you didn\u2019t want to know.\nOne of the downsides of travelling in East Asia is the severe lack of cheese. This has been somewhat of a low point in my consumption of dairy products. So, for all the Asian foods on this list, it seemed fitting that we could include some cheese in a sea of non-cheese.\nTom n Toms is an American cafe chain in South Korea. As a non-American, it\u2019s not somewhere I\u2019d ever heard of. What they\u2019ve gone and done is imported the cheesy pretzel awesomeness that you would normally only find in the US and brought it to Korea.\nAfter months of eating processed burger cheese to get my fix, even on pizzas, Tom n Toms was a beacon in an Asian cheese abyss. Cheese oozed from the mouth scorching pretzel. Equilibrium in my life was once again restored.\nPrice: 4,200 won (about $3.75).\nLocation: Every major city in South Korea seems to have at least one store. Just search \u201cTom n Toms\u201d on google maps for Korea.\nSome of these International foods might not agree with your stomach \u2013 so please be careful and always have travel insurance in case you get sick.

Put your bartering to the test in Istanbul\u2019s cavernous Grand Bazaar.\nFounded in the mid-15th century, this historic mall has swelled to more than 3,000 shops, peddling silver jewellery, spices, Turkish delight rolled in pistachios, and the city\u2019s legendary carpets (best skipped if you\u2019re flying hand-luggage only).\nPrices are agreed in a style that\u2019s centuries old: light banter and a glass of mint tea. Suggest 60-70% of the first price you\u2019re offered, smile as you barter, take your time, and agree on a price somewhere in the middle.\nIf this behemoth of bazaars sounds overwhelming, venture to Arasta Bazaar behind the Blue Mosque, a small array of stalls with luxurious\u00a0cottons and ceramics.\nWhere\u2019s your favourite shopping destination?

            "10 of the best outdoor activities in and around Tokyo\nThere are plenty of ways to enjoy Tokyo outdoors, whether you fancy a boat trip around Tokyo Bay, taking in the view from the Tokyo Tower or climbing Mount Takao, says Justin McCurry\nFirst published on Wed 1 Feb 2012 10.00\u00a0GMT\nMount Takao\nThe Japanese have been making the pilgrimage to Mount Takao for more than 1,200 years; now they share the sacred mountain's slopes with tourists searching for \"old Japan\" \u2013 all within an hour of Shinjuku station. On a clear day, the 599m summit offers views of Tokyo and Mount Fuji, and the less energetic can take a cable car or chairlift halfway up the six hiking trails. Takao is still considered an important religious site, so don't be surprised to find yourself sharing a trail with ascetic Buddhists on their way to pray at Yakuo-in temple or cleanse themselves beneath the freezing waterfalls of Biwa-daki or Hebi-daki. Go in March and you can even join them in a spot of fire walking . Wait about an hour after the embers start glowing to keep pain to a minimum.\nCycling in Yoyogi Park\nPhotograph: salvo severino / Alamy\nTokyo has been described as one of the best cities in the world to discover by bicycle. It's relatively flat but with enough hilly neighbourhoods to keep things interesting, and while parts of the city can become gridlocked, the air quality is pristine compared with, say, Bangkok or Hong Kong. Given its size, you could cycle for a week and still only scratch the surface of Tokyo. So where to start? The Tokyo Bay area is a favourite among locals, but for a more secluded ride, complete with clearly marked cycling lanes, Yoyogi Park, a vast expanse of greenery near the trendy Harajuku neighbourhood, is hard to beat. Tokyo Rentabike does all-day rentals for under \u00a310.\n\u2022 tokyorentabike.com . Read about the exploits of a keen Tokyo cyclist at tokyobybike.com\nTokyo Tower\nPhotograph: Yoshinori Kuwahara/Getty Images/Flickr RF\nPoor old Tokyo Tower: it has been demolished several times by Godzilla, had its antenna bent in the 2011 earthquake and was rendered obsolete by the digital age. But as a vantage point for some of finest views of Tokyo, its future is guaranteed \u2013 for now. Located in Shiba Park, the 333m structure, modelled on the Eiffel Tower but painted orange and white to comply with air safety regulations, has two observation decks \u2013 at 150m and then 250m for those with a head for heights. Due to open across town in May is Tokyo Sky Tree , now the country's tallest man-made structure, at 634m. It's worth a trip for the view from 450m \u2013 mercifully, there's a lift \u2013 or simply to stay on firm ground and marvel at its size.\ntokyotower.co.jp , adults from around \u00a37, children \u00a34\nJogging round the Imperial Palace\nPhotograph: Alamy\nFor the most part, Tokyoites tend to rub along nicely \u2013 no mean feat for a city of almost 13 million people. The path running around the grounds of the Imperial Palace, however, is the scene of the occasional contretemps involving pedestrians and the hordes of joggers. It's a safe distance from traffic, the views of the skyscrapers hugging the park's perimeter are impressive, and no one will sneer if you turn up in cheap running gear and proceed at a crawl. Along the route are markers for all of Japan's 47 prefectures \u2013 with a leap of imagination you could be running the length and breadth of the country. Just keep an eye out for perambulating tourists.\nYakatabune boat trip\nPhotograph: Atlantide Phototravel/Corbis\nYakatabune \u2013 literally roof boats \u2013 are supposed to resemble traditional Japanese homes, with their long, low tables, tatami mats and plentiful supplies of sashimi and tempura. Several companies operate yakatabune as pleasure boats in Tokyo Bay for groups who like to do their socialising at sea. In summer, a yakatabune trip is one of the best ways to view the firework festivals, while the night-time views of the island of Odaiba and the illuminated Rainbow suspension bridge are always impressive. A word of caution: the drink-all-you-can deal is enticing, but remember that a yakatabune dinner entails at least a couple of hours at sea on a fairly small boat.\n\u2022 +81 3 3644 1344, harumiya.co.jp , English-speaking staff available, \u00a510,500pp (around \u00a390) including sashimi, tempura, unlimited drinks and karaoke\nOdaiba-Asakusa river bus\nPhotograph:Jose Fuste Raga/Corbis\nOne of the best ways to navigate Tokyo's streets is, oddly, by boat. The Sumida river buses weave through the heart of the city to one of three destinations. The most popular route connects Odaiba and Asakusa, passing the Asahi Beer hall and its infamous \"golden turd\" statue. The trip is a contrast in streetscapes: the former is best known for the Rainbow Bridge and the space-age headquarters of Fuji TV, the latter a wonderfully disorderly collection of narrow streets, old buildings and Sensoji Temple , instantly recognisable by the huge akachochin red lantern marking its entrance. Wander around the street market and don't leave Asakusa without trying a beer and Denki Bran (electric brandy) chaser at the Kamiya Bar .\n\u2022 suijobus.co.jp , adults around \u00a313 single, under-12s around \u00a38, under-6s free\nUrban fishing\nPhotograph: Alamy\nAnglers who prefer the smell of early-morning dew as they bait up would probably be horrified, but if you prefer convenience and almost guaranteed results, it is possible to catch freshwater fish right in the heart of Tokyo. The Sumida and Tamagawa rivers aside, the best option for tourists is a day at Ichigaya fish centre, a collection of five rectangular pools filled with small carp and fed by the waters of the Kanda river. Ichigaya might also appeal to those with a competitive streak: anglers weigh their catch at the end of each hour \u2013 reach 7kg and you can fish free for another hour.\n\u2022 Ichigaya Tamachi 1-1, Shinjuku-ku, +81 3 3260 1324, ichigaya-fc.com/fishing , one hour costs around \u00a36, rod and bait extra\nKamakura\nPhotograph: Alison Wright/Corbis\nIf time or budget rules out a long trip to the temples of Kyoto or the tranquillity of the far north, the best option for a mini break from Tokyo is Kamakura. The ancient capital is less than an hour from the city, but aesthetically, it's a world away. Stroll around Kamakura's cultural and natural attractions: Engakuji Temple, the Great Buddha at Kotokuin Temple and a walk along Yuigahama beach which, weather permitting, comes with a bonus view of Mount Fuji. Dining on a shojin ryori vegetarian meal will prepare you for the uphill hike to the farthest reaches of Kenchoji Temple, the most important Zen Buddhist structure in Kamakura, with breathtaking views of the city below.\nPhotograph: Alamy\nTokyo has no shortage of green spaces, and Inokashira Park, in the west of the city, is among the best. It's easily navigable on foot, but large enough to stay interesting, with a forest, a boating pond, sports facilities, and a small zoo and aquarium. At weekends and holidays there's an art market. It is also home to Ghibli Museum, devoted to the studio behind Hayao Miyazaki's much-loved anime films such as Spirited Away. The park also benefits from its proximity to Kichijoji, a neighbourhood popular among young Tokyoites, who flock to its bars, restaurants and clubs.\n\u2022 ghibli-museum.jp/en , adults around \u00a38.50, reduced rates for children depending on age, make sure to reserve before leaving for Japan. Open Wed-Mon 10am-6pm\nHakone\nTorii Gate at the Hakone Shrine. Photograph: Atlantide Phototravel/Corbis\nFor all their charms, Tokyo's urban onsen are ultimately a poor imitation of the hot-spring resorts found all over Japan. Immersion in a genuine onsen is as easy as jumping on a train at Shinjuku bound for Hakone, 70 minutes away. Most of Hakone falls within a volcanically active national park centring on Lake Ashi, and the area is packed with public bath houses and ryokan (inns), many of which open their doors to day bathers. But to do Hakone justice, find a reasonably priced ryokan and take a couple of days to explore the volcanic geysers of Owakudani, the botanical gardens, the cherry blossom in spring and Hakone shrine on the shore of the lake.\nPublished: 1 Feb 2012\nPublished: 1 Feb 2012\nPublished: 1 Feb 2012\nPublished: 1 Feb 2012\nClose\n"

The camps have walk-in tents, Thermarest mattresses, sit-down toilets, shower tents and excellent staffs to cook dinners over campfires and, at one camp, roast stones for hot baths.\nThe Lares Adventure\nThe word is out on the Salkantay Trail\u2014the (somewhat) less crowded, equally stunning alternative to following the Inca Trail through the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu. Launched some ten years ago, Mountain Lodges of Peru upended the usual pop-tent camping situation by building highly luxurious lodges\u2014think private hot tubs on the terraces\u2014along their own, slightly different route. That seven-day tour remains the locally owned, preservation-minded company\u2019s flagship, but it recently launched a shorter, easier alternative called the Lares Adventure, which caters to guests who want to encounter the indigenous culture rather than commit to hours of strenuous hiking every day (or who want an option other than walking in case the weather is bad).\nThe Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route\nAnn Abel\nThe Kumano Kodo pilgrimage with Walk Japan\nOne of only two UNESCO-registered pilgrimage routes in the world (the other is the famous Camino de Santiago in Spain), this series of ancient trails traces 1,000\u00a0years of Buddhist history on the forested, misty Kii Peninsula. It encompasses\u00a0Koyasan, Kumano and the Ise shrine, places where Buddhism originated in Japan in the 6th century. The nature is punctuated with active monasteries, hushed temples and Shintro shrines, and massive torii gates in the fields. There\u2019s an overwhelming amount of spirituality and history to take in along with the cypress trees and plunging waterfalls, but Walk Japan demystifies it for Western hikers. The guides are Western academics who have lived in Japan for years, and the comfortable accommodations include temples, onsen hot spring resorts and traditional Japanese inns.\nThe W in Patagonia\nAlta Via 1\nFew European trekking destinations are as mythic as the Dolomites, the high, craggy pinnacles of northeastern Italy. The Alta Via is said to offer the \u201cbest of the best\u201d of the mountains\u2019 thousands of trails, with challenging terrain, endlessly changing landscapes and lively \u201chuts\u201d that reflect the best of Alpine Italian hospitality. Of the eight Alta Via routes, number 1 is the most iconic. (With the operator Dolomite Mountains the overnights are in fact in charming alpine lodges with private bedrooms and mostly private bathrooms, whatever they want to call them.) The nine-day trip begins in the S\u00fcdtirol and winds south through the Fanes area, Lagazuoi and other Cortina mountains, Pelmo, Civetta, Moiazza and the Dolomiti Bellunesi\u2014with some outstanding food and wine along the way.\nVail to Aspen\nThis five-day llama trek through the Colorado Rockies combines crystalline skies, meadows lush with wildflowers and rugged ridges with comfortable overnights at the three of the historic 10th Mountain Division huts \u2014whose builders and re-builders include the father of the founder of Paragon Guides\u2014and the Diamond J Guest Ranch. Built in the 1980s, the huts commemorate the Army veterans who trained at nearby Camp Hale during World War II before being shipped out to Italy, where they fell in love with hut-to-hut hiking culture. This trip uses three of the most comfortable, with shared and private bedrooms, woodstoves\u00a0and\u00a0guides who cook hearty dinners.\nCheck out my website .\nRead More\nI've been a travel writer and editor for 18 years \u2013 including several as a senior editor at ForbesLife \u2013 and I've written about more than 600 luxury destinations and hotels in 95 countries (and counting). I know the difference between what\u2019s merely expensive and what deserves its high price tag.

The rain kept the heat away but made the 12 km ride uphill more dangerous and challenging. It was our fourth day cycling in Taiwan, the hardest and the most beautiful one. I wasn\u2019t sure if Nat and I would be able to cycle Taiwan\u2019s east coast and if we would survive the 4 days of full cycling, but we did it and it was an adventure of a lifetime.\nTaiwan is famous for exporting bikes all over the world. While the bikes leave the island to the streets of Asia, Europe and America, every year more and more people are traveling to Taiwan for cycling. Taiwan is a cycling paradise attracting professional and amateur cyclists from all around the globe. Cycling in Taiwan is a mix of adventures, stunning nature, local experiences and fun, perfect ingredients for an unforgettable trip.\nWhat makes cycling in Taiwan such an incredible experience?\nThe answer is simple: biking in Taiwan is a serious business. They even have a festival to celebrate their bike culture, the Taiwan Cycling Festival that happens in November. The Formosa 900 is the biggest event during the cycling festival, a 9 days cycling tour around the island covering a distance of 900 km.\nWell, Taiwanese people love to cycle and there are many cycling routes in the country. The roads are safe, there are many cycling lanes and the drivers do respect the cyclists. The nature in Taiwan is stunning and you can cycle from easy to challenging routes.\nTaiwan produces great bikes, from urban models to mountain bikes and speed bikes, and you can easily rent them from point A and return them to point B. If you are planning a cycling holiday in Taiwan there is no need to travel on your own bike.\nYou\u2019ll never be alone when cycling in Taiwan, there is a big sense of community among the Taiwanese cyclists and if you need help they will be there for you. Plus, all the police stations along the roads are officially bike aid stations , so if you need to rest, to use the toilet , to fix your bike or ask for directions, stop at the police station and you will be in good hands. Not to mention the endless amount of 7-11 shops that you will find along Taiwan\u2019s cycling routes. These convenience shops are a safe harbor where you can buy cold & hot drinks, warm soups, sandwiches, coffees or even rest in the aircon and use the toilets.\nPhoto by Shin Yeo\nYou can cycle around Taiwan by yourself, in a group or on a guided tour. Our Taiwan bike adventure was in a group of 13 people from all around the world with the same target: cycling Taiwan\u2019s east coast and having fun while doing it. The group was a great mix, four of us were really good cyclists, a couple of us had no previous experience and the rest of the team were all good cyclists. And \u00a0that was ok, because at the end of the day what really mattered was our passion for having a good time and for pushing our limits. If you have never cycled long distances before I recommend you to go on a cycling tour in Taiwan.\nNow we\u2019re gonna break our four days biking in Taiwan down to help you plan your cycling itinerary. It will be divided into daily routes with starting and ending points, the distances we cycled and our perception about the cycling trip.\nPhoto by Shin Yeo\nCycling in Taiwan east coast: itinerary and tips\nOur Taiwan cycling itinerary started at Hualien, inside the Taroko National Park and ended at Checheng town. The Taiwan east coast route is the most famous one and offers amazing landscapes, great cycling experiences and you can have a taste of the local life. The west coast is where the big cities, the big ports and industries are. For us, it was like two different countries in the same island, one busy and modern and the other calm, raw and packed with friendly locals.\nOur Taiwan cycling itinerary started at Hualien, inside Taroko National Park and it ended in \u00a0Checheng town. Taiwan\u2019s east coast route is the most famous one and it offers amazing landscapes, great cycling experiences and you can have a taste of the local life. The west coast is where the big cities, the big ports and industries are. For us, it felt like there were two different countries on the same island, a \u00a0busy and modern one and a calm, raw and packed with friendly locals one.\nCycling in Taiwan\u2019s east coast day 1:\nCycling from Taroko National Park to Fenglin Township, Hualien County\nDistance: 67 km\nWe started our Taiwan cycling tour in Taipei where we got the train to Hualien to meet our guides and to get our bikes. There are trains departing from Taipei to Hualien every hour and you can board them with your bike. From Hualien Train Station we hopped on a bus to reach Taroko National Park . A traffic jam due to road renovations delayed our arrival at the starting point and our team had only a few minutes to prepare the bikes and start cycling before the road was open for the cars again.\nExpectations and anxiety built up and we were off to 10km downhill through the stunning landscape of Taroko Gorge. The sharp curves and the traffic added an extra challenge to this ride, I enjoyed it a lot but I was a bit worried about Nat. She was not used to cycling on busy roads, actually she wasn\u2019t used to cycling long distances at all. The photo breaks were great for admiring the stunning nature and also for Nat to catch her breath up.\nExiting the park we cycled for about 17 km on flat roads to reach Xincheng Township where we would have lunch, the heat was killing us. Seafood for me, vegetarian dishes for Nat, aircon and a cold tea put us back into shape for the second half of the day.\nThe route from Xincheng Township to Fengling Township included a 23 km long easy ascend, followed by a 10km descend and finished with 7 more km up. On the way we crossed villages, rice fields and the beautiful Lyu Lake. Luckily the sun wasn\u2019t that strong so the heat didn\u2019t drain us that much. We reached our hotel at night time, tired and starving. It was time for a shower, dinner and chatting with the group about our first day.\nWe had a support car following our group and two guides cycling with us all the time, one leading the squad \u00a0and the other following behind making sure everybody was still alive. Every hour or so we stopped for photos, drinks, resting or to get the squad back \u00a0together. Nat was the first one to get a flat tire which was promptly replaced by our support team. On the first day, we revealed our addiction by stopping several times at 7-11 shops to get iced coffees. By the end of the cycling trip, we were not the only ones.\nCycling from Fenglin Township to Chishang Township, Taitung County\nDistance: 99 km\nAfter a good night of sleep and a replenishing breakfast we were ready for our second day cycling in Taiwan\u2019s east coast. The morning ride was supposed to be an easy one, about 50 km of which 7 were ascending until our lunch break. The route was easy, the issue again was the heat. The sun was terrible, Nat needed to stop for a while in the shade to cool down. The bright side is that we cycled by tea plantations with beautiful mountains along the road.\nPhoto by Shin Yeo\nThe afternoon was reserved for one of the most beautiful cycling paths I\u2019ve ever been to, Yufu Cycling Pathway . Built over a former railway track it crossed lush green rice fields with impressive mountains in the background. And on our way to Chishang we saw vast pineapple, noni, sugar cane and dragon fruit fields.\nThe second day was easier than the previous one, I even went for a 5 km run after cycling 99 km.\nCycling from Chishang Township to Taimali Township, Taitung County\nDistance: 99 km\nNot sure if the run on the previous day was a good idea, my legs were really sore on day 3. While Nat was feeling 100%, I was complaining at breakfast, not much excitement that morning. The weather forecast for our 3rd day biking in Taiwan wasn\u2019t good and we left the hotel under the rain.\nAll the beautiful rice fields we had seen before became average after cycling along the rice fields in Chishang. Opulent mountains on both sides of the valley, narrow roads and green rice fields as far as the eyes could see. Even with the rain, the place was outstanding. This was in the beginning of our journey that day and such a beautiful landscape put everybody in a good mood.\nOur journey was about to change sceneries, from valleys to rolling hills with sea view. The views were fantastic but there was a drawback, part of the road was under construction, so we needed to share our space with cars and big trucks while cycling up the big hills. The rain followed us almost the whole day, at least on our third day cycling in Taiwan we didn\u2019t suffer from the heat.\nCycling from Taimali Township to Checheng Township, Pingtung County\nDistance: 81 km\nThey saved the best for last. Our fourth day cycling the east coast of Taiwan was the most scenic, challenging and rewarding one. The first 30 km we cycled by rolling hills along the coast and for about 1 hour we could see a storm approaching the shores of Taiwan and once again the rain was our companion. No complains as the rain kept the heat away and the big waves crashing on the shore were beautiful. That was the scenic part of our cycling itinerary.\nThen the biggest challenge of our Taiwan\u2019s cycling trip started: 12km uphill to reach Souka Bike Station which was 460 meters above sea level. To be honest it went better than I expected, not easier but better. The countless curves and the traffic added an extra challenge to it. It took us about one hour to cover the distance and at Souka Bike Station there were dozens of bikers, a proof that Taiwan breathes cycling. Yes, that was the challenging part of the day.\nPhoto by Shin Yeo\nOur lunch was 11km downhill from Souka Bike Station. I was so happy to hear these 2 words: lunch and downhill. The 11km downhill were pleasant but required a lot of attention as the road was quite narrow and there was some traffic. The food at Maljipa Aboriginal Restaurant was outstanding, my favorite restaurant of the trip. They served aboriginal food prepared with fresh ingredients and served in a simple way , we loved it.\nIn the afternoon we cycled 28 km to reach Taiwan\u2019s west coast. We couldn\u2019t believe that our cycling trip in Taiwan was about to end. This was an easy and enjoyable ride, we chatted with the group, stopped for more photos and of course, for more iced coffee.\nOur final destination was the Checheng Fuan Temple where our support team was waiting for us. We returned the bikes, changed clothes, kissed goodbye and set off to Kaohsiung by bus. The convenience of having guides and a support car made our trip quite enjoyable and easier.\nWe not only survived the 4 days cycling in Taiwan\u2019s east coast, we also loved the experience. And to my surprise at no moment we thought of giving up, Nat and I cycled the whole 346 km route. This great feeling of accomplishment was the reward of the journey.\nWhen is the best time to cycle in Taiwan?\nThe weather in Taiwan can really influence your cycling trip. Between June and September expect high temperatures, rain, high humidity and chances of typhoons. Said that, avoid these months.\nFrom October to May the temperatures are more pleasant and it rains less. We traveled to Taiwan in the beginning of October and still got rain almost daily. I would suggest planning your Taiwan cycling tour between November and March, but be prepared for lower temperatures on the mountains.\nPhoto by Shin Yeo\nHow to rent a bike in Taiwan? How to choose a bike tour in Taiwan?\nOur cycling trip was organized by Taiwan Cycling Travel Association , they took care of everything, bikes, guides, support car, meals, accommodation\u2026 Our only concern was to cycle and enjoy the ride. Their Facebook page and website are in Chinese, but if you send them a message in English they will reply you back with all the information you need in English.\nRenting a bike for a cycling trip in Taiwan is fairly easy. There are many companies that either just rent out bikes or rent out \u00a0bikes and organize the trip for you. One of the resources to find bike rentals in Taiwan is the Taiwan Cycling Festival website . As we\u2019ve been \u00a0traveling full time for the past 4 years we always rely on \u00a0rental services, on my cycling trip in Spain , Ironman in Malaysia and the Ironman 70.3 Thailand we also rented bikes.\nWhat to pack for cycling in Taiwan?\nYour packing list will depend on your itinerary, on the season, if you are on a tour or by yourself. In all cases you will need a couple of jerseys, bike shorts, bike gloves, bike shoes, a helmet, sunglasses, sunscreen, mosquito repellent and a rain jacket. Regarding equipment don\u2019t forget headlights and taillights, squeeze water bottles, a cycling computer or smartwatch, a waterproof bag for your money/electronics, a toolkit and extra tubes & tires.\nA cycling trip in Taiwan will have memorable moments, so an action camera like GoPro comes in handy to record these moments. Use the waterproof case and mount it on the bike handlebar, on the helmet or even onto your chest for different angles.\nHow to travel to Taiwan and get around\nTaiwan is a travel destination that offers a wide range of experiences. Taipei is the perfect place for travelers who love the hustle and bustle of big cities, nightlife and food extravaganza [read our Guide to what to do in Taipei here]. Nature lovers can enjoy Taiwan\u2019s beautiful east coast with its wild beaches, hot springs and mountains. If you are seeking adventure go for some serious hiking and face the challenge of cycling in Taiwan.\nBut before planning your activities you need to plan your trip to Taiwan, so here goes some essential travel tips:\nTaiwan Tourist Visa\nYou might need a visa to Republic of China \u2013 Taiwan, before buying your flight ticket visit the Taiwan Bureau of Consular Affairs website to check if you are eligible for the free visa or if you need to apply in advance.\nHow to get to Taiwan:\nTaipei and Kaohsiung have busy international airports, use Skyscanner and Kiwi.com to search for the best flights to Taiwan.\nHow to get around Taiwan\nTaiwan is well connected with domestic flights, high-speed trains, conventional trains, buses and ferries to the islands close by. Depending on your itinerary, traveling in Taiwan can be super easy or a bit complicated due to the language barrier. Bear in mind that if you are in the big cities or if you purchase the transportation tickets online you might be able to do it in English. But you might struggle with the language if you need to buy a ticket in a small village bus station.\nTraveling along Taiwan\u2019s west coast is easy and fast, our trip from Kaohsiung to Taipei by high-speed train took less than 2 hours. The Taiwan High Speed Rail website has an English version and you can buy the tickets online. Book your ticket with at least 5 days in advance and you can get up to 35% discount.\nThe conventional trains are also a good option to travel in Taiwan, the Taiwan Railways website has a map of the routes and you can book the tickets online and in advance. If you want to travel to small towns by bus, or take a bus from a train station to a small town use Taiwan Trip . This is a governmental website that can help you find out the bus routes and which company operates the bus lines.\nWhere to stay in Taiwan:\nIn our Taiwan cycling itinerary we stayed in different hotels while biking the east coast. If you need recommendations for hotels in Taipei check out our 4 Days Taipei Itinerary , we have some great accommodation tips there. We spent one night in Kaohsiung city and there we stayed at the iconic 85 Sky Tower Hotel , the tallest building in the city.\nThe best websites to book hotels in Taiwan are:\nAgoda [they have the biggest selection of hotels in Asia]\nBooking.com [sometimes they have good deals with breakfast included]\nAirbnb [works really well in Taipei and big cities, click on the on Airbnb and get up to 30 USD credit to use on your next trip]\nHope we convinced you to cycle around Taiwan, it\u2019s not an easy trip but it\u2019s an amazing adventure.

Very interesting read. I am planning a cycle trip to do with a friend. Looking to ride the entire island over 9-10 days.

            "Save\nSave\nA rendering of Cape Town's Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art, which officially opens to the public next week Credit: Heatherwick Studio\nAs Cape Town 's Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art (MOCAA) - poised to be Africa's biggest contemporary art museum - \u00a0is unveiled today, our experts reveal the most spectacular museums to see around the world.\nWhich museums have we missed? Let us know in the comments below.\nNew York\n1. Museum of Modern Art\nKnown the world over as MoMA, the glassy Yoshio Taniguchi-designed Midtown building houses one of the most influential collections of modern art in the world. Van Gogh, C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Magritte, Picasso, Pollock and Warhol are all here. There is also performance art, architecture, design and a collection of 22,000 films, with frequent screenings and retrospectives.\n2. Metropolitan Museum of Art\nThe iconic New York museum is so enormous you\u2019ll be overwhelmed if you don\u2019t narrow your focus. Don\u2019t miss the Greek and Roman galleries on the first floor.\nDetails: metmuseum.org\n3. Guggenheim\nThe iconic, conch-shell shaped museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, has been drawing contemporary art lovers since it opened in 1959, its unique cylindrical shape a work of art in itself. Inside, visitors take in a constantly evolving collection of impressionist, post-impressionist, modern and contemporary art, including permanent pieces by Francis Bacon and Louise Bourgeois.\n- Douglas Rogers , Telegraph Travel\u2019s New York expert\nGuggenheim Credit: Alamy\n4. The Whitney Museum of American Art\nDesigned by Renzo Piano (the Italian architect who designed London's Shard, Europe's tallest builing), the museum found a new home next to the popular High Line elevated walkway in Manhattan\u2019s trendy Meatpacking District in 2015. Beyond its striking angular tiered exterior, you\u2019ll find equally fascinating collections of American contemporary art from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Mus\u00e9e du Louvre\nBoth a collection of art and a royal palace, including parts of the medieval castle concealed in the basement, the Louvre is mind-boggling in its scale and sheer wealth of treasures: from Classical sculpture, Egyptian relics and Mesopotamian antiquities to the unmissable galleries of Italian Renaissance paintings, Rembrandts and Rubens, medieval artefacts and French neoclassical and Romantic painting. The secret to mastering the Louvre is to combine a few key works you definitely want to see with the discoveries you make by wandering aimlessly.\n6. Mus\u00e9e Marmottan-Claude Monet\nThis Second Empire villa is one of Paris\u2019s secret gems, with its wonderful array of Empire furniture and the world\u2019s largest collection of works by Claude Monet, including several vibrantly coloured water-lily canvases, most of them donated by the artist\u2019s family.\n7. Mus\u00e9e National Rodin\nThe mansion where Rodin lived at the end of his life now contains an unrivalled collection of the sculptor\u2019s work, arranged around its rooms and beautiful garden. In finished works and countless studies for the great Balzac, the Burghers of Calais or the figures that swarm all over the Gates of Hell, you can trace how he revolutionised sculpture at the end of the 19th century.\nTelegraph logo\nTo watch The Telegraph's latest video content please visit youtube.com/telegraph\nRome\n8. Vatican Museums\nThese are otherwise known as \u201cthe rooms full of papally collected or commissioned art that you have to schlep through to get to the Sistine Chapel\u201d\u2013 but in fact there\u2019s plenty to enjoy along the way, from classical statues such as the Laocoon, to Pinturicchio\u2019s delightful Borgia Room frescoes.

Later generations made some worthwhile additions, such as Canova\u2019s risqu\u00e9 statue of Pauline Bonaparte.\n10. Design Museum\nLondon 's Design Museum reopened last November in its new \u00a383 million home in the former Commonwealth Institute in Kensington. \"Framed by trees on the edge of Holland Park, the interior of this 1962 modernist building with its distinctive copper hyperbolic paraboloid roof has been re-imagined by British architect John Pawson , who has transformed it into a minimalist temple of pale Dinesen Oak and white marble. Now with three times the amount of space, the museum, which first opened in 1989 in a former banana warehouse in Shad Thames, can stage a wider range of exhibitions and extend its learning programme \u2013 which includes designers in residence,\" described Bethan Ryder .\nLondon Design Museum Credit: Geoff Pugh Photography Ltd\nTelegraph Media Group Ltd\n11.

It is also a delightful rabbit warren of a place, with interlocking rooms on different levels crammed from floor to ceiling with pictures, prints, drawings, plaster casts, antique fragments, books and architectural models.\nA room at the Sir John Soane's Museum Credit: GARETH GARDNER WWW.GARETHGARDNER.COM/GARETH GARDNER\n12. The Victoria & Albert Museum\nThe London landmark, which recently received a new director ( former Labour MP and shadow education minister Tristram Hunt ), saw the largest architectural revamp of its 100-year history earlier this year, with a new courtyard entrance and underground gallery forming part of the Exhibition Road Building Project .\n\"The work of the London-based architect Amanda Levete, the new Sackler Gallery is a game-changing addition to the museum\u2019s arsenal of exhibition spaces. The existing temporary galleries are cramped, bisected by a corridor and suffer from the presence of a retro-fitted suspended ceiling,\" said the Telegraph's Ellis Woodman .\n\"The new courtyard capitalises on this change of atmosphere, bringing the street into the body of the museum. In achieving this Levete had to contend with the presence of a masonry screen which the building\u2019s original architect, Aston Webb, had installed on the street-line as a means of disguising the museum\u2019s boiler-house.\u00a0The most controversial aspect of her work has been the creation of a series of new openings in this listed structure, which are now fitted with gates of perforated aluminium.\"\nOthers not to be missed in London\u2026\nThe National Gallery ( nationalgallery.org.uk) opens until 9pm on Fridays, with occasional concerts and performances offering a charming, relaxed atmosphere. Both Tate Britain and Tate Modern ( tate.org.uk ) now do free Late at Tate nights every Friday until 10pm (Saturday as well at Tate Modern). The British Museum opens until 8.30pm on Friday nights ( britishmuseum.org ).\nMadrid\n13. Prado Museum\nOne of the greatest museums in the world, the Prado displays superb works by Spanish masters such as Vel\u00e1zquez, El Greco and Goya, but has wonderful Italian and Flemish collections, too, with paintings by Raphael, Titian and Tintoretto, Bosch and Rubens. There are usually at least two temporary exhibitions running as well.\n14. Reina Sof\u00eda Museum\nThe rehang of the permanent collections at the Reina Sof\u00eda modern art museum was completed in late 2010, with new displays on the fourth floor. Picasso\u2019s masterpiece Guernica attracts the biggest crowds, but don\u2019t miss the excellent works by Dal\u00ed, Mir\u00f3 and T\u00e0pies.\n15. Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum\nSuperlative collections of Western art from the 13th century to the present day, built up by the Thyssen-Bornemisza family and housed in a neo-classical palace. Highlights include paintings by D\u00fcrer, Titian, Raphael, Degas and Kandinsky, and there is usually at least one temporary exhibition running.\nThyssen-Bornemisza Museum Credit: \u00a9 Alex Segre / Alamy Stock Photo\nAmsterdam\n16. Rijksmuseum\nThe Dutch national treasure-house of art has at last re-opened after a decade-long renovation. Golden Age masterpieces by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals and so many more are on show alongside centuries\u2019 worth of fine furniture, Delftware, costume and jewellery. There\u2019s a superb Asian collection, and new aquisitions which bring the display up to the present day.\n17. Van Gogh Museum\nMore of the tortured artist\u2019s paintings and drawings are collected here than anywhere in the world, and the temporary exhibitions of associated works are usually inspired and engrossing.\nBarcelona\n18. MACBA\nThe Museu d\u2019Art Contemporani de Barcelona showcases the work of mostly Spanish and Catalan artists from the last 60 years, with some occasionally great temporary exhibitions. The building itself, a huge white monolith designed by Richard Meier, is worth the visit alone.\nMACBA\n19. Museu Picasso\nPicasso spent most of his formative years living in Barcelona, and the Museu Picasso documents his time here via sketches, paintings and ceramics produced during the early years of his career.\n20. The Hermitage, St Petersburg\nA day isn\u2019t really enough to do justice to the Hermitage\u2019s vast collection of art, which includes masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso and Rembrandt. Indeed, officials say it would take around 11 years to examine every single exhibit. Wander on the vast Palace Square beforehand.\nThe Hermitage Credit: Credit: studio204 / Alamy Stock Photo/studio204 / Alamy Stock Photo\n- Marc Bennetts , Telegraph Travel's St Petersburg expert\n21. Galleria degli Uffizi\nItaly\u2019s richest and most celebrated art gallery, is housed in what was originally built as the Medici Whitehall \u2013 the governing dynasty\u2019s administrative centre. It\u2019s difficult to pick out the cherries from an already cherry-picked selection (there\u2019s lots more in the vaults), but they would have to include Gentile da Fabriano\u2019s Adoration of the Magi, Botticelli\u2019s Primavera and Birth of Venus, Piero della Francesca\u2019s twin portraits of the Duke and Duchess of Urbino, and Michelangelo\u2019s Tondo Doni. Booking, however, is virtually essential.\n22. Palazzo Medici Riccardi\nMasaccio and Masolino\u2019s frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel are better known \u2013 and very lovely they are too, breathing the simple humanism of the early Renaissance. But it\u2019s well worth making time for the other great Florentine fresco cycle, decorating the private chapel of this mid-15th-century Medici palazzo: Benozzo Gozzoli\u2019s Journey of the Magi, a lively transposition of the Biblical story to the Florence of 1439.\n23. La Specola\nFlorence University\u2019s natural history museum houses a charmingly old-fashioned collection of botanical and zoological specimens, including a hippo that was given as a present to Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo. But the final rooms are what most visitors come for: a series of increasingly gruesome wax anatomical models, sculpted in eye-popping detail between 1775 and 1791 as teaching aids for trainee doctors. Smaller children may be traumatised, but difficult-to-please teens (and boys of all ages) should enjoy being grossed out \u2013 especially by the collection\u2019s coup de grace: three grisly wax tableaux of plague victims.\nLa Specola Credit: \u00a9 Naomi Bailey / Alamy Stock Photo/Naomi Bailey / Alamy Stock Photo\nAthens\n24. New Acropolis Museum\nInaugurated in June 2009, this light, airy glass-and-concrete building was designed by Swiss architect Bernard Tschumi. Archaic and classical finds from the Acropolis site are displayed here \u2013 proud statues of the ancients and life-like stone carvings of animals. The top floor is devoted to the marble frieze that once ran around the top of the Parthenon. About half of the pieces are originals, while the remainder are white plaster copies. The missing pieces were removed by Lord Elgin in 1801 and are now in the British Museum in London. The Greeks have wanted them back for decades, and hope that this blatant presentation will finally convince the British to return them.\nThe New Acropolis Museum Credit: Yorgos Gaitis - Fotolia\n25. Benaki Museum\nHoused in a neo-classical building with a lovely roof-terrace cafe, this museum traces Greek art right up the 20th century. Sculpture, ceramics, jewellery, paintings, furniture and costumes are on display, but top pieces include the Thessaly Treasure (a hoard of gold filigree jewellery set with precious stones, dating from the second century BC), two early paintings by El Greco, and the reconstruction of two 18th-century, wood-panelled, Ottoman-inspired living rooms.\nBrussels\n26. Mus\u00e9e de la Ville de Bruxelles\nOpposite it is the neo-Gothic Maison du Roi, now home to the Mus\u00e9e de la Ville de Bruxelles (Museum of the City of Brussels); this includes the collection of diminutive costumes made for Brussels\u2019s famous mascot, the Manneken Pis \u2013 the statue of the little boy doing what his name suggests, which lies a short walk away, to the west.\n27. Mus\u00e9es Royaux de Beaux Arts\nWithout making a song and dance about it, this collection is a showcase for the brilliance of Belgian art. It begins with the Flemish \u201cprimitives\u201d, the late-medieval pioneers in oil painting, celebrated for their intense attention to detail. It then leads through Pieter Brueghel the Elder and the Younger to Rubens, master of dramatic composition, and Antony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens.\nIn the late 19th century, Belgium was a centre of Symbolism, producing work of haunting beauty and compelling weirdness. And then came the great surrealist Ren\u00e9 Magritte, to whom a whole wing of the museum has recently been devoted. Other great names in the history of art are represented too, but it is the Belgians who make the deepest impression.\n28. Mus\u00e9e des Instruments de Musique (MIM)\nWith a collection of some 6,000 historical musical instruments to choose from, MIM can put on a show of astonishing range and quality. Three other factors work in its favour: the museum is housed in a beautifully renovated Art Nouveau building, formerly a department store; headphones bring the musical instruments alive; and the view over Brussels from the rooftop restaurant is unparalleled.\nThis Wednesday 01 march, the mim is accessible free of charge from 1 p.m.! pic.twitter.com/tCWj2SZOb7\n29. Mus\u00e9e du Cinquantenaire\nThis is Belgium\u2019s hoard of international antiquities \u2013 by far the largest of a collection of heritage museums that (like the Mus\u00e9e des Instruments de Musique) come under the umbrella of the Mus\u00e9es Royaux d\u2019Art et d\u2019Histoire. There are great chunks of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome here.\nBut there is also plenty of local talent, including medieval Brussels tapestries, retables (sculptured altarpieces), and Art Nouveau objets d\u2019art. They are housed in buildings originally designed for the 1880 international exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of Belgian nationhood. The surrounding Parc Cinquantenaire also has a military museum, and an impressive collection of antique cars called Autoworld.\n- Antony Mason , Brussels expert\n30. Museum Island, Berlin\nThe Unesco heritage Museum Island comprises five conveniently adjacent museums, all located on an accessible \u201cisland\u201d along the river Spree. Each museum is a destination in its own right and deserves at least half a day to explore. The Pergamon Museum has vast treasures from the Ancient Near East and Islamic art, though the Pergamon Altar, north wing and gallery of Hellenistic art are closed to the public until 2019 due to refurbishment; the Neues Museum holds Egyptian, prehistoric and classical treats, while the Bode Museum has an outstanding sculpture collection. Combination tickets are available for all five museums.\nMuseum Island in Berlin Credit: Noppasinw - Fotolia\n- Paul Sullivan , Telegraph Travel\u2019s Berlin expert\n31. Getty Villa + Getty Center, Los Angeles\nThe Getty Museum is spread over two lavish campuses. The most extravagant, the original Getty Villa in Malibu, is a modern recreation of a First century Roman villa built by oil tycoon J Paul Getty. The villa houses a world-class collection of Greek, Roman and Etruscan antiquities. The Getty Center, which opened on a hillside in Brentwood in 1997 and cost $1.3 billion, looks more like a giant white pharmaceutical plant and houses a world class collection of American and European photographs, European art and furniture.\nGetty Villa Credit: Getty\n32. Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Seoul\nThe Zaha Hadid -designed futuristic structure, featuring a curvaceous metallic fa\u00e7ade that is lit up by night, is one of Seoul \u2019s greatest modern landmarks. The grounds of the multicultural complex houses a number of art and design venues including a design museum and other gallery/exhibition spaces, design shops, plus an eco-friendly park.\nDongdaemun Design Plaza Credit: \u00a9 nattanai chimjanon / Alamy Stock Photo/nattanai chimjanon / Alamy Stock Photo\n33.\u00a0Museo Atl\u00e1ntico, Lanzarote\nMuseo Atl\u00e1ntico, an underwater collection of more than 300 sculptural works by British artist Jason deCaires Taylor, opened to the public earlier this year. The installations can be found 14 metres beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean in Bah\u00eda de Las Coloradas (Coloradas Bay), off the south coast of Lanzarote. The site spans an area of 2,500 square metres, and can be explored by scuba divers or from glass-bottomed boats.\nTelegraph logo\nTo watch The Telegraph's latest video content please visit youtube.com/telegraph\n34. Museum of Broken Relationships, Croatia\nDescribed as a \u201cgenuinely touching window on the human soul\u201d by Telegraph Travel\u2019s Chris Leadbeater, the brilliant attraction showcases a bizarre collection of objects connected to romances that are no more. Subtly illustrating the tragic-comedy that is love, it is now one of Zagreb\u2019s most visited museums.\n35. ArtScience Museum, Singapore\nBuilt as part of Singapore 's Marina Bay Sands Resort, the world\u2019s first art and science museum features an unusual lotus-shaped structure. While it hosts several leading travelling exhibitions from around the world, its new permanent exhibition Future World showcases 16 incredible art installations and is said to be the country\u2019s \u201clargest interactive digital playground,\u201d exploring themes including \u201cnature, town, park and space\u201d.\n\u201cAll those moments will be lost in time\u2026like tears in rain\u201d\u2013Blade Runner.

Louisiana Museum of Art, Denmark\nSet about 25 miles north of Copenhagen and with views of Sweden across the Sound, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art is one of Denmark\u2019s most lauded cultural attractions.\nThe Giacometti Gallery Credit: Louisiana Museum of Modern Art/Kim Hansen\n\u201cAs a museum we stand apart in the sense that there is no one thing you have to see. Louisiana at heart is a place where you go to be. That said, one should pause to reflect in The Giacometti Gallery. The collection of Giacomettis, the proportions of the gallery and the view of the lake form an artistic totality \u2013 majestic, serene and breathtaking. The Sculpture Park with its Henry Moores and Alexander Calders and view of the sea cannot be missed either,\" Erik T\u00f8jner, the museum\u2019s director, told Telegraph Luxury .\n37.\u00a0Shanghai Museum, China\nChina's vast cultural heritage is celebrated at the exceptional Shanghai Museum, free to visit and one of the metropolis's most edifying and interesting attractions. A treasure trove of Chinese art, its galleries run the gauntlet from ancient bronze to Chinese calligraphy to Ming furniture - a must for fans of Chinese craftsmanship or interior-design acolytes keen for ideas on how to beautifully decorate their homes.\nThe Shanghai Museum Credit: Getty\nBildmuseet Credit: Upphovsperson = Montage: White Arkitekter\n38. Bildmuseet, Sweden\nThe contemporary art and design museum in the Swedish city of Ume\u00e5, the former residence of Stieg Larsson (author of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and others from the Millennium book/film trilogy) and European Capital of Culture for 2014, was named as one of the most beautiful university art galleries in the world following a redesign in 2012. The building itself is a thoughtful work of art, made with a fa\u00e7ade of Siberian larch wood panelling, which will fade to a silver grey colour in a few years\u2019 time, staggered with randomly-placed windows. Its stark white interior is warmed by the natural light piercing through its windows which offer scenic views from the museum\u2019s riverside location.\n39. Chichu Art Museum, Japan\nJapan's 'art island', tiny Naoshima boasts a disproportionate number of world-class installations, unexpected cultural distractions and world-class museums. In the latter category, Chichu Art Museum is built mostly underground - so as not to sully the island's largely unblemished beauty - and features vast exhibition spaces largely built to complement the artworks, by the likes of Monet and Walter De Maria, which they now house.\nChichu Art Museum\n40. \u00a0Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino, Santiago, Chile\nThe Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino is one of the world\u2019s best museums for ancient Central and South American artefacts. Exhibits range from a collection of 7ft-high chemamull (wooden person) grave markers to Taino spatulas, the latter used to induce vomit ahead of religious ceremonies.\n41.\u00a0National Palace Museum, Taipei\nA showcase for over 600,000 artefacts that were transported for safekeeping from mainland China to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War, Taipei's National Palace Museum is a sprawling repository for some of the most exquisite Chinese artworks and crafts in existence. Its collection holds exceptional collections of jades, ceramics and lacquerwares, alongside more unexpected exhibits - look out for a cabbage made of coloured glass (beloved by the Taiwanese) and an intricately detailed, miniature boat, carved from an olive pit.\n42. Zeitz MOCAA, Cape Town\nOfficially opening to the public on September 22, Cape Town's Zeitz MOCAA is set to become Africa's most important cultural attraction . Established through a partnership between the V&A Waterfront and former Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz, the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary African Art will showcase diverse modern art from throughout the continent; it is the first major museum of its kind in all of Africa. Visitors can also stay at Cape Town's Silo Hotel , which stands atop some of the complex.\n- John O'Ceallaigh, Telegraph Travel's Luxury Travel editor\nA rendering of the interior of the MOCAA Credit: Heatherwick Studio\nWhich museums have we missed?

            "Singapore 178897\n6332 3659\nWell organized overview of the history of Singapore.  Nice use of senses in this museum.  Ticket purchase online or in person.  Educational for kids and adults.  Rated G PG version of the war.  \n\nNon-residents/visitors $23 admission.  Steep discount  for Singaporeans.\nI am a sucker for museums, especially \"National\" museums representing a country.  The NMS is located in a prestigious English parliamentary type building with large columns, sweeping staircases, wide corridors and numerous wings.\n\nBottom floor entry has a Singapore History exhibit which talks of the Native People, early Chinese / Indian / Malay traders, Dutch and British colonizers, Japanese Imperialists, and eventual separation from  Malaysia.  The latter with film clips discussing the hard decision on the separation from Malaysia.  Quite poignant.  Artifacts throughout the exhibit including a Japanese WWII replica tank.\n\nSecond floor has an animation exhibition in the round and also streaming along a winding corridor depicting animals, trees, flowers, etc.. impressive to kids and adults.\n\nOther exhibits on fashion, women's changing roles in Singaporean society, the benefits of government housing, changes between 70s and 80s Singapore.\n\nYou can easily spend 3+ hours here!  Cost is $15 Singapore Dollars per Adult.\nA great place to learn about the history of Singapore. Highly recommend taking the guided tour at 11 AM. Tixs are $12 per person SD. Our docent was a retired pilot who spent 1 hr 40 mins taking the group thru the gallery.  He was excellent and knew his history well and passionate about sharing his knowledge. \nThe museum is very modern and pretty. Several things to see besides Singapore's past history, also modern growth since the 1920s onward in the upstairs area and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers. I found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty. \n\nThere is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of Singapore including the Japanese occupation during WW2 and the suffering endured by the Singaporeans. When we were in Japan 2 yrs ago, the museum in Japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered.  No mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies.  \n\nThere is a tiny cafe on the bottom floor if you are in need of rest or nourishment.\nI believe the National Museum of Singapore should be the first thing everyone visits during their travels to this beautiful country \n\nThis museums shows you the history behind this amazing metropolis and all the hardships they've been going through before and after their independence in 1965. This museum will definitely give you a greater understanding and appreciation of how this country works and how they've been so successful. During my visit I got to enjoy a special exhibit in World War II, which was very eye-opening. Growing up in Mexico and then moving to the United States, I only learned what happened in Europe and North America during WWII, and it was somewhat scary to learned everything the Japanese empire did in this side of the world during the same time period. I couldn't believe we were never taught any of this at school. \n\nThank you National Museum of Singapore for teaching me something new and opening my eyes to new possibilities and world views.\nAs far as national museums go, this appears to need a major overhaul. Completely skipping the Dutch influence on Singapore's history is a major faux-pas especially considering how Singapore wants to be seen as inclusive. They apparently had no problem setting up a comprehensive display on the brutal Japanese occupation and that was only three years. For the admission price the facility leaves a lot to be desired though the effort made is certainly commendable.\nGreat museum, especially if you want to take advantage of their air conditioning. \n\nLot's of history and you get to finally learn all the western influences had on Singapore. And there are exhibits that talks about Singapore during World War 2 and their independence several years later.\nAny nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn  about their history and culture. A museum like \"The National Museum Of Singapore\" would be the best example. Underneath the glitzy hotels, and swanky retails.  lies a more profound Singapore. A history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land.  Before the arrival of the westerners,  it was more \"Man Vs Wild\" than \"Crazy Rich Asians \".  \n    It starts off with the indigenous people aka the Malays and their methods of cultivating land. Then the arrival of Chinese mainly from provinces of Hainan and other parts of south China who arrived as early as the 11th century. Both groups worked along side each other in the jungles. Later traders from India mostly from Tamil arrived. Museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side.\n    Later segments in museums depicts the arrival of Europeans and especially Stamford Raffle the founder of modern Singapore.  It focus the control of Singapore under the British East India Company. It was still a colony with current day Malaysia known as British Malaya  until 1962 when it joined Malaysia as a soverign nation. \n     Rest of the museum focused on its succession from Malaysia in 1965 and the formation of todays Singapore which is the modern metropolis of success.\nGreat place to learn about Singapore's history, especially the guided tour by a passionate volunteer guide. A lot of coverage on life during and post WW2. Lunch options are rather limited and overpriced though.\nEntrance is $15 for regular adult and $10 for senior citizens,however it's free for all local residents.\nNice way to soak into the history and culture of Singapore. Place is huge and immaculate. Wanted to see the Janice Wong exhibit,however it was closed for a private function.\nI was visiting Singapore for a few days, and as someone who is used to dry heat, the Singapore humidity is a lot to handle, especially midday. As such, it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat. One of the things we did was to check out the National Museum.\n\nAs the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to all things Singaporean. The exhibits detail Singapore's history throughout the years, and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages (e.g.: pop culture, fashion, plants). Even if you're not a huge history buff, I think that you can definitely find something interesting.\n\nOne of my favorite exhibits was the special Story of the Forest exhibit created by teamLab. It has digital images projected onto the walls. Maybe not everyone would find it interesting, but I happen to be a fan of teamLab's work!\n\nAlthough all the descriptions are provided in English, they did have handouts in 3 other languages for non-English speakers. This was useful for my mom, as she reads and understands Chinese a lot more easily than English.\n\nOverall this is not a bad way to escape the heat for a few hours. You'll be able to see some interesting things, while learning more about the development of Singapore as a country.\nThe building is flashy and the interior itself is worth seeing. If you're a Singaporean PR, you can get in for free, otherwise, it's not too much to pay either.\n\nI give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries. Yes, granted that people of Singapore did come from many other places and they're all immigrants so to speak but there aren't many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the Great Britain. \n\nMuseum-wise, it's ok, bordering on the must see, because what else do you do in Singapore after eating laksa and chilli crab, right? (Kidding), but Chinese Heritage Museum gives you so much more story than this place.\nThe previous time I was in Singapore I gave this place a miss, namely because I thought that it was basically a natural history museum. However, as it turned out, it had nothing to do with natural history and eveything to do with the city of Singapore. Basically the museum looks at the whole period of the city from the prehistoric eras, through colonialism, World War II, and the birth of the Island republic (and the problems that arose therein). It is interesting, but really only if you are hugely keen on knowing more about the city itself, or are bored and looking for something to do. As for me, I found it interesting, but not hugely fantastic.\nIt's always a good thing to learn a thing or two about a new place when traveling.  We visited the museum to learn more about Singapore's past, present, and future. I loved the exhibits and the artistry the museum offers!  Great for the whole family.  \n\nDid I mention that there's AC and escalators?!\nA good museum for Singapore's history.  But I went here after going to the Asian Civilisations Museum, so it seemed a bit repetitive, although cheaper.  The second floor of the museum is Singapore through the decades.  That portion was a bit fun, especially the 1950-60s room.  Lots of reminiscing for my mom.  I guess the culture over in Hong Kong wasn't too different during that decade.\nIf you're rich, dine at Flutes restaurant in the museum.\nIf you're middle-class, eat at Food For Thought in the museum.\nIf you're on a budget, makan at Food Republic across the street.\nIf you're poor, chow down at Koufu Food Court in the basement of SMU. Cross the street and take an escalator down.\n\nMuseums make visitors hungry!\nAbsolutely phenomenal. The NMS is one of the best museums I have every visited.  Beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out. For the main admission fee of $15 SGD, you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on Singapore history. There is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for, which I opted not to pay extra for.  The art exhibits are okay (full disclosure I only had time to check out two), but in my opinion, the stars of the show are the history exhibits. There is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of Singapore's history starting from pre-European contact through the present. I felt like I really learned a lot about the different eras in Singapore's history and there were plenty of cool artifacts, along with mNy different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls. The past 100 years of Singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building. This was split into four parts, each in a different room: pre-war colonial era (through 1930s), Japanese occupation (1940s), post war / independence (1950s and 60s) and the beginning of the modern era (1970s and 80s). Each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted. My favorite was the last one covering through the 1980s. It was quite elaborate, with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original Singapore Stadium. The screen changed every 30 seconds or so to show a new scene. There was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat. Brilliant.  Visit this museum. If you don't, you're really missing out.\nI think this is a good way to get a little picture of how Singapore has evolved over the years - there are several galleries that cover sort of one or two decade stretches of time, and those are really interesting and presented in very engaging and creative ways. The main Singapore history gallery has information dating back to about 800AD and forward to the economic powerhouse that it's become - careful to point out that Singapore existed before Raffles landed and \"started\" it. Plus for the WWII buff in me, the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under Japanese occupation. I wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail - I'm the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff, but all in all, worth visiting. More expensive than the nearby Asian Civilizations Museum, but definitely covering very different content.\nA born and raised Singaporean, my first trip here was long overdue. This is a world-class museum of the history of Singapore, with plenty of interactive audio and video exhibits to tell Singapore's story from its roots as a sleepy fishing village to bustling global city-state. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my visit and spent 5-6 hours here by myself. I explored every nook and cranny and there was always something exciting to see. \n\nOne of the highlights of my trip were the Glass Rotunda, which houses teamlab's Magic Forest interactive exhibit. If you're familiar with teamlab you'll know they make the most entrancing, magical interactive exhibits. When you first enter you'll be captivated by a large room with magical plants projected on the walls swirling around as ambient background music enveloping you. Amazing. There's also a larger room like that with comfy bean bags that you can lounge in and just soak in the atmosphere. I loved it so much I visited twice. \n\nAnother highlight was the exhibit Life in Singapore: Surviving Syonan. It documents life under the Japanese Occupation and was completely fascinating. I've heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand. There is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times. This exhibit gave me great insight into the Japanese occupation and I loved every moment. \n\nThe main exhibit, History of Singapore, is large, comprehensive, and beautiful. It covers Singapore's entire history and I believe Singaporeans and tourists alike should visit! \n\nAdmission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents is free - just flash your IC - and it's only $10-18 for non-residents. If you're on a budget, skip the special exhibit that's going on right now (what is not visible is not invisible) because it's not really worth $8. Its the kind of art that is only art because of what the artist writes about it. \n\nThere are two cafes and a restaurant to choose from when you get hungry. Clean and beautiful bathrooms are everywhere. The architecture of the museum is both traditional and modern and will take your breath away. \n\nOverall an amazing museum. It makes me proud of my homeland and to be Singaporean.\nGood place for a quick rundown on Singapore's history.\nGround floor is currently about the late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was instrumental in making Singapore what it is today. \nThe lower floors are about Singapore's history: how the major ethnic groups (Chinese, Malays, Indians) came here, and what they did.\nAlso, some colonial history, and about the Japanese occupation of Singapore during the 2nd World War.\n\nI found the Revere Bell (see pic) interesting: I bet most Americans do not know that American Patriot Paul Revere's daughter gave this bell (made in Boston) to a church in Singapore in 1843.\nReally nice building where we spent some time waiting for our battle box tour. Learned about the history of Singapore which I didn't know much about. Really liked the sculpture or is it a display of all the pots and pans making a huge sphere in the entrance. I didn't have time to see the rest of the museum but apparently goes into detail for specific eras in history. I enjoy historical museums a lot more than art museums so this was good. I think entrance was about 7? 10? But worth it to get outta the rain.\nReview Highlights\n\u201cThe NMS is located in a prestigious English parliamentary type building with large columns, sweeping staircases, wide corridors and numerous wings.\u201d in 3 reviews\n\u201cAlso, some colonial history, and about the Japanese occupation of Singapore during the 2nd World War.\u201d in 5 reviews\n\u201cIt covers Singapore's entire history and I believe Singaporeans and tourists alike should visit!\u201d in 3 reviews\nLocation & Hours\nRecommended Reviews\nYour trust is our top concern, so businesses can't pay to alter or remove their reviews.

Highly recommend taking the guided tour at 11 AM. Tixs are $12 per person SD. Our docent was a retired pilot who spent 1 hr 40 mins taking the group thru the gallery. \u00a0He was excellent and knew his history well and passionate about sharing his knowledge.\nThe museum is very modern and pretty. Several things to see besides Singapore's past history, also modern growth since the 1920s onward in the upstairs area and an animated 3D area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals, habitat, and flowers. I found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty.\nThere is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of Singapore including the Japanese occupation during WW2 and the suffering endured by the Singaporeans. When we were in Japan 2 yrs ago, the museum in Japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered. \u00a0No mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies.\nThere is a tiny cafe on the bottom floor if you are in need of rest or nourishment.\nI believe the National Museum of Singapore should be the first thing everyone visits during their travels to this beautiful country\nThis museums shows you the history behind this amazing metropolis and all the hardships they've been going through before and after their independence in 1965. This museum will definitely give you a greater understanding and appreciation of how this country works and how they've been so successful. During my visit I got to enjoy a special exhibit in World War II, which was very eye-opening. Growing up in Mexico and then moving to the United States, I only learned what happened in Europe and North America during WWII, and it was somewhat scary to learned everything the Japanese empire did in this side of the world during the same time period. I couldn't believe we were never taught any of this at school.\nThank you National Museum of Singapore for teaching me something new and opening my eyes to new possibilities and world views.\nUseful 8\nFunny 2\nCool 5\nVincent V.\n1 check-in\nAs far as national museums go, this appears to need a major overhaul. Completely skipping the Dutch influence on Singapore's history is a major faux-pas especially considering how Singapore wants to be seen as inclusive. They apparently had no problem setting up a comprehensive display on the brutal Japanese occupation and that was only three years. For the admission price the facility leaves a lot to be desired though the effort made is certainly commendable.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nGreat museum, especially if you want to take advantage of their air conditioning.\nLot's of history and you get to finally learn all the western influences had on Singapore. And there are exhibits that talks about Singapore during World War 2 and their independence several years later.\nUseful 2\nFunny 2\nCool 2\nYoung K.\n2/10/2019\nAny nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn \u00a0about their history and culture. A museum like \"The National Museum Of Singapore\" would be the best example. Underneath the glitzy hotels, and swanky retails. \u00a0lies a more profound Singapore. A history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land. \u00a0Before the arrival of the westerners, \u00a0it was more \"Man Vs Wild\" than \"Crazy Rich Asians \".\nIt starts off with the indigenous people aka the Malays and their methods of cultivating land. Then the arrival of Chinese mainly from provinces of Hainan and other parts of south China who arrived as early as the 11th century. Both groups worked along side each other in the jungles. Later traders from India mostly from Tamil arrived. Museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side.\nLater segments in museums depicts the arrival of Europeans and especially Stamford Raffle the founder of modern Singapore. \u00a0It focus the control of Singapore under the British East India Company. It was still a colony with current day Malaysia known as British Malaya \u00a0until 1962 when it joined Malaysia as a soverign nation.\nRest of the museum focused on its succession from Malaysia in 1965 and the formation of todays Singapore which is the modern metropolis of success.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nGreat place to learn about Singapore's history, especially the guided tour by a passionate volunteer guide. A lot of coverage on life during and post WW2. Lunch options are rather limited and overpriced though.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nEntrance is $15 for regular adult and $10 for senior citizens,however it's free for all local residents.\nNice way to soak into the history and culture of Singapore. Place is huge and immaculate. Wanted to see the Janice Wong exhibit,however it was closed for a private function.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nI was visiting Singapore for a few days, and as someone who is used to dry heat, the Singapore humidity is a lot to handle, especially midday. As such, it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat. One of the things we did was to check out the National Museum.\nAs the name suggests, this is a museum dedicated to all things Singaporean. The exhibits detail Singapore's history throughout the years, and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages (e.g.: pop culture, fashion, plants). Even if you're not a huge history buff, I think that you can definitely find something interesting.\nOne of my favorite exhibits was the special Story of the Forest exhibit created by teamLab. It has digital images projected onto the walls. Maybe not everyone would find it interesting, but I happen to be a fan of teamLab's work!\nAlthough all the descriptions are provided in English, they did have handouts in 3 other languages for non-English speakers. This was useful for my mom, as she reads and understands Chinese a lot more easily than English.\nOverall this is not a bad way to escape the heat for a few hours. You'll be able to see some interesting things, while learning more about the development of Singapore as a country.\nThe building is flashy and the interior itself is worth seeing. If you're a Singaporean PR, you can get in for free, otherwise, it's not too much to pay either.\nI give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries. Yes, granted that people of Singapore did come from many other places and they're all immigrants so to speak but there aren't many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the Great Britain.\nMuseum-wise, it's ok, bordering on the must see, because what else do you do in Singapore after eating laksa and chilli crab, right? (Kidding), but Chinese Heritage Museum gives you so much more story than this place.\nUseful 1\n1 check-in\nIt's always a good thing to learn a thing or two about a new place when traveling. \u00a0We visited the museum to learn more about Singapore's past, present, and future. I loved the exhibits and the artistry the museum offers! \u00a0Great for the whole family.\nDid I mention that there's AC and escalators?!\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nA good museum for Singapore's history. \u00a0But I went here after going to the Asian Civilisations Museum, so it seemed a bit repetitive, although cheaper. \u00a0The second floor of the museum is Singapore through the decades. \u00a0That portion was a bit fun, especially the 1950-60s room. \u00a0Lots of reminiscing for my mom. \u00a0I guess the culture over in Hong Kong wasn't too different during that decade.\nIf you're middle-class, eat at Food For Thought in the museum.\nIf you're on a budget, makan at Food Republic across the street.\nIf you're poor, chow down at Koufu Food Court in the basement of SMU. Cross the street and take an escalator down.\nMuseums make visitors hungry!\n25/11/2018\nAbsolutely phenomenal. The NMS is one of the best museums I have every visited. \u00a0Beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out. For the main admission fee of $15 SGD, you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on Singapore history. There is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for, which I opted not to pay extra for. \u00a0The art exhibits are okay (full disclosure I only had time to check out two), but in my opinion, the stars of the show are the history exhibits. There is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of Singapore's history starting from pre-European contact through the present. I felt like I really learned a lot about the different eras in Singapore's history and there were plenty of cool artifacts, along with mNy different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls. The past 100 years of Singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building. This was split into four parts, each in a different room: pre-war colonial era (through 1930s), Japanese occupation (1940s), post war / independence (1950s and 60s) and the beginning of the modern era (1970s and 80s). Each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted. My favorite was the last one covering through the 1980s. It was quite elaborate, with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original Singapore Stadium. The screen changed every 30 seconds or so to show a new scene. There was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat. Brilliant. \u00a0Visit this museum. If you don't, you're really missing out.\nUseful 1\n1 check-in\nI think this is a good way to get a little picture of how Singapore has evolved over the years - there are several galleries that cover sort of one or two decade stretches of time, and those are really interesting and presented in very engaging and creative ways. The main Singapore history gallery has information dating back to about 800AD and forward to the economic powerhouse that it's become - careful to point out that Singapore existed before Raffles landed and \"started\" it. Plus for the WWII buff in me, the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under Japanese occupation. I wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail - I'm the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff, but all in all, worth visiting. More expensive than the nearby Asian Civilizations Museum, but definitely covering very different content.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n1 check-in\nA born and raised Singaporean, my first trip here was long overdue.

            "0.0\nEntrance Fees:\nIndividual Admission\nAdult $8.00\nConcession* $4.00\n*Full time students and senior citizens aged 60 years and above (non-Singaporeans only, please present ID for verification).\nPrice Range\n< $10\nThe Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is the first museum in the region to present a broad yet integrated perspective of pan-Asian cultures and civilisations. It focuses on a diverse range of cultures brought to Singapore by founding immigrants over the last 200 years.\n5.0\nWhen I was younger, my mother used to bring me to different museums every fortnight. My favorite was always the Asian Civilisations Museum as the vibrant colours and exotic exhibitions never failed to fascinate my little eyes!\nOne particular exhibition that stood out to me as a child was the Southeast Asian exhibition as there were numerous interactive spaces that brought the past to life. An example was a component that allowed one to try out making music on the Javanese Gamelan. With its tinkling and mythical sound, I often felt like I was a character in a folklore!\nDue to its emphasis on Asian culture, the museum was relatable and I honestly learnt a lot about other cultures from my visits. Asian Civilisations Museum might just have been the start of my love for history.\nC\nWindow to the World\n4.5\nBy far my favourite museum in Singapore, every visit is exhausting but totally worth it. The featured exhibits are constantly changing so it doesn\u2019t really get boring.\nIt might not be interactive or visually exciting compared to the newer museums, but the exhibits are engaging in their own understated way. Chock-full of artefacts, there\u2019s something for everyone - walk into the Singapore River gallery for a glimpse of our past, or wander among religious sculptures in the South Asia gallery. I've spent entire days at featured exhibits just looking at the descriptions of the artefacts - if you don't have the time to spare, I suggest just skimming through the exhibits till you find something that catches your eye.\nIt definitely takes time to get to know the museum. I doubt anyone could fully appreciate all the galleries in one visit! A personal favourite is the Southeast Asia gallery. The artefacts tell stories of each unique culture in Southeast Asia and learning about others\u2019 way of life is just very exciting!\nAL\nAmanda Lee\nSingapore's best\n4.5\nFor my money, this is Singapore\u2019s finest Museum, though the National Museum gives it a run for its money. It is what it says: a museum showcasing, through regularly changing exhibitions, the rich cultures of Asia that make up today\u2019s Singapore. Set in a magnificent old Colonial Government Building, it sets out to be the best museum in Asia and to my mind it achieves this.\nThe constantly changing exhibitions mean that you can visit every couple of months and still learn something. Rather than take you through a chronological history, it focuses on themes. Interactive you want? It is here. Touch and feel? It is here. Information, guides and explanations? Here in abundance.\nWhat a wonderful place.\nlansell taudevin\nNice ambience\n4.0\nThe current exhibition at Asian Civilization Museum is Enlightened Ways: The Many Streams of Buddhist Art in Thailand. I was just there this afternoon. I heard in the Parliament that museum will be free for Singaporeans but when I was there, I was told this would only take effect in May. Anyway, the admission fees was only $8 for adults and those with Passion card will have a discount. Singapore students and senior citizens also get free admissions.\nIt was my first visit to ACM so I was not able to tell which was the special exhibition and which was the regular exhibits. I found the whole ambiance there to be very pleasing. The space was quite spacious and the lighting was very soothing. It was not very bright but the exhibits were properly lighted and the accompanying texts would also have sufficient lighting for reading. There were also some touch screens and multimedia displays to make the exhibition more interactive.\nW\nPlace to relax\nMarch 16, 2013\n3.5\nAs an art student, it is a must to visit all art museums and this place is no exception. The history inside the museum can be seen from the building as well as looked battered from the outside. I was attracted to it as they had activities and they do update their act pieces every now and then.\nAt the time i visited, the theme was Africa and they had free entry. Unlike usual days, it was bustling with people and i got to witness african dances, face painting and scupltures and painting that were imported from africa. I had fun and spend around 2 hours in the museum which is longer than the usual time i spent at other art museums.\nThere are about 4 levels if i remembered correctly and it takes time to explore the museum. There were even kids running about because of the fun activities they held. Museums should host more of these kind of activities to attract different crowds of people.\nOptional Information:\nAlicia Devon Koo\nA Cultural Adventure through Space and Time\nMarch 02, 2013\n5.0\nMy earliest memories of the Asian Civilisations Museum were of clay figurines of Chinese coolies in a dimly lit room back at its former building at Armenian Street.\nAfter revisiting the place years later at its new location at Empress Place, I must say that the museum has indeed come a long way. Besides the colourfully diverse range of Asian cultures in the various museum galleries and the richness of cultural artefacts presented, I was delighted to find several interactive exhibits that brought history to life. A personal favourite of mine was Gallery 4a of the Southeast Asia gallery, which brought us into an almost transcendent world of Southeast Asian rituals and performing arts. The excellent layout of the various galleries also made journeying through them a seamless adventure through time and space, rather than a mere static display.\nAll in all, I would highly recommend a visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum for a most unique historical and cultural adventure.\nSH\nSusanna Hioe\nRoots of this island\n4.0\nWas pretty alarmed by the fact that I had not been to the Asian Civilization Museum. So, my American fianc\u00e9 and I made our way down to it one rainy wednesday. I, as an avid traveller, thoroughly enjoy museums as it provides a one stop location for cultural education. Hence my excitement at finding one in Singapore that I had not actually been to.\nThe first thing that I noted about the place was how cold the air conditioning was. The second was the post modern, traditional decor of the museum. The museum had a large collection of statues and objects of cultural relevance, and I must admit, it did invoke a sense of nostalgia and pride in my being. The exhibits were also extremely creative and interactive, ranging from touch screen guides to audio exhibits. If you're engaged to a foreigner as I am, you may want to take this chance to educate your fianc\u00e9 as to why we act the way we do. Because even though some of us may have forgotten our roots, our roots never cease to remember us.\nS\nMost Interesting and Educational Museum in Singapore\nFebruary 16, 2013\n5.0\nThe Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) is my favourite museum in Singapore. It is a small museum housing a small collection of Asian artefacts, but the curators have arranged the artefacts so well, that it is very easy for visitors to understand the stories behind the artefacts. Unlike some bigger museums (in other countries) that only provide the name, date and provenance of the artefacts, ACM includes more pertinent facts about them in text, image and video formats, which help to make the experience more educational and interesting.\nThe building has 3 storeys with 11 galleries, housing artefacts from both permanent and special exhibitions. Some high-profile special exhibitions were: Congo River, Terracotta Warriors and Jewelled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals. The museum's permanent collections are grouped according to regions of Asia, namely, Southeast Asia, West Asia, China and South Asia.\nThere is also a very small gallery housing arterfacts related to the Singapore River. I've been puzzling over the purpose of the Singapore River gallery for some time. Shouldn't this gallery belong to the National Museum of Singapore? After some time, I came across the answer: The mission of the ACM is to promote awareness and appreciation of the history and culture of Singaporeans' ancestors, and the Singapore River was the reason they migrated here from the various parts of Asia. It may not be a coincidence, I suspect it's a deliberate choice--the ACM building itself overlooks the Singapore River.\nDespite the small size of the museum, there is no way you can completely cover all the galleries by going through all the artefacts' descriptions. The following are some artefacts you may find interesting. If you like you can treat it as a game of treasure hunt, but be aware that the museum does rotate its artefacts!\n1) Dong Son Drum - Southeast Asia\n2) Sukhothai Walking Buddha - Southeast Asia\n3) Buddha Protected by Naga Muchalinda - Southeast Asia\n4) Buddha's Footprint - Southeast Asia\n5) Dayak Skull - Southeast Asia\n6) Osa-osa - Southeast Asia\n8) Gamelan musical instruments - Southeast Asia\n9) 8th Century Monumental Qu'ran Folio - West Asia\n10) Kiswah - West Asia\n13) Dragon Robe - China\n15) Ancestor Portraits - China\n20) Shiva as a Beggar - South Asia\n21) Village Gods - South Asia\n22) Sandstone Seated Buddha - South Asia\n23) Chettiar Door - South Asia\n24) Cosmic Man Painting - South Asia\n25) Small Marble Jali Screens - South Asia\n26) Sandstone Jali Screens - South Asia\n27) The Gateway - South Asia\n28) Ghabagrha (Holy of holies in a Hindu temple) - South Asia\nOn my first day at the museum, I felt it was overwhelming. After spending some weekends there, I became more familiar with the place, and initially felt it was near perfect. But later, I began to feel that if the museum wishes to improve, it can explore 2 areas. The first is having more galleries devoted to China artefacts. After all, China has 5,000 years of history, and having only one gallery for China artefacts is not enough. Secondly, Christianity is the most widely practised religion in Singapore after Buddhism. Yet there are no artefacts on Christianity. It would be interesting to showcase artefacts that can tell some stories of Christianity in Asia.\nI love this museum. Although some of my friends tell me that museums are boring because they exhibit 'dead things', I feel that these 'dead things' help to bring history and culture alive to its visitors. I would like to conclude with this: Racial and religious harmony is one very key component of the Singapore identity, and ACM as a museum demonstrates this very well by housing artefacts of the different races and religions in Singapore under one roof.\nOptional Information:\nAsian history at its best\nJanuary 22, 2013\n4.0\nI brought my family here during August month when its usually free admission but I did paid for when the ACM hosted the terracotta warriors exhibition. Depending on your luck, the theme of the month may be real exciting or just the regular exhibits.\nEven there is no thematic exhibition, I feel a visit there is still worth it. The regular collection is awesome for an Asian to know more about their own roots, definitely a good way to learn Singapore history. The architecture of the Museum is breathtaking and the interior design makes you feel relaxed. The layout of the exhibits are also easy to navigate around.\nThe location is also a bonus with the Singapore river as a background for pictures and the Padang is great for chill out and watch some ruby or cricket games.\nOptional Information:\nInformative yet engaging\nJanuary 21, 2013\n4.0\nMind bogglingly big, as Singapore museums go. Do not even attempt to diligently read every word in the first exhibit if it doesn\u2019t interest you, because it will become a dread by the third exhibit. The content available is vast, and there is no way you can finish covering the museum in a mere day\u2014especially since they have quite a number of temporary exhibits, so you\u2019ll be chasing a moving target.\nYet it\u2019s incredibly informative and engaging, due to the quality of the exhibits and the interactive elements in the museum. At the end of the day, you actually walk away tired but fulfilled, because you actually take away something special from the visit to the museum.\nJ\nJoy\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2019 TheSmartLocal.com\n"

Surrounded by the winding paths and shrines of Ueno Park, the country\u2019s oldest museum is a must-see for everyone from historians to culture-vultures looking for a crash course. The unparalleled permanent collection contains more than 110,000 artifacts. Thankfully, the curators are sensible enough to space their vast array of treasures out. Each room feels carefully composed rather than cluttered, and special exhibitions rotate constantly, meaning the 4,000-odd works on display from the permanent collection at any given time are never quite the same as at your last visit.\nCourtesy Mori Art Museum\nGetty\nactivity\nOlaf Protze/Getty\n$$\nJourney 400 years back in time to Japan\u2019s past, when shoguns ruled the isolated nation with an iron fist.

Original woodblock prints and maps round out the nuanced picture. The museum highlights not only the larger political forces at play, but also the day-to-day lives of ordinary citizens. To enter the permanent exhibition area, visitors walk across a reproduction of the Nihonbashi Bridge before peering into replicas of tenement houses and other long-lost landmarks. As you move through the exhibits, you\u2019ll learn about everything from the Edo period\u2019s robust publishing industry to the rise of arts such as kabuki theater and ukiyo-e, or woodblock printing. After thoroughly exploring the past, the museum takes visitors through Tokyo\u2019s rapid transformation from a sheltered, feudal society to a globally oriented 21st-century metropolis.\nYuji Hori/Courtesy Nezu\n$$\nTraditional East Asian and Japanese art meet contemporary architecture in the Nezu Museum, a minimalist space redesigned by Kengo Kuma. High ceilings, bamboo walls, and enormous windows overlooking the museum\u2019s leafy surroundings in Aoyama district make this feel more like visiting the home of a sophisticated friend than a conventional gallery. That\u2019s fitting, since the museum was once the private residence of Nezu Kaichir\u014d, the president of Japan's Tobu Railway. Much of its impressive 7,400-piece collection comes from his private stash of pre-modern works. Although it\u2019s hardly unknown, the museum has managed to stay relatively under the radar and wandering through the six exhibition spaces even on weekends is a stress-free affair. Take in the sculpture, ceramics, and calligraphy at your own pace, then make your way to one of the most exquisite private gardens in the city.\nshow\nPacking List\nSign Up\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n.

            "Search\nSubscribe\nRSS\nSubscribe\nPlease deactivate your ad blocker in order to see our subscription offer\nShares\nCulture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.\nThe Center for Advance Research on Language Acquisition goes a step further, defining culture as shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs and understanding that are learned by socialization. Thus, it can be seen as the growth of a group identity fostered by social patterns unique to the group.\n\"Culture encompasses religion, food, what we wear, how we wear it, our language , marriage, music, what we believe is right or wrong, how we sit at the table, how we greet visitors, how we behave with loved ones, and a million other things,\" Cristina De Rossi, an anthropologist at Barnet and Southgate College in London, told Live Science.\nThe word \"culture\" derives from a French term, which in turn derives from the Latin \"colere,\" which means to tend to the earth and grow, or cultivation and nurture. \"It shares its etymology with a number of other words related to actively fostering growth,\" De Rossi said.\nWestern culture\nThe term \"Western culture\" has come to define the culture of European countries as well as those that have been heavily influenced by European immigration, such as the United States , according to Khan University . Western culture has its roots in the Classical Period of the Greco-Roman era and the rise of Christianity in the 14th century.\nOther drivers of Western culture include Latin, Celtic , Germanic and Hellenic ethnic and linguistic groups. Today, the influences of Western culture can be seen in almost every country in the world.\nEastern culture\nEastern culture generally refers to the societal norms of countries in Far East Asia (including China , Japan, Vietnam, North Korea and South Korea) and the Indian subcontinent. Like the West, Eastern culture was heavily influenced by religion during its early development, but it was also heavily influenced by the growth and harvesting of rice , according to the book \"Pathways to Asian Civilizations: Tracing the Origins and Spread of Rice and Rice Cultures\" by Dorian Q. Fuller. In general, in Eastern culture there is less of a distinction between secular society and religious philosophy than there is in the West.\nLatin culture\nMany of the Spanish-speaking nations are considered part of the Latin culture, while the geographic region is widespread. Latin America is typically defined as those parts of the Central America, South America and Mexico where Spanish or Portuguese are the dominant languages. Originally, the term \"Latin America\" was used by French geographers to differentiate between Anglo and Romance (Latin-based) languages, according to the University of Texas. While Spain and Portugal are on the European continent, they are considered the key influencers of what is known as Latin culture, which denotes people using languages derived from Latin, also known as Romance languages.\nMiddle Eastern culture\nThe countries of the Middle East have some but not all things in common. This is not a surprise, since the area consists of approximately 20 countries, according to PBS . The Arabic language is one thing that is common throughout the region; however, the wide variety of dialect can sometimes make communication difficult. Religion is another cultural area that the countries of the Middle East have in common. The Middle East is the birthplace of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nAfrican culture\nThe continent of Africa is essential to all cultures. Human life originated on this continent and began to migrate to other areas of the world around 60,000 years ago, according to the Natural History Museum in London. Other researchers, like those from Estonian Biocentre in Tartu, believe that the first migration may have been much earlier, as early as 120,000 years ago . Researchers come to these conclusions by studying human genomes from various cultures to trace their DNA to common ancestors. Fossil records also factor into some of these theories.\nAfrica is home to a number of tribes, ethnic and social groups. One of the key features of this culture is the large number of ethnic groups throughout the 54 countries on the continent. Nigeria alone has more than 300 tribes , for example.\nCurrently, Africa is divided into two cultural groups: North Africa and Sub- Saharan Africa. This is because Northwest Africa has strong ties to Middle East, while Sub-Saharan Africa shares historical, physical and social characteristics that are very different from North Africa, according to the University of Colorado . The harsh environment has been a large factor in the development of Sub-Saharan Africa culture, as there are a number of languages, cuisines, art and musical styles that have sprung up among the far-flung populations.\nConstant change\nNo matter what culture a people are a part of, one thing is for certain, it will change. \"Culture appears to have become key in our interconnected world, which is made up of so many ethnically diverse societies, but also riddled by conflicts associated with religion, ethnicity, ethical beliefs, and, essentially, the elements which make up culture,\" De Rossi said. \"But culture is no longer fixed, if it ever was. It is essentially fluid and constantly in motion.\" This makes it so that it is difficult to define any culture in only one way.\nWhile change is inevitable, the past should also be respected and preserved. The United Nations has created a group called The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to identify cultural and natural heritage and to conserve and protect it. Monuments, building and sites are covered by the group's protection, according to the international treaty, the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage . This treaty was adopted by UNESCO in 1972.\nAdditional reporting by Alina Bradford, Live Science Contributor\nAdditional resources\nStay up to date on the coronavirus outbreak by signing up to our newsletter today.\nThank you for signing up to Live Science.

            "MoPOP\nView of MoPOP from the Seattle Center with the monorail traveling through it\nEstablished\n2000\nLocation\nMonorail tracks going through the MoPOP building\nThe Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP (previously called EMP Museum) is a nonprofit museum dedicated to contemporary popular culture . It was founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2000 as the Experience Music Project. Since that time MoPOP has organized dozens of exhibits, 17 of which have toured across the US and internationally.\nThe museum\u2014which used to be known as Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (EMP|SFM) and later EMP Museum until November 2016\u2014has founded many public programs including \"Sound Off!\", an annual 21-and-under battle-of-the-bands that supports the all-ages scene; and \"Pop Conference,\" an annual gathering of academics, critics, musicians, and music buffs.\nContents\nNighttime view of MoPOP\nGuitar sculpture at MoPOP\nMoPOP is home to exhibits, interactive activity stations, sound sculpture, and various educational resources.\nA 140,000-square-foot (13,000\u00a0m2) building, designed by Frank O. Gehry , that houses several galleries and the Sky Church, which features a Barco C7 black package LED screen, one of the largest indoor LED screens in the world. [1]\nExhibits that cover pop culture, from the art of fantasy, horror cinema, and video games to science fiction literature and costumes from screen and stage.\nInteractive activities included in galleries like Sound Lab and On Stage where visitors can explore hands-on the tools of rock and roll through instruments, and perform music before a virtual audience.\nIF VI WAS IX, a guitar sculpture consisting of more than 500 musical instruments and 30 computers conceived by UK exhibit designer Neal Potter and developed by sound sculptor Trimpin . [2] [3]\nThe largest collections in the world of artifacts, hand-written lyrics, personal instruments, and original photographs celebrating the music and history of Seattle musicians Nirvana and Jimi Hendrix .\nEducational resources including MoPOP's Curriculum Connections in-museum workshops and outreach programs; STAR (Student Training in Artistic Reach); Creativity Camps for Kids; Teen Artist Workshops; Write Out of This World, an annual sci-fi and fantasy short story contest for 3rd to 12th graders; and the Hip-Hop Artist Residency.\nPublic programs such as MoPOP's Science Fiction + Fantasy Short Film Festival, Pop Conference, the Youth Advisory Board (YAB), and Sound Off! the Northwest's premier battle-of-the-bands.\nMoPOP was the site of the concert and demo program of the first NIME workshop, which subsequently became the annual International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression , a leading venue for cutting edge research on music technology.\nScience Fiction Museum[ edit ]\nThe Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame was founded by Paul Allen and Jody Patton and opened to the public on June 18, 2004. It incorporated the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame which had been established in 1996 (below). The museum was divided into several galleries with common themes such as \"Homeworld,\" \"Fantastic Voyages,\" \"Brave New Worlds,\" and \"Them!\" Each gallery displayed related memorabilia (movie props, first editions, costumes, and models) in large display cases, posters, and interactive displays to sketch out the different subjects. \"From robots to jet packs to space suits and ray guns, it's all here.\" [4] Members of the museum's advisory board included Steven Spielberg , Ray Bradbury , James Cameron , and George Lucas . Among its collection of artifacts were Captain Kirk 's command chair from Star Trek , the B9 robot from Lost in Space , the Death Star model from Star Wars , the T800 Terminator and the dome from the film Silent Running . Although the Science Fiction Museum as a permanent collection was de-installed in March 2011, a new exhibit named Icons of Science Fiction opened as a replacement in June 2012, [5] [6] at which time the new Hall of Fame display was unveiled and the class of 2012 inducted. [7] [8]\nScience Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame[ edit ]\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame was founded in 1996 by the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society ( Kansas City, Missouri ) and the Center for the Study of Science Fiction (CSSF) at the University of Kansas (KU). The chairmen were Keith Stokes (1996\u20132001) and Robin Wayne Bailey (2002\u20132004). Only writers and editors were eligible for recognition and four were inducted annually, two deceased and two living. Each class of four was announced at Kansas City's annual science fiction convention, ConQuesT , and inducted at the Campbell Conference hosted by CSSF. [9] [10]\nThe Hall of Fame stopped inducting fantasy writers after 2004, when it became part of the Science Fiction Museum affiliated with MoPOP, under the name \"Science Fiction Hall of Fame\". Having inducted 36 writers in nine years, the organization began to recognize non-literary media in 2005. [9] It retained the quota of four new members and thus reduced the annual number of writers. The 2005 and 2006 press releases placed new members in \"Literature\", \"Art\", \"Film, Television and Media\", and \"Open\" categories, one each. [11] [12] In 2007 and 2008, the fourth inductee was placed in one of the three substantial categories. [13] [14]\nMoPOP de-installed the Science Fiction Museum in March 2011. When the exhibition \"Icons of Science Fiction\" opened in June 2012, a new Hall of Fame display was unveiled and the class of 2012 inducted. [5] [6] [7]\nNominations are submitted by the public but the selections are made by \"award-winning science fiction authors, artists, editors, publishers, and film professionals.\" [15]\nMoPOP restored the original name online during June 2013 and announced five new members, one daily, beginning June 17. The first four were cited largely or wholly for science fiction but the last was J.R.R. Tolkien, \"hailed as the father of modern fantasy literature\". [16]\nIn 2016 the scope was changed again to include not only creators, but creations (examples of genre Cinema , Television and Games), with two examples of each being honoured. Also, in this twentieth anniversary year, a total of twenty additional inductees in both categories were announced. [17]\nThe class of 2017 brings the number of members to 92, plus twenty extra added in 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the museum.\nScience Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inductions [9] [18]\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of the museum in 2016, twenty other creators and works were inducted into the Hall of Fame: [23]\nIn November 2016 EMP Museum announced a rebrand to Museum of Pop Culture, or MoPOP. [26]\nAn exterior view of the building\nMoPOP is located on the campus of Seattle Center , adjacent to the Space Needle and the Seattle Center Monorail , which runs through the building. The structure itself was designed by Frank Gehry and resembles many of his firm's other works in its sheet-metal construction, such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao , Walt Disney Concert Hall , and Gehry Tower . Much of the building material is exposed in the building's interior. The building contains 140,000 square feet (13,000\u00a0m2), with a 35,000-square-foot (3,300\u00a0m2) footprint. The name of the museum's central Sky Church pays homage to Jimi Hendrix . A concert venue capable of holding up to 800 guests, Sky Church boasts 70-foot ceilings, state-of-the-art sound and lighting, and a mammoth indoor HD LED screen. The last structural steel beam to be put in place bears the signatures of all construction workers who were on site on the day it was erected. Hoffman Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, was the general contractor. Magnusson Klemencic Associates of Seattle were the structural engineers for the project. [27]\nEven before groundbreaking, Seattle Weekly said the design could refer to \"the often quoted comparison to a smashed electric guitar.\" Indeed, Gehry himself had made the comparison, \"We started collecting pictures of Stratocasters, bringing in guitar bodies, drawing on those shapes in developing our ideas.\" [28] The architecture was greeted by Seattle residents with a mixture of acclaim for Gehry and derision for this particular edifice. \"Frank Gehry,\" remarked British-born, Seattle-based writer Jonathan Raban , \"has created some wonderful buildings, like the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, but his Seattle effort, the Experience Music Project, is not one of them.\" [29] New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp described it as \"something that crawled out of the sea, rolled over, and died.\" [30] Forbes magazine called it one of the world's 10 ugliest buildings. [30] Others describe it as a \"blob\" [31] or call it \"The Hemorrhoids \". [29] Despite some critical reviews of the structure, the building has been called \"a fitting backdrop for the world's largest collection of Jimi Hendrix memorabilia.\" [32] The outside of the building which features a fusion of textures and colors, including gold, silver, deep red, blue and a \"shimmering purple haze,\" [33] has been declared \"an apt representation of the American rock experience.\" [34]\nThe museum has had mixed financial success. [35] [36] In an effort to raise more funds, museum organizers used Allen's extensive art collection to create a 2006 exhibit within the confines of the MoPOP. [37] The exhibit was entitled DoubleTake: From Monet to Lichtenstein. The exhibit included Roy Lichtenstein 's The Kiss (1962), Pierre-Auguste Renoir 's The Reader (1877), Vincent van Gogh 's Orchard with Peach Trees in Blossom (1888), Pablo Picasso 's Four Bathers (1921) and several works of art from Claude Monet including one of the Water Lilies paintings (1919) and The Mula Palace (1908). [38] Since then the museum has organized numerous exhibitions focused more specifically on popular culture: Sound and Vision: Artists Tell Their Stories, which opened February 28, 2007, for example, brought together both music and science fiction in a single exhibit, and drew on the museum's extensive collection of oral history recordings. [39] The museum's recent exhibitions have ranged from horror cinema, video games, and black leather jackets to fantasy film and literature.\nCS1 maint: archived copy as title ( link )\nDuring 1997 Neal worked alongside Frank Gehry Architects and the EMP curatorial team to establish a masterplan for the attraction. The detail design was undertaken locally. Originally called \"The Collision Sculpture\", the point of collision of different genres of music to create rock and roll.

            "(212) 769-5100\nI am so glad that we had the opportunity to come here. Let me start out by saying, this is the kind of place that you are going to need more than one day to see everything. Especially, if you love history.\n\nFrom the moment you enter the museum, you are greeted by two large dinosaur skeletons. My daughter was ecstatic, and couldn't wait to see more. The time to get admission tickets looked tedious, but the lines moved very quickly.\n\nOnce inside, you have many possible destinations. Exhibits on ancient civilizations, animals (both current and extinct), dinosaur and prehistoric animal skeletons, etc... Many exhibits change throughout the year, so there is always something new to see as well.\n\nIf you enjoy learning about history, it can take a few hours to really see a full exhibit. There is a lot of printed information to read. Depending on how busy they are, it can take awhile to get through everything an exhibit has to offer. \n\nEven the gift shop has something for everyone. It is several floors, and has just about everything you can think of. Great opportunity to buy some souvenirs. \n\nAgain, this is a great place to visit when in NYC with something for everyone. I recommend visiting them!\nIf you have the opportunity to check out this museum, you must go. You won't regret it. Just make sure you have enough time and the right amount of patience to make it through. \n\nWe went on a Monday morning in mid-November and it was PACKED. Like, sardines in a can packed. The lines for the tickets took half an hour, so I recommend buying them ahead of time if possible. The museum is massive and you could easily spend all day here (actually, you probably need a couple days to see everything). I found it a bit challenging to browse each exhibit due to the constant bombardment of crowds. It always felt like we were being rushed to the next exhibit. I'm used to leisurely strolling though museums and taking my sweet time reading everything, so that was a bummer. We also had to wait in lines to see a lot of the exhibits. A good portion of our time was spent just waiting. \n\nThat being said, this museum has a remarkable array of extensive and elaborate collections. My favorites were the biodiversity hall and the human origin hall. The aptly named titanosaur is breathtaking and must been seen on your visit. You can tell from the exhibits that this museum has a dedicated team of curators who are able to convey complex stories through these unique collections.\nCame here yesterday to watch the showing of the \"Volcanoes: The fires of creation\" at the Lefrak Theater (which is inside the museum). The theater was spacious with an orchestra and mezzanine seating, but seating was only opened in the orchestra level. My showing was from 6:30-7pm and doors opened at 6pm. When the show started there was about 100 people, mainly children with their parents.\n\nThe film did a good job on showing the importance and devastation of volcanoes in the past and present--it was like watching a National Geographic documentary. The 3-D graphics provided contrast and depth that made it feel real--almost as if I was there. The show lasted about 45 minutes and as I exited, they were free packaged cookies with printed volcanoes on them that you could take home.\n\nBeside this showing, I have been to this museum numerous times to see all the exhibits and I would still go back every now and then. From the Native American history to the giant floating whale to the dinosaur exhibit to the Hayden planetarium, one could easily spend between 2-6 hours in this museum. I personally love museums and learning about history so I would usually spend about a whole day here.\n\nI would highly recommend coming here, first time or not. Other than the stable exhibition (ones that are here all year long), they also have new exhibitions opening here and there, but aren't free. The general admission is free (by the pay-as-what-you-want policy) During peak times like the weekend, it could get crowded and noisy so I would go during off times.\nThis is probably one of my favorite museums in NYC! \n\nI love the continuous exhibits and the newer installations are always well done. The newest one I've been to is the Geology section with rocks and such. \n\nThey're opening a new gemstones and colors exhibits soon! I am excited to go, but given the current status w/ the Corona Virus, that might have to wait! \n\nThe animals and dinosaurs sections are always fun. It's almost like being at the zoo when it's too cold out to actually go to a zoo. Unfortunately, though, the museum's animals are dead or not really real. \n\nThey have a huge area with Native American histories too. Definitely worth checking everything out if you can manage it all in a day! Usually I spend anywhere from 3 to 8 hours on just a few sections! So much information. \n\nThe space area is really designed cool. You get to feel like you're in another world. This space is also really interactive. You can see how much you weigh on different planets. \n\nThere are a few gift shops spaced throughout the various wings of the building so if you want to snag something before you leave you don't have to travel too far, unless you want something specific or themed to a specific area, then you might. \n\nThe bathrooms are decent. Depends on the person before you who used them. \n\nAlso - for nine months of the year they host a Sci Cafe where you get to learn cool things about various topics. The last one I went to was about Sea Turtles and their Geomagnetic Navigation. It's every 1st Wednesday of the month. Definitely excite your brain with some cool finds! \n\nTry an Imax film or the planetarium. Bring the kids, go with your boo, or venture out for a solo expedition. You're going to have fun no matter which way you attempt to experience it. \n\nHappy explorations!\nI love visiting all kinds of museums when I'm in new places and natural history museums are my favorite. This one is gigantic and the first hall that you're greeted with is pretty new and updated. The rest of them could use a ton of work. I'm the type of person that wants to learn something while I'm there so I spend a ton of time reading signage. That was extremely difficult to do between displays with flickering lights, bulbs for backlit signs being burnt out, poor font color choices, or placement of signs. I had to completely give up reading some displays because it just wasn't worth the eye strain.\n\nI think there are parts of the museum that could be better organized. The rooms don't really flow together and the signage is a bit confusing. Ticketing was a nightmare because it was a relatively short line but took forever. Also getting into the planetarium show was lines to get on an elevator, then lines to get into the waiting area, then another wait before they let us in. Before we were let in a very impatient and sassy employee (think teacher waiting for their class to quiet down) had to explain some ground rules to the group. There had to be a better way to get everyone's attention than relying on everyone to shush the person behind them.\nA must-see attraction in New York plus it's conveniently located near Central Park:)\n\nCheck out link below for video format review\n\n https://youtu.be/A1BZ73v5GOg\nIt saddens me to only give it 3 stars.\n\nOf course I have been here many many times. During this visit, I noticed many elements that I feel could be improved on, as well as things that I wish they set up differently. \n\nThe exterior is simply breathtaking - it's grand, it's from another era, the architecture is just beautiful. The only time you can experience this same feeling from inside is in the main lobby. For every other hall in the museum, you could be anywhere else. You forget that you are in this architectural wonder.\n\nThe halls desperately need updating. They feel stale and outdated. The lighting is poor, as is the signage. It feels like it all needs a complete overhaul. It should match the beauty of the exterior. \n\nI also feel that, in some cases, the displays were lacking. I would go to particular hall, and it felt sparse. \n\nThe dioramas and dinosaur exhibits are what to go for. They are truly beautifully done and from so long ago. To me, this is part of the exhibit as well - the history of the actual displays.\nThis museum is pretty cool. I went here in 2016 with a friend when in NY on a girls trip and then went back in 2019 with my son and husband. My son used to be a fan of the Night At The Museum movie so it was cool to be in the museum it was filmed in. There is SO much to see there. It's super informative and amazing to see so many dinosaurs, tribal collections, butterflies and more. I definitely thinks it's great to check out as an adult and with kids. I went without a kid before but knew I had to go back with my son as he likes dinosaurs and my husband is a huge history guy. The first time I went we also walked through Central Park and Times Square, there were multiple things to check out nearby. Last time in 2019 it was not long after my injury, so just doing the museum was enough for me and my limited energy.\nThis was my go to museum for sometime. I can't help but feel it has become a bit dated. \n\nTo start, place need a little cleaning up. Many displays covered in dust and the bathrooms were not clean.\n\nI tried the app, which only pointed out the obvious stuff and didn't really assist. \n\nThere is no obvious flow, in fact, some halls will lead to a dead end or loop around.\n\nMany of the dinosaur exhibits are not original skeletons, which kind of takes away from the experience. \n\nIt's not a bad museum, but having come here a couple of times, I feel like I've covered it.\nStand in line for the \"pay as you wish\" or get tickets at the kiosks adult $23 children $13\n\nBrought my toddler son here mainly for the dinosaurs.  \nThere was a new dinosaur fossil exhibit featuring a huge herbivore that spanned an entire hall, which was a plus.  \nI'm sure it was geared towards young children since you walk through 3 gift stores during the exhibit. =T\nWe will be back for a show or two when he's older!\nBuy your tickets online before going!\n\nI went to AMNH with my wife and 10yo son. After about an hour of looking at fossils, my son was more than done. There are hours and hours of bones and it can be redundant and boring after a while. I get it, millions of years of history but it was a lot for a kid to endure.\n\nThere were some other really cool exhibits that we rushed through since we spent so much time looking at fossils. I wish we would have cut the fossil viewing shorter or spaced it out with some of the other (Native American artifacts, animals of the world, etc.) exhibits. I would definitely go back but I would be more strategic and better prepared if I go back with my son.\nI've come here multiple times. If you have kids - I feel like this is a good place to just let them BE. Its HUGE here so theres always alot to see. I recommend getting the yearly pass. It's a little over $100 for the year and covers 5 people. It also includes the special exhibits. If you DONT have the yearly pass- it's can be as much as $25 per person - per EXHIBIT. it's too much. \n\nThis place can get really PACKED. Certain sections of the museum are more narrow and dont have alot of space. So that can get a little uncomfortable. You'll definitely have to hold onto your kids just to make sure you dont lose them. \n\nI always feel myself flying through the dinosaur section. The part that has all the bones and fossils. The flow of this place is a little off. I always feel like I cant stand in one section too long because theres always people rushing past you. Someone always needs you to move out of there way. The way all of the items are positioned - make the walk path too narrow. Theres too many up and down little steps that make it hard for the elderly and smaller kids to get up and down fast. I'm always extra careful of the little ones here because the stairs are cement. \n\nOne of my favorite spaces is right where the HUGE whale is. The space is wide open and has a bunch of sea animals on display in windows. You can let the kids run around and keep your eye on them. If theres any special events going on- they tend to use THIS space to do that in. That's probably the only down fall. \n\nMy second favorite is the butterfly exhibit. That room is something everyone should experience. I love it SO much. Seeing so many beautiful butterflies is amazing. So many different colors and sizes. I had the pleasure of having one land on me. Def def def a must see. \n\n\nI will continue to come here. If you arrived at 10am - by 2pm you'll be out the door. Thats what I normally do. It's an easy quick outing with the kids. I also park inside the museum. Makes everything super convenient. \n\nBtw the Waffles and Dingz cart outside the museum is a MUST TRY. Go get IT.\nReview #499!\n\nCame here with the family as the first segment of our NY long weekend vacation. The quality of the artifacts, descriptions, and cleanliness of the museum are definitely five-star. There are thousands of artifacts over multiple genres such as Indigenous People, Oceans, Dinosaurs, Universe, Mammals, and Birds to name a few. Everything was well spaced out.\n\nWhat there were also thousands of were visitors even though we got there within an hour of opening. Our fault coming on a holiday weekend. We took the subway and then had to wait in a 15 minute line even though we already had our tickets. Security was relatively quick, and once in we did not have too much of any issues getting around. There was some bumping of others, and some strollers (which had to be parked at certain sections), but not much agonizing moments. Unfortunately, the museum is absolutely not soundproofed and there was a mighty constant roar of noise throughout the entire facility, and left my whole family and me with headaches after about three hours. Additionally, the heat was blasting and made certain sections uncomfortable. We did need to leave without seeing everything the museum had to offer.\n\nWe also did purchase food in the main food court. Again, because we went at the lunch rush, had to search high and low for a table and ended up asking a staffer to sit with him as he was by himself at a 4-top. The $3.74 per 1/4 pound weight for salads and hot buffet is deceiving if you pile on...it's about $16 a pound! They also have prepared foods like hot dogs, burgers, and pizza. Food alone was $84 for our family of four.\n\nThe museum is pay what you want, but there is a recommendation of what to pay and I included a picture of it. If you get tickets online, then you're about $25 an adult.\n\nAnother gripe I had was that there was a Kwanza celebration within the Oceana exhibit which was a couple of dozen vendor stands that were set up completely blocking the diorama exhibits within the whole floor. I would have felt the same if it were for any other holiday using vendors to block exhibits. Not what I came to the museum for.\n\nDefinitely worth the visit, but probably at non-peak hours and days. I should have brought earplugs. My family and I really enjoyed what we did see and explored.\nPlease read other folks reviews! Giving only 3 stars is totally based on our personal experience.\n\nAt 3:15PM, no significant line to get in because it closes at 5:45. AFTER paying the \"donation,\" we learned the only exhibit my mom really cared to see was closed for renovations. Confirming that yes, you \"could\" pay only $0.01 to enter, my mom almost asked for a refund. FYI, my mom chose to pay the price for 2 seniors, vs 1 senior & 1 adult.\n\nWe only had time to explore 1 floor: She chose the 1st floor (1 level down from the entry/ticket booths). We were both disappointed that many exhibits' videos didn't work. We were delighted to learn things from the 1st floor helper/volunteer. & we thankful that someone took a pic of us with the statue of Roosevelt.\n\nAt my mom's \"snail-pace,\" the 1st floor & gift shop visit took us 2.5 hours (yet I wished we had time to see more!). If you want to see the majority of the museum, plan at least 3-4 hours (at a swifter pace than us - which means you won't read \"everything\"/listen to every presentation), FYI.\n\nDo hope the rest of the museum is in better \"working order.\" A large reason for star deductions is because though beautifully laid out and presented in general, the museum had a lot of issues: Things that didn't work/mis-aimed lighting for small objects, little to nothing to see in 1 room (semi under-construction \"Canoe room\"), etc. We were wondering if this is throughout the museum or merely limited to the 1st floor?  We don't know. But this was our experience. \n\nYES, this museum is a worthy visit! As of 11/2019 to us at our late arrival time, it wasn't worth the requested admission price. But yes, you CAN choose to pay less. At the same time, I'm curious if lesser admission collections directly affect the upkeep of the exhibits? If so, then I encourage all to give the asking price to \"pay it forward.\" Not to be a skeptic, but yes there's part of me wondering about management and where the funds/donations go especially given the attention needed on the 1st floor.\nThe inside dioramas and exhibits are simply breathtaking.   Four full levels of interactive attractions depicting the history of predator and prey, along with an excellent T Rex and aquatic themed exhibit on the lower level. I suggest getting there as early as possible to take in as much as you can before the museum closes at 5:45pm.  Student discounts are available.  The initial admission line moves quickly.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the Hayden Planetarium Space Show or the fact that many attractions dump you right in a tchotchke gift shop afterwards,but overall an excellent museum that you could literally take days to explore.\nWow. Just wow. This place has always been on my bucket list and I was so excited to check it off today. We took the subway in and arrived through the LL floor. The ticket line moved quickly. We opted for the additional exhibit for the T. rex exhibit. It was amazing!!!! So worth it!\n\nAll in all, I would totally recommend this place. It was everything I dreamt and more. Halls and halls of interesting and amazing things. Very clean facility. Very friendly staff. We'll be back again!\nOne of my favorite museums. \nA ton of fun and endless about of information to learn and inspirations to find. \nLove the \"Worlds beyond Earth\" movie shown at the Planetarium. \nThe crowd was not too bad, definitely alot of children but a everyone must make a stop to this museum at least once a year. Their exhibitions and cinema shorts are worth viewing!\nI think that I've been coming to the AMNH for more than 40 years and I am surprised that in all my visits while being an Official Yelper, that I didn't include something about this amazing place.   I was there very recently to see their own Origami Christmas Tree as I like to include it on my \"PiercingKen\" Instagram where related images are stockpiled during this season.   Once I was done photographing that, I explored deeper into the place and sure, while I have seen so many of the exhibits before I surely don't mind seeing them again.  \n\nGenerally speaking, I like to tell the folks who ask me about an upcoming visit what to see first and I say go to the dinosaurs since they are on an upper floor and there is a lot of photo ops to do.  It's always my first stop and then the hall of animals is where I like to spend some time and admire the detailed setups.  During my visit there was a big T-Rex exhibit that shared a lot of the newfound knowledge about the original King Of The Beasts.  It was super interesting and I made sure to snap a number of pictures of that.  Another area I like to spend a lot of time in is where the giant blue whale is along with the other sea creatures.  \n\nI don't generally spend much time in the sections with other cultures because its a time thing more than a lack of interest.  If you get there later than planned you should aim at the big stuff first but if you are an anthropology student of any kind then you must hit the assorted people exhibits as there is Indian, Asian and African cultures to examine that will aid your studies.  \n\nSuggestions:  Arrive early so you can see as much as possible.  Wear comfortable shoes or sneakers as there is a LOT of walking to do.  I'd bring a couple of bottles of water and some bags of chips or energy bars along with you and be sure that your mobile devices are fully charged and you have a battery pack or the plug.  I didn't notice too many outlets to use so the battery pack is a must.    There is an open WiFi signal to use which is helpful and I would try to avoid going on major holidays since it will be packed.  If you are visiting my city from another country then please add this place to your itinerary.  So far I have taken visiting friends from South America and Scandinavia here and each of the groups loved it.\n\nThat's all I have.  Enjoy.\nI love this place! So much to see and do! \n\nCame during the holiday break and the place was PACKED! We still managed to look at the T-Rex exhibit, Oceans show in 3D and also the butterfly conservatory. All was thoroughly enjoyed by the kids. The place is huge so give yourself at least half a day to see all the cool things. \n\nWater fountains and filling stations readily available on most floors. Gift shop has pretty neat stuff to buy too. \n\nThere is a restaurant on site and there are also lots of eateries on Columbus Circle.\nThis is a lovely museum! I am such a NY n00blet that I realized that the entrance cost can be a \"suggested\" price (although you might be stuck in a long line if you're not buying a ticket via online or kiosk). However, there is a set price for some extra activities in the museum. \n\nI've enjoyed my little walk in this museum and personally love the animal exhibits. They look so life like! The short information some of the exhibit has is perfect for someone like me who prefers to \"look\" than \"read\" in museums. I hope to come back and try to actually do their activities.\nLoading interface...\n2077 reviews\nCOVID-19 Advisory:Business operations may be affected\nDue to ongoing precautionary measures, please contact the business directly for updated hours and availability.\nReview Highlights\n\u201cWhat makes AMNH stand out from other natural history museums in the world is the amount of work put into the showcases.\u201d in 133 reviews\n\u201cDefinitely take in the Hall of African Mammals, the Hall of North American Mammals, and the hall of Ocean Life .\u201d in 76 reviews\n\u201cOh but look at the Hall of Biodiversity ! yes,.. lets learn to appreciate this planet we call home,..\u201d in 40 reviews\nThe American Museum of Natural History, founded in 1869 and currently celebrating its 150th anniversary, is one of the world's preeminent scientific, educational, and cultural institutions. The Museum encompasses 45 permanent exhibition halls, including those in the Rose Center for Earth and Space plus the Hayden Planetarium, as well as galleries for temporary exhibitions. It is home to New York State's official memorial to Theodore Roosevelt, a tribute to Roosevelt's enduring legacy of environmental conservation. The Museum's approximately 200 scientists draw on a world-class research collection of more than 34 million artifacts and specimens, some of which are billions of years old, and on one of the largest natural history libraries in the world. Through its Richard Gilder Graduate School, the Museum grants the Ph.D. degree in Comparative Biology and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree, the only such free-standing, degree-granting programs at any museum in the United States. Annual on-site attendance has grown to approximately 5 million, and the Museum's exhibitions and Space Shows can be seen in venues on six continents. The Museum's website, digital videos, and apps for mobile devices bring its collections, exhibitions, and educational programs to millions more around the world.\u2026\nAnswer:\nActually there is parking.

Let me start out by saying, this is the kind of place that you are going to need more than one day to see everything. Especially, if you love history.\nFrom the moment you enter the museum, you are greeted by two large dinosaur skeletons. My daughter was ecstatic, and couldn't wait to see more. The time to get admission tickets looked tedious, but the lines moved very quickly.\nOnce inside, you have many possible destinations. Exhibits on ancient civilizations, animals (both current and extinct), dinosaur and prehistoric animal skeletons, etc... Many exhibits change throughout the year, so there is always something new to see as well.\nIf you enjoy learning about history, it can take a few hours to really see a full exhibit. There is a lot of printed information to read. Depending on how busy they are, it can take awhile to get through everything an exhibit has to offer.\nEven the gift shop has something for everyone. It is several floors, and has just about everything you can think of. Great opportunity to buy some souvenirs.\nAgain, this is a great place to visit when in NYC with something for everyone. I recommend visiting them!\nIf you have the opportunity to check out this museum, you must go. You won't regret it. Just make sure you have enough time and the right amount of patience to make it through.\nWe went on a Monday morning in mid-November and it was PACKED. Like, sardines in a can packed. The lines for the tickets took half an hour, so I recommend buying them ahead of time if possible. The museum is massive and you could easily spend all day here (actually, you probably need a couple days to see everything). I found it a bit challenging to browse each exhibit due to the constant bombardment of crowds. It always felt like we were being rushed to the next exhibit. I'm used to leisurely strolling though museums and taking my sweet time reading everything, so that was a bummer. We also had to wait in lines to see a lot of the exhibits. A good portion of our time was spent just waiting.\nThat being said, this museum has a remarkable array of extensive and elaborate collections. My favorites were the biodiversity hall and the human origin hall. The aptly named titanosaur is breathtaking and must been seen on your visit. You can tell from the exhibits that this museum has a dedicated team of curators who are able to convey complex stories through these unique collections.\nCame here yesterday to watch the showing of the \"Volcanoes: The fires of creation\" at the Lefrak Theater (which is inside the museum). The theater was spacious with an orchestra and mezzanine seating, but seating was only opened in the orchestra level. My showing was from 6:30-7pm and doors opened at 6pm. When the show started there was about 100 people, mainly children with their parents.\nThe film did a good job on showing the importance and devastation of volcanoes in the past and present--it was like watching a National Geographic documentary. The 3-D graphics provided contrast and depth that made it feel real--almost as if I was there. The show lasted about 45 minutes and as I exited, they were free packaged cookies with printed volcanoes on them that you could take home.\nBeside this showing, I have been to this museum numerous times to see all the exhibits and I would still go back every now and then. From the Native American history to the giant floating whale to the dinosaur exhibit to the Hayden planetarium, one could easily spend between 2-6 hours in this museum. I personally love museums and learning about history so I would usually spend about a whole day here.\nI would highly recommend coming here, first time or not. Other than the stable exhibition (ones that are here all year long), they also have new exhibitions opening here and there, but aren't free. The general admission is free (by the pay-as-what-you-want policy) During peak times like the weekend, it could get crowded and noisy so I would go during off times.\nThis is probably one of my favorite museums in NYC!\nI love the continuous exhibits and the newer installations are always well done. The newest one I've been to is the Geology section with rocks and such.\nThey're opening a new gemstones and colors exhibits soon! I am excited to go, but given the current status w/ the Corona Virus, that might have to wait!\nThe animals and dinosaurs sections are always fun. It's almost like being at the zoo when it's too cold out to actually go to a zoo. Unfortunately, though, the museum's animals are dead or not really real.\nThey have a huge area with Native American histories too. Definitely worth checking everything out if you can manage it all in a day! Usually I spend anywhere from 3 to 8 hours on just a few sections! So much information.\nThe space area is really designed cool. You get to feel like you're in another world. This space is also really interactive. You can see how much you weigh on different planets.\nThere are a few gift shops spaced throughout the various wings of the building so if you want to snag something before you leave you don't have to travel too far, unless you want something specific or themed to a specific area, then you might.\nThe bathrooms are decent. Depends on the person before you who used them.\nAlso - for nine months of the year they host a Sci Cafe where you get to learn cool things about various topics. The last one I went to was about Sea Turtles and their Geomagnetic Navigation. It's every 1st Wednesday of the month. Definitely excite your brain with some cool finds!\nTry an Imax film or the planetarium. Bring the kids, go with your boo, or venture out for a solo expedition. You're going to have fun no matter which way you attempt to experience it.\nHappy explorations!\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\nEmily L.\nI love visiting all kinds of museums when I'm in new places and natural history museums are my favorite. This one is gigantic and the first hall that you're greeted with is pretty new and updated. The rest of them could use a ton of work. I'm the type of person that wants to learn something while I'm there so I spend a ton of time reading signage. That was extremely difficult to do between displays with flickering lights, bulbs for backlit signs being burnt out, poor font color choices, or placement of signs. I had to completely give up reading some displays because it just wasn't worth the eye strain.\nI think there are parts of the museum that could be better organized. The rooms don't really flow together and the signage is a bit confusing. Ticketing was a nightmare because it was a relatively short line but took forever. Also getting into the planetarium show was lines to get on an elevator, then lines to get into the waiting area, then another wait before they let us in. Before we were let in a very impatient and sassy employee (think teacher waiting for their class to quiet down) had to explain some ground rules to the group. There had to be a better way to get everyone's attention than relying on everyone to shush the person behind them.\nCheck out link below for video format review\nIt saddens me to only give it 3 stars.\nOf course I have been here many many times. During this visit, I noticed many elements that I feel could be improved on, as well as things that I wish they set up differently.\nThe exterior is simply breathtaking - it's grand, it's from another era, the architecture is just beautiful. The only time you can experience this same feeling from inside is in the main lobby. For every other hall in the museum, you could be anywhere else. You forget that you are in this architectural wonder.\nThe halls desperately need updating. They feel stale and outdated. The lighting is poor, as is the signage. It feels like it all needs a complete overhaul. It should match the beauty of the exterior.\nI also feel that, in some cases, the displays were lacking. I would go to particular hall, and it felt sparse.\nThe dioramas and dinosaur exhibits are what to go for. They are truly beautifully done and from so long ago. To me, this is part of the exhibit as well - the history of the actual displays.\nThis museum is pretty cool. I went here in 2016 with a friend when in NY on a girls trip and then went back in 2019 with my son and husband. My son used to be a fan of the Night At The Museum movie so it was cool to be in the museum it was filmed in. There is SO much to see there. It's super informative and amazing to see so many dinosaurs, tribal collections, butterflies and more. I definitely thinks it's great to check out as an adult and with kids. I went without a kid before but knew I had to go back with my son as he likes dinosaurs and my husband is a huge history guy. The first time I went we also walked through Central Park and Times Square, there were multiple things to check out nearby. Last time in 2019 it was not long after my injury, so just doing the museum was enough for me and my limited energy.\nThis was my go to museum for sometime. I can't help but feel it has become a bit dated.\nTo start, place need a little cleaning up. Many displays covered in dust and the bathrooms were not clean.\nI tried the app, which only pointed out the obvious stuff and didn't really assist.\nThere is no obvious flow, in fact, some halls will lead to a dead end or loop around.\nMany of the dinosaur exhibits are not original skeletons, which kind of takes away from the experience.\nIt's not a bad museum, but having come here a couple of times, I feel like I've covered it.\nStand in line for the \"pay as you wish\" or get tickets at the kiosks adult $23 children $13\nBrought my toddler son here mainly for the dinosaurs.\nThere was a new dinosaur fossil exhibit featuring a huge herbivore that spanned an entire hall, which was a plus.\nI'm sure it was geared towards young children since you walk through 3 gift stores during the exhibit. =T\nWe will be back for a show or two when he's older!\nBuy your tickets online before going!\nI went to AMNH with my wife and 10yo son. After about an hour of looking at fossils, my son was more than done. There are hours and hours of bones and it can be redundant and boring after a while. I get it, millions of years of history but it was a lot for a kid to endure.\nThere were some other really cool exhibits that we rushed through since we spent so much time looking at fossils. I wish we would have cut the fossil viewing shorter or spaced it out with some of the other (Native American artifacts, animals of the world, etc.) exhibits. I would definitely go back but I would be more strategic and better prepared if I go back with my son.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nBuy your tickets online before going!\nI went to AMNH with my wife and 10yo son. \u00a0After about an hour of looking at fossils, my son was more than done. \u00a0There are hours and hours of bones and it can be redundant and boring after a while. \u00a0I get it, millions of years of history but it was a lot for a kid to endure.\nThere were some other really cool exhibits that we rushed through since we spent so much time looking at fossils. \u00a0I wish we would have cut the fossil viewing shorter or spaced it out with some of the other (Native American artifacts, animals of the world, etc.) exhibits. \u00a0I would definitely go back but I would be more strategic and better prepared if I go back with my son.\nI've come here multiple times.

Their exhibitions and cinema shorts are worth viewing!\nUseful 2\nI think that I've been coming to the AMNH for more than 40 years and I am surprised that in all my visits while being an Official Yelper, that I didn't include something about this amazing place. \u00a0 I was there very recently to see their own Origami Christmas Tree as I like to include it on my \"PiercingKen\" Instagram where related images are stockpiled during this season. \u00a0 Once I was done photographing that, I explored deeper into the place and sure, while I have seen so many of the exhibits before I surely don't mind seeing them again.\nGenerally speaking, I like to tell the folks who ask me about an upcoming visit what to see first and I say go to the dinosaurs since they are on an upper floor and there is a lot of photo ops to do. \u00a0It's always my first stop and then the hall of animals is where I like to spend some time and admire the detailed setups. \u00a0During my visit there was a big T-Rex exhibit that shared a lot of the newfound knowledge about the original King Of The Beasts. \u00a0It was super interesting and I made sure to snap a number of pictures of that. \u00a0Another area I like to spend a lot of time in is where the giant blue whale is along with the other sea creatures.\nI don't generally spend much time in the sections with other cultures because its a time thing more than a lack of interest. \u00a0If you get there later than planned you should aim at the big stuff first but if you are an anthropology student of any kind then you must hit the assorted people exhibits as there is Indian, Asian and African cultures to examine that will aid your studies.\nSuggestions: \u00a0Arrive early so you can see as much as possible. \u00a0Wear comfortable shoes or sneakers as there is a LOT of walking to do. \u00a0I'd bring a couple of bottles of water and some bags of chips or energy bars along with you and be sure that your mobile devices are fully charged and you have a battery pack or the plug. \u00a0I didn't notice too many outlets to use so the battery pack is a must. \u00a0 \u00a0There is an open WiFi signal to use which is helpful and I would try to avoid going on major holidays since it will be packed. \u00a0If you are visiting my city from another country then please add this place to your itinerary. \u00a0So far I have taken visiting friends from South America and Scandinavia here and each of the groups loved it.\nThat's all I have. \u00a0Enjoy.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nI love this place! So much to see and do!\nCame during the holiday break and the place was PACKED! We still managed to look at the T-Rex exhibit, Oceans show in 3D and also the butterfly conservatory. All was thoroughly enjoyed by the kids. The place is huge so give yourself at least half a day to see all the cool things.\nWater fountains and filling stations readily available on most floors. Gift shop has pretty neat stuff to buy too.\nThere is a restaurant on site and there are also lots of eateries on Columbus Circle.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n1 check-in\nThis is a lovely museum! I am such a NY n00blet that I realized that the entrance cost can be a \"suggested\" price (although you might be stuck in a long line if you're not buying a ticket via online or kiosk). However, there is a set price for some extra activities in the museum.\nI've enjoyed my little walk in this museum and personally love the animal exhibits. They look so life like! The short information some of the exhibit has is perfect for someone like me who prefers to \"look\" than \"read\" in museums. I hope to come back and try to actually do their activities.\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n24\nBy Ruggy J.\nBy Mason A.\nBy Libby R.\nBy Diana T.\n,\n"

No matter what the cause, stress floods your body with hormones. Your heart pounds, your breathing speeds up, and your muscles tense.\nThis so-called \"stress response\" is a normal reaction to threatening situations, honed in our prehistory to help us survive threats like an animal attack or a flood. Today, we rarely face these physical dangers, but challenging situations in daily life can set off the stress response. We can't avoid all sources of stress in our lives, nor would we want to. But we can develop healthier ways of responding to them.\nOne way is to invoke the \"relaxation response,\" through a technique first developed in the 1970s at Harvard Medical School by cardiologist Dr. Herbert Benson, editor of the Harvard Medical School Special Health Report Stress Management: Approaches for preventing and reducing stress. The relaxation response is the opposite of the stress response. It's a state of profound rest that can be elicited in many ways. With regular practice, you create a well of calm to dip into as the need arises.\nFollowing are six relaxation techniques that can help you evoke the relaxation response and reduce stress.\n1. Breath focus. In this simple, powerful technique, you take long, slow, deep breaths (also known as abdominal or belly breathing). As you breathe, you gently disengage your mind from distracting thoughts and sensations. Breath focus can be especially helpful for people with eating disorders to help them focus on their bodies in a more positive way. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those with health problems that make breathing difficult, such as respiratory ailments or heart failure.\n2. Body scan. This technique blends breath focus with progressive muscle relaxation. After a few minutes of deep breathing, you focus on one part of the body or group of muscles at a time and mentally releasing any physical tension you feel there. A body scan can help boost your awareness of the mind-body connection. If you have had a recent surgery that affects your body image or other difficulties with body image, this technique may be less helpful for you.\n3. Guided imagery. For this technique, you conjure up soothing scenes, places, or experiences in your mind to help you relax and focus. You can find free apps and online recordings of calming scenes\u2014just make sure to choose imagery you find soothing and that has personal significance. Guided imagery may help you reinforce a positive vision of yourself, but it can be difficult for those who have intrusive thoughts or find it hard to conjure up mental images.\n4. Mindfulness meditation. This practice involves sitting comfortably, focusing on your breathing, and bringing your mind's attention to the present moment without drifting into concerns about the past or the future. This form of meditation has enjoyed increasing popularity in recent years. Research suggests it may be helpful for people with anxiety, depression, and pain.\n5. Yoga, tai chi, and qigong. These three ancient arts combine rhythmic breathing with a series of postures or flowing movements. The physical aspects of these practices offer a mental focus that can help distract you from racing thoughts. They can also enhance your flexibility and balance. But if you are not normally active, have health problems, or a painful or disabling condition, these relaxation techniques might be too challenging. Check with your doctor before starting them.\n6. Repetitive prayer. For this technique, you silently repeat a short prayer or phrase from a prayer while practicing breath focus. This method may be especially appealing if religion or spirituality is meaningful to you.\nRather than choosing just one technique, experts recommend sampling several to see which one works best for you. Try to practice for at least 20 minutes a day, although even just a few minutes can help. But the longer and the more often you practice these relaxation techniques, the greater the benefits and the more you can reduce stress.\nImage: \u00a9 Robert Kneschke | Dreamstime.com\nDisclaimer:\nAs a service to our readers, Harvard Health Publishing provides access to our library of archived content.

            "by: Inner IDEA\nMeditation is an approach to training the mind, similar to the way that fitness is an approach to training the body. But many meditation techniques exist \u2014 so how do you learn how to meditate?\n\u201cIn Buddhist tradition, the word \u2018meditation\u2019 is equivalent to a word like \u2018sports\u2019 in the U.S. It\u2019s a family of activities, not a single thing,\u201d University of Wisconsin neuroscience lab director Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D., told The New York Times. And different meditation practices require different mental skills.\nIt\u2019s extremely difficult for a beginner to sit for hours and think of nothing or have an \u201cempty mind.\u201d We have some tools such as a beginner meditation DVD or a brain-sensing headband to help you through this process when you are starting out. In general, the easiest way to begin meditating is by focusing on the breath \u2014 an example of one of the most common approaches to meditation: concentration.\nConcentration meditation\nConcentration meditation involves focusing on a single point. This could entail following the breath, repeating a single word or mantra, staring at a candle flame, listening to a repetitive gong, or counting beads on a mala. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations.\nIn this form of meditation, you simply refocus your awareness on the chosen object of attention each time you notice your mind wandering. Rather than pursuing random thoughts, you simply let them go. Through this process, your ability to concentrate improves.\nMindfulness meditation\nMindfulness meditation encourages the practitioner to observe wandering thoughts as they drift through the mind. The intention is not to get involved with the thoughts or to judge them, but simply to be aware of each mental note as it arises.\nThrough mindfulness meditation, you can see how your thoughts and feelings tend to move in particular patterns. Over time, you can become more aware of the human tendency to quickly judge an experience as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. With practice, an inner balance develops.\nIn some schools of meditation, students practice a combination of concentration and mindfulness. Many disciplines call for stillness \u2014 to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the teacher.\nOther meditation techniques\nThere are various other meditation techniques. For example, a daily meditation practice among Buddhist monks focuses directly on the cultivation of compassion. This involves envisioning negative events and recasting them in a positive light by transforming them through compassion. There are also moving meditation techniques, such as tai chi, qigong, and walking meditation .\nBenefits of meditation\nIf relaxation is not the goal of meditation, it is often a result. In the 1970s, Herbert Benson, MD, a researcher at Harvard University Medical School, coined the term \u201crelaxation response\" after conducting research on people who practiced transcendental meditation. The relaxation response, in Benson\u2019s words, is \u201can opposite, involuntary response that causes a reduction in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.\u201d\nSince then, studies on the relaxation response have documented the following short-term benefits to the nervous system:\nLower blood pressure\nImproved blood circulation\nLower heart rate\nLess stress\nDeeper relaxation\nContemporary researchers are now exploring whether a consistent meditation practice yields long-term benefits, and noting positive effects on brain and immune function among meditators. Yet it\u2019s worth repeating that the purpose of meditation is not to achieve benefits. To put it as an Eastern philosopher may say, the goal of meditation is no goal. It\u2019s simply to be present.\nIn Buddhist philosophy, the ultimate benefit of meditation is liberation of the mind from attachment to things it cannot control, such as external circumstances or strong internal emotions. The liberated or \u201cenlightened\u201d practitioner no longer needlessly follows desires or clings to experiences, but instead maintains a calm mind and sense of inner harmony.\nHow to meditate: Simple meditation for beginners\nThis meditation exercise is an excellent introduction to meditation techniques.\nSit or lie comfortably. You may even want to invest in a meditation chair or cushion .\nClose your eyes. We recommend using one of our Cooling Eye Masks or Restorative Eye Pillows if lying down.\nMake no effort to control the breath; simply breathe naturally.\nFocus your attention on the breath and on how the body moves with each inhalation and exhalation. Notice the movement of your body as you breathe. Observe your chest, shoulders, rib cage, and belly. Simply focus your attention on your breath without controlling its pace or intensity. If your mind wanders, return your focus back to your breath.\nMaintain this meditation practice for two to three minutes to start, and then try it for longer periods.\nAlso in Discover\nBased on recent studies, dogs have been found to not only bring us joy and fulfillment but\u00a0also increase longevity.\nSign up to get the latest on sales, new releases and more \u2026\nSocial\n"

We're talking about a full spa day with all the works. There's nothing like a long massage with aromatherapy, wraps, facials and more to put your mind and body at ease.\nSure, you can head to one of Singapore's nearby islands or do a day trip away from the city. But sometimes time and money are tight, so it's perhaps more manageable to block off a few hours in your day and check in to one of these spas to treat yourself and get seriously pampered. No time or energy to go out? Check out these mobile beauty services that'll come to you instead.\nCity Hall\nWhen you're hustling it hard in the city, there's nothing like a relaxing spa session to wind down and soothe your worries. Located in Suntec City, The Thai Spa is the perfect place to escape to after work. Traditional therapy, ancient rituals and aromatherapy combine to bring you an authentic experience that will help revitalise and rejuvenate the body.\nTreatment to try\nTry\u00a0the couple massage with a complimentary rose honey milk bath in a private jacuzzi ($198 for one hour) and traditional Thai-style massage ($79 per hour) to bust those muscle and joint aches.\u00a0 Some of its highly recommended therapy treatments\u00a0include the peppermint body scrub, Thai reflexology, Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, Balinese massage, Lomi Lomi massage, body polishing and several slimming therapies.\nThe Thai Spa also specialises in organic and herbal facials ($79) which include extraction and a Thai herbal face mask.\u00a0 On top of the stellar treatments, making sure customers have an amazing spa experience is also important to the team. To ensure ultimate privacy, each therapy room also comes with a private shower.\nCity Hall\nThe revamped Ritz-Carlton Spa is an underwater-themed oasis for the worn-out folks \u2013 calming blue lights are surrounded by lush greenery, with the sounds of nature being piped throughout the 10-room spa. It\u2019s the first La Mer hotel partner spa in Asia Pacific so naturally, La Mer products take centre stage.\nTreatment to try\nIf you have difficult knots in your back that's hard to soften, you might want to try a bamboo massage ($280 for 90 minutes). The use of bamboo sticks and Ayurvedic techniques to massage and assist with stretching, joint mobility and improving joint flexibility will leave you feeling relaxed and invigorated. Need some music in the background? Try the Cello Concerto\u00a0($400) experience where your body massage is accompanied with live\u00a0tunes played by a cellist.\nBishan\nA spa that punches above the other heartland ones in its vicinity, Aramsa is a little hard to find as it\u2019s located in the middle of sprawling Bishan Park \u2013 definitely schedule some extra time on the commute here. Aesthetics-wise, this spa in a garden is impressive \u2013 it features 17 elegantly designed treatment rooms, each with individual outdoor courtyards that boast their own outdoor showers or therapeutic hydrotherapy baths set against a jungle backdrop (you have to book a bath treatment to get to use it).\nTreatment to try\nTry their organic and herb-based massages, exfoliations, wraps and facials, detox with their mineral mud body wraps or go for water therapy sessions with mineral garden baths or rainforest showers. The Signature Garden Packages features packages of three or four therapies conducted over 150 minutes to work dry and mature skin, or restore the energy in sapped and stressed bodies.\nTiong Bahru\nIn the\u00a0cool neighbourhood Tiong Bahru is a spa seemingly geared towards couples: two out of four treatment rooms, plus the hot tub in the back for bath therapies like The Milky Way ($55 for 30min) and Heaven and Herb ($55 for 30 min), are for duos. The d\u00e9cor: The facade and receiving area are decorated with cool industrial-looking containers, while inside is more traditional: a palette of browns and burgundies offset by Thai silk pillows and wall decals of flowers and birds.\nTreatment to try\nSpa-standards like Thai, Balinese, Swedish and foot massages, as well as the 90-minute Sculptor\u2019s Handiwork that combines a stint under cold wrap with a firm massage to combat cellulite. Food-themed body scrubs and masks are also a feature with choices like Wine and Dine ($59 for 45 min) \u2013 a nutrient-rich mixture of red wine, nourishing oils, vitamin E, white milk and clay said to improve circulation, and Magic Mushrooms ($59 for 45 min) \u2013 which applies lingzhi and shiitake to regenerate and protect skin.\nProbably the closest to a public bath in Singapore, this independent spa complex is reminiscent of a Chinese hot springs resort. Upon entering, you\u2019re directed to either the men\u2019s or women\u2019s side and given a locker \u2013 swimming trunks, robes and towels are provided, so there\u2019s no need to bring anything. The locker rooms have a hot pool (plus a cold pool for the men \u2013 it supposedly improves circulation), sauna and showers. In the common areas, you can relax on comfy couches with personal TV screens, plus there\u2019s an all-you-can eat buffet throughout the day, making it quite easy to spend a full day here (and well worth the basic $68 entry price).\nTreatment to try\nGateway to Vitality (members $122/one hour, non-members $155/one hour). The spa\u2019s standard deep-tissue massage uses Shiatsu-style techniques \u2013 you can choose to use oil for a smoother, more relaxing treatment, or non-oil for more direct pressure-point massage. The price includes free roam of the spa\u2019s facilities and buffet. Plus, it is open all day and all night.\nKallang\nYunomori Onsen and Spa is the first in South-East Asia to combine an authentic Japanese hot spring experience with traditional Thai massages. Which is great, as onsen baths themselves relieve muscular tension, improve blood circulation and skin health, or so its proponents claim.\u00a0There are five (surprisingly high-tech) onsen baths offered at the separate male and female onsen areas here: soda, silk, bubble, jet and cold bath. Each pool is treated with hot spring minerals imported from the Land of the Rising Sun, and their temperatures are carefully monitored at all times. But we'd recommend you start with the CO2-filled soda bath \u2013 it's set at around 38.5 to 39.5\u00b0C \u2013 and work your way up.\nThe entry price of $38 grants you all-day access to the onsen, steam rooms and sauna (guys, you're in luck \u2013 there are hot baths and a sauna that are exclusive to the male onsen area). Prior to entering, you're given fresh towels and a yukata of your choosing to lounge in between dips. You'll have to enjoy the onsen in your birthday suit, but if you're too shy, Yunomori offers black nylon disposable underwear. Think of it as a blurry filter \u2013 they're not completely opaque, but hey, it\u2019s better than nothing. And be sure to shower before entering the onsen pools (with complimentary Yunomori spa products) and try to keep your hair clear of the onsen waters. So hold off on diving right in.\nPick your desired package (see below for our recommendation) and receive an electronic tag. It's got your assigned locker number on it and works as a 'credit card' to use at the Yunomori caf\u00e9. The caf\u00e9 whips up simple Japanese dishes such as soba sets ($10.80) that come with potato salad and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 an onsen egg. There's also free flow hot ginger tea and cold hojicha tea all day.\nTreatment to try\nOpt for the package deal: in addition to the onsen, you can enjoy a 30-minute Thai foot massage or a 60-minute full-body one ($68-$118) by a skilled masseuse. You have to fill in a form before clambering on the table to indicate any areas of concern to focus on and the desired pressure. Bells and whistles such as a hot compress or aroma oil therapy ($196-$246)\u00a0can also be added to your basic package as and when you please.\nKallang\nRevamped in 2013, this spa at PARKROYAL on Beach Road\u2019s new annexe features a rooftop pool, a jacuzzi, a bar serving healthy cocktails and spa cuisine, as well as a gym and fitness room that you can enjoy. With a total of seven treatment rooms (including one for couples) available to book, St Gregory at PARKROYAL on Beach Road specialises in skin treatments using clinically trialled skincare products by British brand Elemis, and has in-house Traditional Chinese Medicine physicians and masseurs to diagnose and alleviate most common bodily complaints.\nTreatment to try\nTraditional Chinese tui na massage ($180/60 minutes). Combining the techniques of massage and acupressure as practiced in ancient China, such as pushing, pulling and kneading, the spa therapy session will stimulate key pressure points in the body to relief tension and increase your 'qi' energy.\nStep into the lift at The Westin Singapore and you\u2019ll be taken straight up to heaven \u2013 the hotel\u2019s Heavenly Spa, that is. Located 35 floors above the ground and boasting spectacular views of the CBD and Chinatown, it\u2019s definitely not a bad place to clear your head and unwind. The spa has six rooms \u2013 one of which is a couple suite \u2013 that are decked out with minimalistic d\u00e9cor in soothing, earthy tones. Guests are advised to arrive early to take advantage of the other facilities in the gender-segregated changing rooms, including an Experiential Shower (choose between the hot \u2018tropical\u2019 and cold \u2018glacier\u2019 modes), a steam room, and a whirlpool filled with very hot water. After your treatment, feel free to stay awhile longer in the relaxation lounge to nibble on dried fruits and nuts while browsing through magazines.\nTreatment to try\nLavender\u2019s often regarded for its relaxing properties, and the 90-minute Lavender Spa Journey ($250/single and $450/couple) does just that. It starts with a hydrating scrub made from pure sweet almond oil, natural sea salt and therapeutic lavender essential oils aimed at improving circulation. You\u2019re then given time in-between to rinse yourself in the adjoining shower, before being treated to a 60-minute massage with yet more lavender oil. The scent never overpowers, though, and your masseuse adjusts the pressure of the massage accordingly to ease bodily tension and encourage complete relaxation of the mind. In fact, you\u2019ll likely drift to sleep and awaken feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.\nOr pick the spa\u2019s signature\u00a0Revitalize Massage ($160/60 mins; $220/90 mins)\u00a0that combines techniques drawn from three cultures \u2013 Chinese, Malay and Indian, in that order. The masseuse starts off by releasing the tension in the shoulders and back by targeting meridian points, followed by a gentle abdomen massage. To round off the treatment, a metallic Kansu bowl is rolled around your soles, which is said to dispel body heat, leaving you feeling both relaxed and energised.\nOrchard\nDecadence is the name of the game at Remede\u2019s first branch in Asia. Located on the hushed end of the Orchard Road stretch, this place takes the relaxing experience up a notch with exotic teas, bubbly champagnes and floral-scented chocolates from the hotel\u2019s LaBrezza restaurant. Filled with steam chambers, a Finnish dry heat sauna, a Vichy shower, a hydro massage pool and a peaceful outdoor hot whirlpool. What\u00a0it lacks in space for outdoor cabanas and sweeping pools like other spas, it makes up for with indulgent amenities. There's the\u00a0Pedi:Mani:Cure Studio by Bastian Gonzalez (for you to pamper your nails as well \u2013 it\u2019s worth it, trust us), and the spa\u2019s treatments include body scrubs, cooling facials, customised massages or facials, body wraps and more.\nIf you're thinking of a staycation, they have packages available (depending on time with price upon request), which include spa treatments or complimentary vouchers.\nTreatment to try\nSt Regis Signature Warm Rassoul Wrap ($230/one hour). Start off\u00a0with a body brush, then lather up with warm, orange blossom-scented Rassoul \u2013 a type of mud renowned for mineralising and moisturising effects. As you relax on a warm marble slab while wrapped in cotton muslin, you\u2019ll be treated to a gentle argan oil facial massage, followed by a Vichy shower.\nSentosa\nDefinitely one of the funkier spas we've checked out, the rainforest-inspired AWAY Spa, in W Singapore, oozes trendiness and elegance all at once. The massage rooms are bathed in a unique, soothing blue light, and each comes with its own private outdoor shower. Guests can also make use of the many facilities, such as the warm vitality pool in the decompression area (complete with a hydro back bench and jet features) and a fun, experiential shower called Aqua, which has options like Tropical Storm and Cold Mist \u2013 with various water settings and light effects to match. Choose from treatments like customised massages, the luminous crystal facial, a bust-reviving therapy to lift, firm and tone, a cleansing and exfoliating facial for men, and even a tension-easing massage for sports buffs.\nTreatment to try\nAWAY Body Treat ($380/two hours). Using products from UK-based company Ila-Spa, the treatment starts off with an exfoliating body scrub with Himalayan salt crystals and a body mud wrap, while the second part involves an invigorating tension-reducing massage. A special soundtrack by Ila is played throughout the session to complement the long, gentle movements of the masseuse.\nThe 10,000-square-metre space houses a series of hot and cold facilities, including a Japanese-style onsen set on the edge of small jungle, a crystal steam room, gymnasium, yoga studio and Tangerine serving up healthy cuisine by chef Ian Kittichai. On top of soothing massages and stress-relief rituals, ESPA's staff include a naturopath trained to deliver useful advice on living and eating healthier, as well as perky gym trainers who conduct classes in their impressively kitted-out workout room. Patrons who purchase treatments worth more than $200 are welcome to use the various pools and exercise classes.\nESPA's after-treatment facilities are also unrivalled. Thoughtful extras like the special spin dryer that whirls your swim suit dry, and the sleeping room with pods to take a nap in after your treatment \u2013 don't you hate abruptly navigating the bustle of public transportation after a massage? \u2013 are compelling arguments to go to ESPA and make a whole day of it.\nTreatment to try\nThe Day Spa Retreat ($380/Mon-Thu, $450/Fri-Sun). Centred around themes 'Fit for Life', 'Weight Management', 'Intro to Detox' and 'De-stress', this package is a good primer to ESPA as a lifestyle destination, and includes a consultation with a lifestyle or fitness staff member and two treatments: one 60 minutes and another 45 minutes long (try the Indulgence Hammam Ritual, a Turkish bath ritual in Singapore\u2019s first hammam steam facility). The package also includes a two-course meal at Tangerine, with a menu that recommends dishes based on the retreat you\u2019ve enjoyed.\nSentosa\nNourish your body, mind and spirit at this award-winning spa nestled in the quiet confines of Capella Singapore. Keeping a sharp focus on all things natural and organic \u2013 it\u2019s the only spa to use products from The Organic Pharmacy \u2013 the space features nine cosy treatment rooms (each with a private alfresco garden), two of which are couple suites and one that offers traditional Asian remedies.\nAfter your session, you can wander around (the staff are extremely polite and keep out of your way to give you privacy) to use the other facilities. The spa's hot and cold wet facilities include a herbal steam room, an ice fountain to cool down after a heated treatment, an experience shower, and a calming vitality pool for neck and full-body water massages. Other facilities include a relaxation lounge with unique 'sound wave' chairs (where you can recline, sip tea, munch on nuts and read magazines for as long as you want) and a fitness centre with private instructors on hand. Treatments include stimulating Balinese, Thai and Shiatsu massages, couple spa experiences, soothing therapies for mums-to-be, body-sculpting sessions, body exfoliations and wraps, facials, manicures, and many more.\nTreatment to try\nSenja Sunyi Massage ($250/90 mins). This soothing treatment uses rose and pomegranate body balm plus warm \u2018moon stones\u2019 with tui na and Javanese massage techniques to untangle your nerves and remove muscle kinks. You can ask for light, medium or strong pressure, and your therapist will gladly oblige.\nCity Hall\nAn elegant, serene space, the spa offers a luxurious wellness experience with facilities like experience showers, saunas, steam rooms, a communal relaxation room, treatment areas and a spa concierge with consultation booths. Find your inner peace with treatments like fragrant baths, full body massages and head massages in the privacy of your own suite, or try their therapeutic or bamboo massages, jet lag or after sun treatments, specialised facials and even half day spa programmes like Asian-inspired therapies or relaxing treats for expectant mothers.\nTreatment to try\nTaste of the Orient ($510/170 minutes). Revitalise your senses with a combination of a welcome foot ritual, a full body scrub with ginger and mandarin scents and sea salt and almond oil, a full body Oriental bamboo massage to ease the tension and finally, an Oriental foot therapy session.\nSentosa\nPreviously Spa Botanica at The Sentosa Singapore, A Beaufort Hotel, this destination spa has been f\u00eated and loved for its indoor and outdoor rejuvenation facilities. Rebranded in mid-2014, a whole host of new rejuvenating treatments grounded in French cosmetology practices are now in place, with the treatment menu sectioned into appetisers, mains and desserts to help patrons mix and match their indulgences.\nTreatment to try\nStarter selections, for example, feature quick essential body oil scrubs and facials ($100-$120/30-45min), and Mains consist of longer sessions filled with multi-step facials and body massages borrowing wisdom from India, Thailand and the Orient ($180-$240/60-90min). The spa\u2019s beloved volcanic mud seating areas, waterfalls, pools and meditation labyrinths are still also in place, as are its mini-bungalow-like Couple Spa Suites ($80/30min).\nCity Hall\nOne of the more serious spa spaces in a hotel here, the Willow Stream Spa is an amenity-rich sanctuary located in the centre of town. A total of 35 treatment rooms deliver treatments grounded in Eastern and Western spa philosophies, alongside an array of fitness facilities, sauna and steam rooms, swimming pools and even tennis courts \u2013 all are spread over three levels and 50,000 square feet of floor space. Another plus for Willow Stream are the innovative weekly classes like aqua aerobics and helipad yoga (conducted on Swissotel the Stamford\u2019s rooftop and open to the public), which offer access to the spa\u2019s facilities on the day of the class.\nTreatment to try\nPower of the Sea ($249/90 minutes). Designed to detoxify and nourish skin, this treatment harnesses the goodness of sea minerals in a wrap and a jet bath in sea salt. The finish of a marine firming creme leaves the skin feeling especially luscious.\nRaffles Place\nLocated above Farrer Park MRT station, One Farrer Hotel and Spa offers an Olympic size outdoor pool, a spa, suites and villas to cater to all business- and leisure-seekers. There are five dining options in the hotel \u2013 feast on international delights at the all-day restaurant Escape, pick up a quick meal at Local, Fresh and Seasonal Deli, chill out at the poolside cafe Flip Flop and drink up at Sunset Bar. A stone's throw away is the 24-hour iconic Singapore institution Mustafa Centre and City Square Mall.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Hot Springs, Hotels On August 16, 2018 No Comments\nHappy Soaking in Mineral-Rich Waters\nText and Photos: Vision\nAfter a typical travel day involving walks from tourist attraction to tourist attraction, your feet \u2013 if not your whole body \u2013 have most likely earned the right to some prolonged pampering. Immersing yourself in water with the perfect temperature \u2013 not too hot, not too cool, 39 degrees Celsius perhaps \u2013 is one of the simplest and most enjoyable pleasures. Experience how your stress, fatigue, and strains magically disperse with a soak in soothing hot-spring water.\nBeing a land located on the infamous Ring of Fire that surrounds the Pacific Ocean, Taiwan is prone to receiving jolts from the depths of the Earth, sometimes with devastating results. But where earthquakes occur, mineral hot springs are likely to be present, and Taiwan is blessed with an abundance of them. From north to south, from coastal regions up into the mountains, are hot springs found in a wide variety of often strikingly scenic natural settings. Hot-spring bathing in Taiwan can be as simple as creating your own makeshift pool in or beside a mountain stream at a spot where hot-spring water emerges from the ground, and as elaborate as taking advantage of a fully equipped spa facility inside a luxurious hotel.\nTaiwan\u2019s hot springs are not all of the same type. The water temperature at the source, for example, can differ significantly, from cooler to boiling hot, and the water at each location can contain a range of different minerals, a number of which have therapeutic properties.\nWith so much choice available, it\u2019s helpful to have some guidance \u2013 a ranking, perhaps, that can help you decide where to go next for a relaxing soak. Luckily, earlier this year the Taiwan Tourism Bureau compiled a list of the best hot-spring areas on the island after conducting a survey, supplemented with evaluation by a team of experts. Following are short descriptions of the top 10 hot-spring areas on that list.\nNamed the very best of the lot, the hot-spring resort village of Guanziling, in the mountains of southern Taiwan, is a worthy representative of all hot-spring locations around the island. It combines many of the elements that make hot-spring bathing so popular and attractive here. The location and setting are ideal. The village is close enough to a city (Chiayi) and major transportation hubs (the city\u2019s high-speed rail and regular rail stations) to be conveniently reached. At the same time, it is far enough from the hustle and bustle of a city so that you can enjoy quiet relaxation, immersed in the embrace of eye-pleasing verdant mountains.\nGuanziling\u2019s hot-spring establishments range from simple to luxurious, and quality food can be enjoyed at hotel restaurants as well as at other village eateries. What makes the hot springs of Guanziling especially popular is the mud, which gives the waters a distinct gray color and is said to be effective in treating ailments such as skin allergies, rheumatism, and arthritis. Spa operators often provide buckets of mud by their pools so that bathers can cover themselves with the smooth substance from head to toe, adding fun to the hot-spring experience. One of the premier hot-spring resort hotels at Guanziling is the European-style The King\u2019s Garden Villa.\nRead more about Guanziling an the Siraya National Scenic Area in Charming Siraya National Scenic Area .\nMud spring water soaking\nThe King\u2019s Garden Villa\nThis is a complex, not a stand-alone hotel building \u2013 a configuration of wood cottages and two-floor wood-fa\u00e7ade buildings. In the latter you walk directly into your room from outside, and the second-floor units are set up like walk-up apartments. The complex has the look and ambience of a small, densely-knit European mountain village, everything is painted bright white, and the facades and cozy park-like walkways between buildings are spic and span. The management shows obvious pride in every detail, which guests in turn obviously notice and appreciate. Each unit has hot-spring tubs in a room partially exposed to the outside, though designed to ensure privacy. The resort is at the top of Guanziling, with only forest, ridge, and peaks behind, though not all units have views in this direction. There is also a large and airy spa facility, with an attractive outdoor pool with a partial mountain view, sauna facilities, mineral pools of various temperatures, and other amenities. Guanziling\u2019s famous health-enhancing mineral mud is available here. Note that there are public facilities as well as separate men\u2019s/women\u2019s facilities.\nThe King\u2019s Garden Villa\nThe King\u2019s Garden Villa (\u666f\u5927\u6e21\u5047\u838a\u5712)\nAdd: No. 56, Guanziling, Baihe District, Tainan City\n(\u53f0\u5357\u5e02\u767d\u6cb3\u5340\u95dc\u5b50\u5dba56\u865f)\nGuan-Zih-Ling Toong Mao Spa Resort\nThe\u00a0Guan-Zih-Ling Toong Mao Spa Resort is right on Guanziling\u2019s main thoroughfare, and guests are constantly walking in and out, heading off to or coming back from a round of town shopping and/or eating. The hotel is built on a slight slope, and the basement area opens up to the large outdoor swimming pool, hidden from street view. People lounge around on the wide ceramic-tile deck area, reading and relaxing. The pool is in full view of a roomy basement caf\u00e9 where guests lounge about in bathrobes, reading and chatting. People, in pairs and small groups, head past caf\u00e9 and swimming pool to the hot-spring pools beyond, which have a tree-shaded, partial mountain view. On one side of the basement caf\u00e9 is the indoor spa complex, which has private rooms, and on the other side is the well-equipped \u2013 and well-soundproofed \u2013 games arcade. Up on the ground-floor level are large VIP rooms from which boisterous karaoke singing will emanate at night. All guestrooms are in the back section of the hotel, ensuring overnight guests\u2019 quiet and mountain views. Not all these rooms have hot-spring tubs; the tubs are on the balcony in those that do, providing soothing green-covered mountain views.\nHot-spring fun at the Guan-Zih-Ling Toong Mao Spa Resort\nGuan-Zih-Ling Toong Mao Spa Resort (\u95dc\u5b50\u5dba\u7d71\u8302\u6eab\u6cc9\u6703\u9928)\nAdd: No. 28, Guanziling, Baihe District, Tainan City\n(\u53f0\u5357\u5e02\u767d\u6cb3\u5340\u95dc\u5b50\u5dba28\u865f)\nWater temperature (at source): About 75 degrees Celsius\nPublic transport: Take a bus from either the Chiayi or Xinying railway stations (conventional trains) or THSR Chiayi Station (high-speed trains)\nMore information: www.siraya-nsa.gov.tw (Siraya National Scenic Area)\nPlaces of interest\nWater and Fire Crevice\nA short drive from Guanziling is the Water and Fire Crevice. Methane and boiling-hot mineral water \u2013 and mud \u2013 pour forth from a cliff-face fissure here, and the methane has been ignited. Water and flame seem to magically mix together, in a paradoxical phenomenon locals long ago dubbed \u201cfire in water and water in fire.\u201d The flames, today about a meter high, once shot out about three meters, and have licked the grotto black.\nWater and Fire Crevice\nBiyun Temple\nOrnate Biyun Temple, the \u201cTemple of Azure Clouds,\u201d is close by. The temple is by roadside, and the temple complex climbs up a soaring, steep mountainside. The Jianan Plain is spread out far left to far right before you, as though you\u2019re sitting in a theater watching a widescreen movie. You\u2019ll see many monks on-site, and unusual practices such as exorcisms are common. In the temple\u2019s rear is a dragon sculpture on a cliff-side wall from which sacred, drinkable mineral water trickles, eagerly bottled by local tourists.\nBiyun Temple\nBeitou (Taipei City)\nBeitou is a district of Taipei City, and as such by far the most conveniently reached hot-spring resort area in Taiwan. It takes just half an hour or so by MRT (Taipei Metro) to get from Taipei Main Station to Beitou\u2019s hot-spring hotel area (just beyond MRT Xinbeitou Station). This is a fine place not just to go for a hot-spring soak, but also to learn about the history of hot-spring bathing in Beitou and Taiwan. Be sure to visit the Beitou Hot Spring Museum and Beitou Museum. Another must-visit tourist attraction is Thermal Valley, a mist-covered hot-spring pond, which is one of the area\u2019s main hot-spring sources. Beitou has a wide range of hot-spring bathing options, from the Beitou Park Outdoor Hot Spring Bathing Pool complex to modern upscale resort operations such as the Grand View Resort Beitou.\nHot-spring pool at Grand View Resort Beitou Hotel\nGrand View Resort Beitou Hotel (\u5317\u6295\u9e97\u79a7\u6eab\u6cc9\u9152\u5e97)\nAdd: No. 30, Youya Rd., Beitou Dist., Taipei City\n(\u53f0\u5317\u5e02\u5317\u6295\u5340\u5e7d\u96c5\u8def 30 \u865f)\nTel: (02) 2898-8888\n(\u53f0\u5317\u5e02\u5317\u6295\u5340\u5149\u660e\u8def258\u865f)\nAdd: No. 31, Youya Rd., Beitou District, Taipei City\n(\u53f0\u5317\u5e02\u5317\u6295\u5340\u5e7d\u96c5\u8def31\u865f)\nHot-spring type: White sulfur and green sulfur springs\nWater temperature (at source): 40~99 degrees Celsius\nPublic transport: Take the Taipei MRT Tamsui-Xinyi Line to Beitou Station, transfer to the Xinbeitou Line, and get off at Xinbeitou Station.\nMore information: www.travel.taipei (Travel Taipei)\nPlaces to Visit\nThermal Valley\nAt the far, upper end of the hot-spring park, look left and you\u2019ll spot the entrance to Thermal Valley, the source of the park area\u2019s sulfurous hot-spring water. Surrounded by trees, this deep, rock-strewn depression was created long ago by a volcanic burst. The sulfurous waters in the depression\u2019s large pool bubble and spit, the steam sometimes filling the entire little valley on cool days. The Ketagalan people who once lived in the area called the valley \u201cPatauw,\u201d meaning \u201cwitch\u201d or \u201csorceress.\u201d \u201cBeitou\u201d is a bastardization of this original name.\nThermal Valley in Beitou\nBeitou Museum\nFurther uphill from the hot-spring park and the thermal-spring valley, on Youya Road, is the Beitou Museum ( www.beitoumuseum.org.tw ), an excellent place to learn more about Beitou\u2019s history, indigenous culture, and the Japanese colonial era \u2013 the museum building was original constructed in 1921 as a fancy hot-spring hotel for the Japanese elite \u2013 and also to taste fine cuisine (Kaiseki-style) and take in irregular cultural performances (in a spacious tatami room).\nBeitou Museum\nBeitou Video\nJiaoxi (Yilan County)\nIt takes only about an hour by intercity bus to get from downtown Taipei to Jiaoxi, a small hot-spring town in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan. From Jiaoxi\u2019s bus or railway station it\u2019s a short walk to Tangweigou Park, where you\u2019ll find simple public hot-spring bath facilities, including pavilions with hot-spring foot-bath pools. If you want to go soaking in a more luxurious environment, there is no shortage of stylish resort hotels in and around town, including the elegant Hotel Royal Chiaohsi. Besides soaking in the soothing mineral waters, when spending time in Jiaoxi you\u2019ll also want to go for an easy hike to the beautiful Wufengqi Waterfall.\nJiaoxi Hot Spring Park Forest Furo\nKilin Jiaoxi hotel\nKilin Jiaoxi (\u7901\u6eaa\u9e92\u9e9f)\nAdd: No. 116, Sec. 5, Jiaoxi Rd., Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County\n(\u5b9c\u862d\u7e23\u7901\u6eaa\u9109\u7901\u6eaa\u8def\u4e94\u6bb5116\u865f)\nGuan Xiang Century Resort Hotel (\u51a0\u7fd4\u4e16\u7d00\u6eab\u6cc9\u6703\u9928)\nAdd: No. 6, Ln. 66, Ren\u2019ai Rd., Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County\u00a0City\n(\u5b9c\u862d\u7e23\u7901\u6eaa\u9109\u4ec1\u611b\u8def66\u5df76\u865f)\nAdd: No. 6, Deyang Rd., Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County\u00a0City\n(\u5b9c\u862d\u7e23\u7901\u6eaa\u9109\u5fb7\u967d\u8def6\u865f)\nWater temperature (at source): About 64 degrees Celsius\nPublic transport: From Taipei, take an intercity bus from either Taipei Bus Station or Taipei City Hall Bus Station, or take an eastbound train that stops at Jiaoxi.\nMore information: travel.yilan.tw (Yilan Tourism)\nPlace to Visit\nWufengqi Waterfalls\nOf all the attractions in the Jiaoxi area, however, perhaps none are more popular than the three-tier Wufengqi Waterfalls a couple of kilometers west of the town, which are not only spectacular but also very easy to visit. Visitors without their own transport are in luck, thanks to the Taiwan Tourist Shuttle Bus service ( www.taiwantrip.com.tw ), the Jiaoxi Route of which connects the waterfall area with Jiaoxi Railway Station.\u00a0 From the Wufengqi Scenic Area stop, in a large car park beside a wide stream, follow the waterside path upstream for a few minutes to a set of steps that takes you up to a rest area with a cluster of snack vendors and washroom facilities. Just beyond this point a wide stone path leads, in just a couple of minutes, to the first of the three beautiful waterfalls. Climb the steps through the gorge past the small but pretty cascade, and just above it is the second fall, a higher and more impressive leap. From here it\u2019s another 10-minute climb up steps to the third and last fall, along a path cut into the rocky, sheer-sided gorge. It\u2019s a steep push in parts, but the reward is a view of the highest and most impressive of the three waterfalls. Unfortunately, the path to this waterfall is sometimes closed due to the risk of falling rocks; but if open, it\u2019s well worth the climb to see the spectacular 40-meter-high plunge.\nJiaoxi Video\nZhiben (Taitung County)\nLocated a short drive south of Taitung City in southeastern Taiwan, the Zhiben hot-spring resort area is located in the scenic Zhiben River valley. Like many hot-spring areas in Taiwan, Zhiben was developed during the Japanese colonial area, and eventually became one of the biggest tourist draws in eastern Taiwan. Apart from enjoyment of the hot-spring hotel facilities, notably those at the grand Hotel Royal Chihpen, be sure to tackle the pathways in the Zhiben National Forest Recreation Area, where you will be surrounded by lush forest, singing birds, and roaming macaques. Especially impressive here are the magnificent white-bark banyan trees.\nZhiben River valley\nHotel Royal Chihpen\nThe Hotel Royal Chihpen is Zhiben\u2019s No. 1 accommodation selection. Up on a hillside, it is hidden away in the forest, invisible from the main hot-spring resort area. Among its many first-rate facilities is an array of open-air spa-soak choices and swimming pool tucked away in an oasis-like setting between the hotel building and mountain slope behind, beautifully lit up at night. Guests can also enjoy a recreation center with table tennis, e-games, gym, private karaoke rooms, putting green, archery range, badminton court, sand playground, children\u2019s library, and menu of special activities that includes indigenous song-and-dance performances and indigenous outdoor cooking. As you can see, ennui is not an option here. Guestroom styling is contemporary Western and Japanese.\nHotel Royal Chihpen\nHotel Royal Chihpen (\u77e5\u672c\u8001\u723a\u9152\u5e97)\nAdd: No. 23, Ln. 113, Wenquan Village, Beinan Township, Taitung County\n(\u53f0\u6771\u7e23\u5351\u5357\u9109\u6eab\u6cc9\u6751\u9f8d\u6cc9\u8def113\u5df723\u865f)\nHot-spring type: Colorless and odorless carbonic acid alkaline spring water\nWater temperature (at source): Up to 100 degrees Celsius\nPublic transport: Take a train to Zhiben Railway Station and transfer to bus No. 8129, or take a taxi from the station.\nMore information: tour.taitung.gov.tw (Taitung Travel)\nPlace to Visit\nZhiben National Forest Recreation Area\nThe scores of inns and hotels are strung out along riverside County Road 194.

Cross a bright-red 80-meter-long bridge, buy your ticket, and head uphill to the visitor center, which has displays on the local geology and flora/fauna. From there, explore the web of mountain-slope trails between the riverside cliffs and a boundary ridge. If you have the better part of the day you can consider tackling them all, but be sure to conquer the staircase Brave Man\u2019s Slope Trail \u2013 steep, 320 meters long, rising 150 meters, 792 steps \u2013 which leads you past magnificent white-bark banyan trees. The roots of the giant Thousand Root Banyan create a fairyland setting you\u2019ll expect to see forest spirits flitting through. There are fine views toward the ocean from the highest trail-points.\nThousand Root Banyan Tree\nGuguan (Taichung City)\nIn a mountainous area of greater Taichung City, Guguan is a small settlement surrounded by high peaks, and an ideal place for escaping the big city. Guguan is quite popular with hot-spring bathing aficionados, however, and can become busy during the peak season in the winter and on weekends/holidays. The hot-spring water has a murky white color, feels smooth to the touch, and, because it contains sulfide, has a slightly pungent smell. There are a number of fine trails in the area around the village, which are great for short hikes and taking in the marvelous mountain scenery.\nBali Nature Spa Resort (\u60e0\u4f86\u8c37\u95dc\u6eab\u6cc9\u6703\u9928)\nAdd: No. 10, Wenquan Lane, Sec. 1, Dongguan Rd., Heping Dist., Taichung City\n(\u53f0\u4e2d\u5e02\u548c\u5e73\u5340\u6771\u95dc\u8def\u4e00\u6bb5\u6eab\u6cc9\u5df710\u865f)\nHot-springs type: Slightly alkaline carbonic acid spring water\nWater temperature (at source): About 60 degrees Celsius\nPublic transport: There are a number of bus services to Guguan from the central Taichung area, including Fengyuan Bus No. 153 from THSR Taichung Station, No. 207 from Fengyuan District, No. 266 from Dongshi District, and No. 850 from Taichung Railway Station\nMore information: travel.taichung.gov.tw (Taichung Travel Net)\nFurther reading on other sites:\nTai\u2019an (Miaoli County)\nThe Tai\u2019an hot-spring area is located along the Wenshui River in Miaoli County\u2019s Tai\u2019an Township.

Displays cover the tribe\u2019s history, its traditional customs, totems, weaving, attire, weapons, implements and utensils, and much else.

Small hot-spring hotels are found close to Wulai Old Street.

On any \u201cmust-do\u201d Wulai list is a ride on the Log Cart mini-train from the Wulai Old Street area to the Wulai Waterfall area.

The small Ruisui hot-spring area is located west of the town. There are just a few hot-spring establishments in what is a quiet indigenous community. Ruisui is well known as the starting point for whitewater-rafting trips down the Xiuguluan River, and the area is also home to a number of tourist-friendly dairy farms. A must-try Ruisui specialty is hotpot made with fresh locally produced milk.\nMilk hot pot\nHot-spring bathing at Ruisui\u2019s Sunshine Hot Spring B & B\nSunshine Hot Spring B&B\nFamily-run Sunshine Hot Spring B&B is on the main road leading through the Ruisui hot-springs area, 10 minutes by taxi from Ruisui Railway Station.

A farm was here before the Sunshine operation, and the attractive original Hakka-style farmhouse has been converted into the open, breezy reception and breakfast areas. The friendly operators make great coffee, using local beans. Rooms range from Japanese-style tatami dorm rooms to a suite done in European chalet-style with aromatic cypress wood, red-earth ceramic floor tiling, and in-suite spa tub.

Framed by towering mountains, Baolai sits on the banks of the Laonong River (like the aforementioned Xiuguluan, a river suitable for whitewater rafting), and is known for its beautiful surroundings. Among the things to do at Baolai is going for a walk on the Pulaixitou Tribe Historic Battle Trail, which is especially appealing during the plum-blossom season in late winter.\nHot-spring pleasures at Pu-Lao Hot Spring Hotel\nNew hot-spring park in Baolai\nPu-Lao Hot Spring Hotel,\nThe Pu-Lao Hot Spring Hotel is in a majestic setting, looking across at a low line of mountains over the sometimes roaring, generally water-thirsty Laonong River.

Here\u2019s the where and how of some top Taipei spas.\nby Chris Stowers\nupdated by Liz Tsai with additional reporting and photography by Vijay Verghese\nWHENEVER I FIND MYSELF forgetting why it is I ever chose to live in Taipei \u2013 and during the cold, damp winter months this can be relatively frequently \u2013 I console myself with the knowledge that relief from the blues is not far away.\nFew cities can boast such a natural abundance of world-class, volcanically activated hot water springs on their doorstep as the Taiwanese capital. And thanks to Taipei\u2019s ever-improving public transport system, heading out for a quick soak in perfect 60-degree-Celsius waters \u2013 cool beers at hand and a massage in mind \u2013 has never been easier.\nStylish Yangmingshan Tien Lai resort/ photo: hotel\nThe Japanese pined for their hot springs (or onsen) whilst governing Taiwan for the first half of the 20th century and soon set their sights on the hills around Taipei.\nThe area around Beitou, supplied naturally by the geothermal energy of neighbouring Yang Ming Shan (the still active volcano, itself a National Park) became an obvious location for the beer halls, tea gardens, bathhouses and intimate hotels so beloved of the era. For Taipei spas, hot springs, and Taipei spa resorts, the Beitou spa region is the ideal hunting ground.\nXin Beitou (or New Peitou), connected by its own separate line to Taipei\u2019s wonderful Mass Rapid Transit system, or MRT, is the most popular and easily accessible of several hot spring regions \u2013 others include Wu Lai and Jin Shan \u2013 which surround Taipei.\nIts spas help keep the Japanese tradition alive, despite a decline in the popularity of spa-going through the 1970s and \u201980s.\nToday, new resorts are springing up offering spa packages catering to tired businessmen, health-conscious families and reticent lovers, alike. Be it hot oil massages, aromatherapy treatments, saunas, karaoke (optional) or fine dining, the Hot Spring Renaissance is upon us.\nXin Beitou area springs and inns\nXin Beitou is the first choice getaway from Taipei. For just about US$1 the aforementioned MRT will whisk you from Taipei\u2019s Main Station out to Beitou, a half-hour ride away. Change at this station for a single stop along the branch line to the Xin Beitou terminus and it\u2019s as though you\u2019ve entered a different world. A taxi from Taipei will do the run in about 30 to 40 minutes depending on the traffic for roughly around NT$300 one-way.\nAloft Beitou room/ photo: hotel\nNot quite in Xin Beitou but a short walk from the Qiyan train stop just before Xin Beitou when coming from Taipei City,  a hip newby in this general area is the Aloft Taipei Beitou (opened January 2017, www.marriott.com/aloft-taipei-beitou/ ) with its 292 'jet-setter-styled' rooms ranging from 30sq m to a 48sq m Sweet Suite or an exceptionally roomy 89sq m Breezy Suite, all with large flat screen televisions, fast and free WiFi, and Camp Aloft for kids. Get a 20 percent discount on early bird bookings a week in advance. The hotel has a car park too. This is a hotel-style high-rise with lively interiors.\nThe decor is minimalist and modern with purple themes and blue mesh screens punctuated by splashes of colour. Expect a gym for evening workouts, a restaurant, the W XYZ bar, and small corporate meetings facilities for up to 80 persons. Need an upbeat company team-building jaunt? This may be the answer.\nUniquely, this hotel is a pet friendly address where your dog is welcome to join you for dinner at Nook, perhaps the first international city restaurant here to welcome canine companions. What's more, for a small outlay of NT$100 your dog will get a special doggie treats, toys and a complimentary diaper. A doggie meal is NT$280. Do ensure Fido is under 15kg to qualify for this barkingly good welcome. Aloft Beitou is not smack in the hot springs area but is happy to arrange transportation to Xin Beitou and its many steaming distractions.\nIn Xin Beitou, mountain greenery and wafting sulphur vapours stimulate the senses. Straight across from the train station is the Hot Spring Museum, a painstakingly restored Japanese colonial-era bathhouse containing all you ever needed to know about the history of Beitou's spas. Running uphill beside the museum is a road looping up into the steaming foothills, with most of the best Taiwan hot spring resorts located, conveniently, around its circuitous route.\nHotel Royal  Beitou/ photo: hotel\nOne of the first hot spring areas you'll encounter is the Millennium Hot Spring bathhouse adjacent to the museum. This government-run hot spring area is accessible for an incredibly affordable NT$40, and consists of several hot spring pools of varying temperatures for the public to enjoy.\nHowever, unlike many of the private resort establishments, only carefully guarded communal pools are available, meaning visitors are required to wear bathing suits while soaking under the watchful eyes of hot spring attendants.\nFor a more refined approach, however, the absolutely best place to begin a tour of Taipei spas in the Beitou area is at the Yitsun Hotel. Built in 1901, the hotel was originally named Xin Nai Tang, and was later renamed Yitsun in honor of Dr Sun Yat-sen's given name of Sun Yi-xian. According to the hotel, he had once visited and praised the quality of its hot springs.\nYitsun was also a favoured spot for Japanese army officers \u2013 during the second world war, kamikaze pilots would often spend their last nights in Beitou. It is a beautifully preserved wood-panelled collection of rooms built on different levels, set within a garden ring of bonsai trees and centred round an ornate goldfish pond.\nMany of the guestrooms are decorated as they've always been in the Japanese style, with tatami mats being the order of the day. Genial matron, Mrs Lee, is one of a gaggle of elderly female staff to whom the Yitsun has been both workplace and home since her teenage years. One of the eccentric design touches at the Yitsun is its lobby furniture, reminiscent of Beirut Airport, circa 1973.\nWhispering Pines/ photo: hotel\nThe baths \u2013 the heart of any hot spring resort \u2013 are of the communal type, one for men and one for women. These steaming hot sunken pools are set in grey slate stone with views through large windows to the garden foliage beyond. The waters here are clouded almost white, topping-out at around 60 degrees Celsius, comfortable enough to make for long, lazy dips.\nGuests wander around as though at home, stopping off for a few minutes in the pool or ordering some of the Yitsun kitchen's fabulous Taiwanese or Japanese food. This is eaten cross-legged at low tables. Sliding doors open to admit gentle breezes and the sound of water trickling in the nearby rock garden.\nDutch design outfit Mecanoo has managed to harness grained stone and textured wood to create a sense of  local culture, history, and environment at the Hotel Royal Beitou ( www.hotelroyal.com.tw/beitou/ ), a wellness and therapy retreat. Six spacious Family rooms offer scented plants, hot spring baths and soothing music to get you in the mood. Healthy in-room snacks are free. Standard rooms offer woody accents on the walls and stone floors, with flat-screen TVs and hot spring baths. Yoga mats are on hand too in all rooms. Quan Spa uses specially-sourced essential oils and 'energy massage stones'. And on the top floor is the Mu Hot Springs with hydrotherapy facilities and green hill views.\nA little further up the valley is Whispering Pines Inn. Of similar vintage and design to the Yitsun, the password here is discretion. No neon signs or garish fairy lights advertise this spa. One could almost mistake it for a private home. It is this low-key quality that patrons appreciate. Stars such as Richard Gere and Zhang Zhiyi (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) number among the many VIPs to have sought escape here.\nSweetme new look/ photo: Verghese\nBlind masseuses are on hand to work out those knotty muscles, if relaxing in the milky sulphur waters hasn't already done the trick. Later, delicious Taiwanese delicacies tempt the palate, with ice-cold Taiwan Beer to chase them down.\nA stone\u2019s throw away, a hot spring experience of a more energetic nature is offered by the huge, glitzy and revamped Spring City Resort ( www.springresort.com.tw/ ). This is the sort of place to visit armed with an agenda \u2014 there\u2019s stuff to keep you occupied every minute of the day. Outside, the extensive grounds include cafes and warm sulphur paddling ponds, children\u2019s play areas, swimming pools and fountains.\nThere\u2019s a health club with all the trappings. All rooms come with en suite hot spring baths. Top of the range is the Spring Suite, decorated in minimalist Japanese style. This includes its very own juniper pool and precisely geometrical Japanese yard, a huge dining room laid with tatami mats, state of the art entertainment systems and so on. When not relaxing or exercising, there\u2019s no end to the opportunities for eating. Chinese, Japanese and Western menus are on offer at the main restaurants of this five-storey pleasure dome.\nThe intriguingly named 69-room Sweetme Hotspring Resort ( www.sweetme.com.tw ) is a contemporary streamlined option with the no nonsense design touches of traditional Japan just a short stroll from the MRT station. This narrow, medium-rise hotel at the base of a small valley, has an unprepossessing exterior but the interiors are surprisingly serene and welcoming. Find blond-wood parquet, cream and beige tones, glass partitions, tatami flooring and ikebana displays. Each room harbours its own private dip pool \u2013 a sculptural work of art in its own right \u2013 filled directly from the hot springs.\nThe Deluxe Double rooms reappeared in October 2011 with a smart new look, featuring flat-screen TV, new air-conditioners, tatami futons, camera-size safes, mini-bar, and small desk with one three-pin multi-plug socket. Some sport a narrow balcony with open views across the town and valley.\nKagaya highrise/ photo: hotel\nThe hotel has some limited spa facilities. A word of caution at Beitou hotels: the drainage system is antiquated and many establishments encourage used toilet paper to be deposited in a separate sanitary bag \u2013 not in the flush.\nThe public spa and hot springs area nearby has a Japanese-Mediterranean touch and promises to treat you \u201clike a Roman aristocrat\u201d. A Chinese restaurant and coffee shop are on hand to provide post-soak nourishment and a swift return to Asia.\nHailing from a storied Japanese family of inns, the Radium Kagaya ( www.kagaya.com.tw/en ) arrived in Beitou in December 2010 with the usual unremarkable if neat angular high-rise exterior married with an exquisite \"landscaped\" Japanese interior with water features, bamboo fronds, pebbled pathways, rice-paper screens, woody surrounds, art works, and black granite spring-fed tubs in many rooms. A blond-wood Garden View Mixed Deluxe Suite offers a Western-style twin bed arrangement with city views out from the tatami-style living area and a black-stone bathtub.\nTry an Executive Suite with Open-Air Hot Spring Bath or a Western Guestroom if the spirit is less adventurous. A useful blend of mixed design rooms will ensure guests remain at ease. And the Special Suite on the 16th floor is a lavish affair with twin beds that will not offend Western sensibilities. Female attendants - or butlers - are on hand to dole out that special brand of Japanese hospitality and, conveniently, being situated lower down the hillside, the train station is close by.\nChic Villa 32 lobby/ photo: Vijay Verghese\nClose by  but dramatically up the scale of exclusivity on the narrow road winding up the low hills, is a Xin Beitou hideaway gem, Villa 32 ( www.villa32.com/ ). Hiding behind high walls lies a world of gurgling water features, a splendid minimalist Zen landscape littered with lanterns (discreetly submerged, of course), and a cache of vintage vino in the speciality wine cellar.\nThe award-winning Villa 32 sets the standard now for all of Xin Beitou's aspiring hot spring hotels. The lobby is contemporary and elegant, manned by beaming staff who appear well trained and alert. Understanding English is not a problem here.\nEnjoy alfresco Italian gourmet dining beneath towering camphor and maple trees, and for once (in this child tolerant city) escape the charms of childish chatter thanks to Villa 32\u2019s policy of restricting children under the age of 16. Hurrah! There are just five suites, three in a quiet, contemporary European style, and two in Japanese d\u00e9cor. The Japanese suites are on a single level while the European suites are split-level with the soaking tub upstairs.\nWater for the tub comes in directly from the spring. Expect muted pastel tones with a woody flavour, flatscreen TV in the living room as well as a large LCD in the bedroom, heavy window drapes in earth tones and a black stone toilet.\nThere are two outdoor hot spring areas, one for men and one for women. Each offers three spa treatment rooms and eight hot pools all served up in a neat Japanese modular design with cream stone flooring and water features. To walk in here you\u2019ll have to get naked. Entirely. Stylish, discreet, and modern, Villa 32 is associated with Relais & Chateaux and is easily among the best Taiwan spa resorts and certainly one to seriously explore for a Taipei hot spring excursion.\nElegant Grand View Resort/ photo: Vijay Verghese\nHeading up the same ribbon of uncertain road, a three-minute drive will bring you to the  ultra-modern Grand View Resort ( www2.gvrb.com.tw/ , which arrived back in 2011 causing quite a flutter. This charming grey-stone retreat is exquisitely Japanese in design and execution with neat clean lines, and a central black-tile pool overlooking the valley. Just a tad higher up, it offers cleaner air and better views. All the rooms pipe in hot spring water to scald you silly.\nA Standard room serves up a wooden floor, flatscreen TV, DVD, sound system, coffee and tea facilities, a big flat safe for your notebook, a balcony (with a lounging divan) presenting hill or valley views, and two grey-stone tubs to sensibly separate hot and cold soaks. It\u2019s the best way to sober up.\nThe top-of-the-line You Ya Suite (taking its name from the road) is worth exploring if you really wish to splash out in style. On offer, apart from the invitingly plump white bed, is a generous outdoor patio to catch the sun and soak some more in a large square tub. There are nice views in all directions. Ask for Room 603. This Beitou resort also has a nice spa. All in, an elegant address. As its brochure says, \"Several decades of hot spring pool, compose adult well-being of thick art paper space.\" Our sentiments exactly. With great attention to detail and design, this is without doubt, one of the best Taipei spa hotels and Beitou resorts in our hot springs review. Try the \"Immune system promotion treatment\" or a \"Deep awaken treatment\" for the whole body.\nOn the aptly named Wenquan Road, which translates to \u201cHot Spring Road\u201d, is the Kyoto Spring Hotel ( www.kyoto-spring.com.tw/ ). Although its hot springs have been in existence since the Japanese colonial era, the hotel didn't officially open to the public until 2004. This quiet hideaway has Japanese and Western fusion-styled rooms that are secluded by a beautiful wooded area. However, the hotel also offers a link to the outside world by providing free Internet access for those who opt to bring along their laptop computers.\nGaia's amazing four-storey library / photo: hotel\nFarther up the road and across from Kyoto Spring is the Nine Plus Spa Hot Spring Hotel. Aside from its hot springs, Nine Plus also boasts an Imperial Room lounge where customers can surround themselves with Chinese antiques and paintings while enjoying some hot tea.\nThe art gallery around the corner also showcases some pieces from the owner's private collection of Buddhist-themed stones and carvings. Meanwhile, the restaurant allows patrons to enjoy a variety of Japanese and Chinese delicacies between soaks in the hot spring in the form of afternoon tea or set meals.\nIn a world unto its own, the Asia Pacific Resort ( www.apresort.com.tw/ ) covers a massive 72,000 square feet surrounded by bamboo trees and an assortment of seasonal flora for the ultimate tranquil Taiwan hot spring retreat.\nThis family-friendly resort has a separate swimming pool area for the children to have something to do while the adults can choose from five different kinds of indoor or outdoor hot spring baths. A spa facility also allows guests to have the knots worked out of their shoulders under the fingertips of experienced masseuses.\nAlthough the Asia Pacific is situated farther up in the hills than most other resorts, patrons needn't worry about hiking all the way up there on foot, as there are regularly scheduled free shuttle bus services to and from the Xin Beitou MRT station.\nA similar high-end facility located on a winding path just off of Wenquan Road is the Pacific Wellness Spa & Club that went strangely silent in 2019. Here guests were treated to individual hot spring suites complete with large granite bathtubs and separate shower rooms.\nVolando Urai Lake Suite  photo: hotel\nThe Gaia Hotel ( www.thegaiahotel.com/ ) is a slightly different offering with nice design accents, pale wood flooring, pastel tone rooms, and a dedication to nature. Park at the top floor Gaia Suite for wraparound views of Beitou along with the comfort of flatscreen TVs, large beds, and a separate hot sulphur spring soaking room. Expect Hermes toiletries, Fuji water, and Nespresso coffee shots. The Gaia features an unusual library with cube cream sofas at the centre of a light-filled room, surrounded by bookshelves rising up a four-storey atrium. There is a good 20m swimming pool that catches natural light, a gym, and a spa too. Nicely set up hot spring rooms for a sulphur water soak (for a couple) will set you back around NT$2,500 for 90 minutes, Mondays to Fridays. The public hot springs at the hotel are free for guests and cost NT$1,800 for outside visitors from 7am to 11pm.\nWulai resorts and hot springs\nNational Route 9 snakes along the contours of a steep valley towards the small settlement of Wulai, 20km southeast of central Taipei. Clustered here are some of the most splendid hot springs of Taiwan. Principal among them is the Volando Urai Spring Spa & Resort (formerly SpringPark Spa and Resort). Designed \u2013 unlike much of Taiwan\u2019s architecture \u2013 to blend into the landscape, and using much wood and local stone to achieve this effect, Spring Park offers world class facilities to an otherwise very local destination. All this in a wonderful location overlooking the waters.\nSoaking in a deep tub, staring out through floor-to-ceiling windows, one takes in the copper-green waters of the river, overshadowed by a towering wooded hillside. One thing you\u2019ll notice is the crystal clarity of Wulai's sulphur water, and its lack of odour (a distinct plus for those who turn their noses up at the boiled-egg smell of most sulphur springs).\nThe Scandinavian atmosphere of Spring Park resort is enhanced by its open plan, multi-tiered layout. Light and \u201clightness\u201d is worshipped, in all its senses. A caf\u00e9 and various restaurants make use of open-air terraces. Whether it's nouvelle cuisine or a good old-fashioned massage, rest assured that the traffic and bustle of Taiwan is another world away from this, Taipei\u2019s most international hot spring resort and one of the best Taipei spa hotels.\nVolando Urai Dasha Spa/ photo: hotel\nTurn left immediately after crossing the narrow bridge at the start of Wulai village and follow the country lane for half a kilometre as it clings to the mountainside, a white river crashing by on your left side, a long way down, and you'll find the Wulai Spring Resort. The resort\u2019s open-air pools look out onto the privacy of thickly jungled mountainside, across the river. Catering to the domestic and Japanese tourist markets, the Japanese rooms here offer that bedroll-on-wooden-floor experience so essential to the delivery of a solid night\u2019s sleep in the Taiwanese countryside. The private hot spring rooms are just right, no unnecessary gadgets; a true back-to-nature experience and at a price that fits.\nMore representative of the older, family-run hot springs \u2013 which have attracted visitors to the curative properties of Wulai's sulphur waters for decades \u2013 is the Guo Chi Yen Hot Spring. An unabashedly communal experience, the sounds of kids splashing and shrieking in delight welcomes one to this resort. Families and groups of friends often prefer the more casual atmosphere of these traditional baths to the contemplative privacy of places like Spring Park Resort.\nAfter a soak, punctuated by many cool showers, happy day-trippers mingle, drinking beer, eating salty local snacks and playing cards \u2014 it's the Taipei equivalent of a day trip to the beach. Similar in terms of price and range of facilities on offer, the Tungfung Hot Spring Lodge, located a short distance down Wulai's main street from Guo Chi Yen, is well worth popping into.\nThey are so relaxed here that no limit is imposed on the length of your stay. Pay your entrance fee and soak all day (and well into the night, too)!\nYangmingshan Tien Lai Japanese room/ photo: hotel\nFor more modern fare, the Full Moon Spa ( www.fullmoonspa.net ) retains an old world charm with its Japanese-styled decor, while still appealing to visitors who prefer more contemporary facilities. Polished wood is the dominant theme, which gives the interiors a warm, pleasant glow that contrasts nicely with the wide-window views of deep green forests outside.\nJinshan (Yangmingshan)\nThe Jinshan hot spring region is located on the northern side of Yangmingshan, the volcanic National Park. It is a beautiful area, high up in the clouds and a good hour\u2019s drive north from central Taipei (about US$25 by cab, each way). On a clear day one can see down to the ocean at the northernmost tip of Taiwan's rugged coastline.\nHikers naturally gravitate to the trails across this rugged area. End a hard day\u2019s walk at the Yangmingshan Tien Lai Resort & Spa ( www.tienlai.com.tw/en/ ), Jinshan's most elaborate hot spring resort. Whether it\u2019s a restorative hour-long sulphur dip or a weekend hideaway, the Tien Lai comes up trumps. One of the most impressive features here is its open-air pools that drop-off dramatically against a background of sweeping mountain scenery. There are sulphur showers and fountains, even a special area designated for hard-boiling your eggs!\nInside, many rooms come with their own hot spring baths. The main body of the complex houses a well-equipped health club, including both dry and humid-style saunas. Pick from European style rooms or Japanese. This is by far one of the best quality spa resorts in Northern Taiwan and within striking distance of Taipei. If you wish, you can bring along 300 people for a small corporate meeting or conference in the clean hill air. The hotel has meeting facilities with flexible space for events.\nAsia Pacific courtyard/ photo: hotel\nScrubbed and pummelled clean, one can then proceed to the resort\u2019s many and varied restaurants and caf\u00e9s to fortify oneself for the journey home.\nIn JinshanTownship, a little further down the mountainside, a cheap and friendly hot spring experience is offered at the eponymous Jinshan Hot Springs.\nRelax for as long as you can stand their piping hot acidic sulphur waters. Private baths as well as public pools are available, along with the ubiquitous, life-saving ice-cold Taiwan Beer.\nThe Ba Ian Hot Spring Resort ( www.ba-ian.com.tw/ ) is a fancier option where in between dips in hot sulphur springs, guests can enjoy coffee and dessert on an open balcony overlooking sweeping views of endless mountaintops. The high altitude ensures patrons are surrounded by only crisp, clean mountain air free of the city's noise and car exhaust.\nTaipei spa hotels and options in the city\nIf time is of the essence, there\u2019s no need to leave Taipei City for a spa experience. Simply jump in a cab to Shangri-La's Far Eastern Plaza Hotel ( www.shangri-la.com/taipei/ ). This is a place for sweeping views with a a dose of wellness and massage too. Explore the Japanese-style Qi Shiseido Salon and Spa (opened April 2013) on the 40th floor. Nothing will be lost in translation here. Sit down with a therapist and explore \"qi estherapy\" focusing on balancing your energy flow. Nothing better than a solid dose of qi before the next CEO chinwag or smacking the kids around. There's a nail treament set-up too so book your manicure.\nShideido Spa at Shangri-La/ photo: hotel\nA relative newcomer to the Taipei spa scene is Miramar Spa ( www.miramargarden.com.tw ), on the spacious 2nd floor of the Miramar Garden Hotel. Located in the hotel\u2019s Vigor Health Club, with its floor-to-ceiling windows, the spa specialises in facial treatments and in detoxifying the executive body in (almost) every way imaginable.\nFancy some lymphatic drainage? A collagen treatment? Being sculpted by Dead Sea Salts? Then Miramar is the spa for you.\nIn town, and centrally located, there's always the trusty Wellspring Spa at Regent Taipei ( www.regenthotels.com/regent-taipei/ ) that runs from 10am till midnight with specially tailored treatments. Or pop by the newer and quite spectacular luxury wellness area at Mandarin Oriental Taipei ( www.mandarinoriental.com/taipei/ ) where menus range from modern to ancient and private spa suites await - for singles or couples..\nAnd that\u2019s the skinny on Taiwan spas. Don\u2019t worry. If all this has transformed you into a spa-junkie, Taipei is certainly the right city to get your next fix.\nGrand View Resort spa/ photo: hotel\nAloft Taipei Beitou.

Bottoms up!\nPhoto by: Jigger and Pony\nBy Nicole-Marie Ng and Time Out Singapore editors |\nJune 2019: We have five new bars on our DRINK List placed up front for your easy reference from Madame Fan Bar to Cool Cats . The most notable inclusion is The Old Man , the Singapore offshoot of the current number one on the Asia's 50 Best Bars list.\nWelcome to the Time Out DRINK List, our handpicked \u2018best of\u2019 Singapore\u2019s drinking scene. These are the most buzzing bars in this city right now: the most inventive and most memorable watering holes, all ranked by expert local editors. Drinking in Singapore is expensive so we did all the hard work for you \u2013 scouring the city every night in search of amazing drinks.\nWhether you sip or quaff, these are the city's top bars for a boozy night out. We've got joints stocked with quality vino , speakeasies hidden behind unmarked doors, dens devoted to whisky , craft\u00a0beer breweries and much more in our roundup. We guarantee you won't be able to stop at one drink \u2013 just make sure you have a safe ride home.\nDrank somewhere on this list and loved it? Share it with the hashtag #TimeOutDrinkList. You can also find out more about how Time Out makes recommendations and reviews bars here .\n1\nCity Hall\nMadame Fan Bar is an intimate 40-seater cocktail haven helmed by award-winning bartender Davide Boncimino. The bar might be an offshoot of the Cantonese restaurant located next to it, but don't expect cheesy Chinese-inspired cocktails that are more thematic than tempting. Davide takes a culinary approach to his drinks, making use of high-quality ingredients such as the best strawberries and cherry tomatoes to make a sherbert from scratch. This sherbet goes into making a drink called Portofino ($24), a gin-based cocktail inspired by his Italian heritage. He also crafts his own liqueurs, which can be found in the boozy Yu Cha ($26), a take on a gin martini with shiso vermouth, peated green tea and herbal liqueur that's served in a little teapot for some extra flair.\nChinatown\nVintage vinyl records of Japanese jazz singers, American funk and legendary soul artists line the walls of RPM by D.Bespoke. At the far end of the bar, you'll find a turntable and Iwamitsu Shinji, head bar manager, mixologist and maestro. The Kyushu-born bartender is from Miyazaki Prefecture \u2013 a large shochu-producing region in Japan \u2013 and makes cocktails with shochu as its base. Unlike sake, which made by fermenting rice, shochu is distilled from rice, barley, sweet potatoes and other starchy ingredients. Sample different types by ordering a tasting flight ($35), or try classics like the lemon sour ($23) and dark and stormy ($23).\nChinatown\nKeep an eye out for the pineapple lamp along the revamped stretch of K\u0113sa House on Keong Saik. Once you spot it, push open the heavy white doors to find a long, bronze, H-shaped bar and a mosaic portrait of Ernest Hemingway. The bar is named after the literary classic, The Old Man and the Sea, and first launched in Hong Kong in 2017. Barely a year later, it took the fifth spot on the Asia\u2019s 50 Best Bars list and 10th on World\u2019s 50 Best Bars. Try some of its signature cocktails like The Snows of Kilimanjaro, Green Hills of Africa and Islands in the Stream \u2013 all priced at an affordable $17.\nLet Idlewild sweep you off your feet and whisk you away on a magical adventure around the world. Named after John F. Kennedy International Airport\u2019s original moniker, the stunning bar is inspired by the golden age of 1940s travel. Helmed by award-winning bartender Andy Griffiths \u2013 who was most recently the head of mixology for The Speakeasy Group in Australia \u2013 Idlewild transports guests to far-flung parts of the globe. Try Mexico City\u2019s Sugarloaf ($24) made with fermented pineapple tepache, tamarind, rum, cognac and drizzled with gula Melaka.\nJazz things up at Cool Cats, the NCO Club's live entertainment lounge, which sees a rotation of artists gracing its stage from 9.30pm. Its cocktail menu is inspired by moments in music. There are 14 tipples available that cover everything from 1800s ragtime to legendary jazz artists Billie Holiday and Duke Ellington. Try The Ways of the Diva ($24), a tribute to the one and only Empress of the Blues Bessie Smith, a deceptively simple blend of\u00a0Mozart Dry Chocolate, mezcal, pear. For something a little boozier, go for the Professor of Swing ($26), a mix of VSOP, vermouth, liqueur and bitters.\nTanjong Pagar\nEvery six months, Junior switches things up with a different cocktail concept. Its first was Noma, a showcase of mezcal and tequila and the second, Magnolia, highlighted New Orleans as the birthplace of cocktails like the Grasshopper. Its latest reincarnation pays homage to the Tiki bars of Polynesia. Name Pacifica, the concept offers four sections of drinks:\u00a0Legends of Liquid Lore, Apertiki, Traditional Tipples of the Tropics and Progressive Potions of Pacifica. Try one from each \u2013 we recommend the Zombie ($25) and the\u00a0Hua\u2019ai Tai ($25), a take n the classic Mai Tai but with homemade miso and corn orgeat \u2013 but be warned that despite their easy-drinking nature, these cocktails are potently boozy.\nWarning: this basement bar hidden along a back alley at the junction of Club Street and Ann Siang Hill is terribly hard to find but the effort is well worth it. Head to the small path behind Oxwell & Co and look out for the illegible scrawlings on the wall and above the door. Descend into the lair lit by a cloud of bulbs above the bar.\u00a0Operation Dagger is a hotbed of creativity and cocktail craftsmanship, try ts range of house-fermented wines or pick a cocktail from its ever-changing menu that still has the sense to keep firm faves like the Hot + Cold ($25).\nTanjong Pagar\nPay a visit to the current fourth seat on the Asia's 50 Best Bars list, a second-floor sanctum on bustling\u00a0Amoy Street that's dedicated to all things regional. Let the knowledgeable bar team led by Vijay Mudaliar educate you on spirits from Thailand, the Phillippines, India and beyond, paired with foraged ingredients to give you a taste of Southeast Asia in a cocktail. If you ask nicely, they'll lead you upstairs to see where they distil house gins in flavours like matcha and coffee.\nOrchard\nOn the second level of Regent Singapore sits a portal to 19th-century New York City, where ladies are decorated in pearls and gentlemen dressed to the nines. Under lowered lights, large leather armchairs and sofas gather around tables to offer enough privacy for a clandestine rendezvous. Its craft cocktails that trace New York's history through the years starting from the 1520s when the early settlers first arrived. If nothing calls out from its creative selection, stick to the classics like a good ol' New York Sour ($25).\nTanjong Pagar\nThis homey bar is your best bet if you\u2019re looking for a crash course on wine. Praelum stocks about 350 labels in its walk-in cellar that you can order in tasting pours and half-portions. Or leave it to the knowledgeable\u00a0somm, Gerald Lu, to recommend reds, whites, ros\u00e9s, dessert and sparkling wines \u2013 an even mix of both classic and modern producers, refreshed every week \u2013 to suit your fancy.\nTanjong Pagar\nOne of the OGs of Singapore's craft cocktail bar scene, Jigger and Pony has found new life in its new space at the Amara Hotel. Its focus is still on doing the classics right, especially its signature Old Fashioned ($23). Asian favourites aren't forgotten either. There's the Jungle Bird ($23), Kuala Lumpur\u2019s calling card of Phraya rum, lemongrass, clarified granny smith apple juice, Campari and lime and other well-loved tipples.\nGibson feels like the old friend you visit when a night out calls for good conversation. It\u2019s a disarming charm that worms its way into the snacks and cocktails. The namesake Gibson ($23) is a boozy creation served with three bite-sized portions of nukazuke, pickled pearl onion, smoked quail egg. Its recently updated menu incorporates Asian ingredients and the flavours of the region alongside a series of non-alcoholic beverages for those attempting dry July.\nThis grand art deco-inspired bar \u2013 complete with magnificent champagne-hued tapestries, intricate gold and bronze balconies and, of course, a massive gin tower standing imposingly over the space \u2013 is a definite must-visit. It houses the world's largest collection of gins, with over 1,000 bottles on its shelves, and an impressive champagne cellar to boot. The cocktails are just an impressive, get the Atlas Martini ($24), a spine-tingling blend of gin, Ambrato vermouth, orange bitters, champagne vinegar and pomelo or one of its other expertly crafted concoctions.\nChinatown\nLong before craft joints were sprouting up all over the city, there was Smith Street Taps, one of the OGs of Singapore's beer scene housed in a hawker centre, no less. The stall offers 12 rotating international and local craft beers on tap, priced from an unbeatable $8 a pint. It's also a couple of steps away from The Good Beer Company that offers craft beers and sake by the bottle for the discerning kopitiam\u00a0goer.\nOrchard\nThe entrance to this sexy saloon is hidden behind an unmarked door that blends into the surroundings of Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel. Press the buzzer and a hostess should lead you a den that offers\u00a0thoughtful cocktail creations prepared by Dario Knox. There are no labels on the bottles here. That\u2019s because each liquor \u2013 rum, whisky, moonshine, what-have-you \u2013 and its many expressions have been aged and finished in casks by Knox himself.\nThis is hands down, every oenophiles' most beloved shrine to natural wines. And you know it\u2019s legit because it\u2019s always buzzing with industry folks. There\u2019s no catalogue at this gastrobar \u2013 its 150-or-so labels (from $58) are all on display and constantly changing. If it\u2019s an education you\u2019re after, swing by every day (well, Tuesdays to Saturdays), because the wines-by-the-glass (one white and one red, from $12) change daily. Plus, the grub is excellent too.\nChinatown\nThis legendary import from New York City is always crazy packed \u2013 even if the empty psychic booth lit by a neon sign doesn't give any indication of the madness that lies within. Jostle\u00a0through the crowd of diehard regulars and industry types who jockey for the attentions of the chef-coat\u2013clad barkeeps. There's more peace at the back of the room where you can enjoy plates from its mordern\u00a0American menu and a boozy beverage of choice.\nRaffles Place\nRemember the cool kid at school who was indifferent to instruction but kept scoring top marks? That\u2019s 28 HongKong Street. Calling the ground floor of an old shophouse home, it's one of the first speakeasies in Singapore \u2013 and is still going strong despite its lack of marketing and social media presence. Instead, it relies on a seamless blend of urban swag and American-styled libations: expect only hip-hop classics to cascade from those speakers and cocktails named after rappers like Fernet About Dre ($23), The Real Slim Shandy ($23) and Yeesuze ($23).\nIn skyscraper-dense Singapore, rooftop bars are no rarity. But when one's perched on the Old Supreme Court Building, where the National Gallery currently stands, you know it's pretty special. Helmed by a new head bartender, Jorge Conde who hails from Galicia, Spain, Smoke & Mirror's menu aims to regale you with unusual flavour combinations and culinary magic. Highlights include the spirit-forward\u00a0Dali\u2019s Self Portrait,\u00a0a blend of malts, bacon fat and herbal wine and the Smoke & Mirrors #4, which combines agaves, strawberry and cacao.\nTanjong Pagar\nJust like how The Other Room redefined speakeasies in Singapore, The Other Roof is out to raise the\u00a0bar of rooftop bars. Take the lift up the top of Ann Siang House and be greeted by the massive space that seats 75 (or even 150 upon request) \u2013 a far cry from The Other Room's tiny space. Lounge al fresco while sipping on tea-infused spirits and snacking on light but tasty bites.\u00a0 Blending tea time with cocktail o'clock, the bar offers drinks like Stairway to Heaven ($22), a love-it-or-hate-it concoction of pineapple, coriander, celery and vanity tea rum, or La Boheme\u00a0($22), a refreshing blend of cr\u00e9me de cassis, bubbly and black currant soul tea gin.\nSkinny's is as divey as it gets. Its pool table out front, graffiti-laced walls, private karaoke room and stiff AF drinks are all a part of its charm. The effortlessly cool bar is where all the industry folks hang out after hours. Its Fast and Cheap menu has drinks like the Americano and Paloma priced at $15 while the Make it Nice option\u00a0allows more discerning drinkers to upgrade other classics ($18) with artisanal spirits at just a $3 top-up.\nCome for the Happy Hour negroni, stay for the view and the hearty Italian food \u2013 we're looking at you, veal meatballs. Jigger and Pony, one of Singapore's main bar groups,\u00a0teams up with chef David Tang, formerly of Cut by Wolfgang Puck in New York, to present modern Italian fare and drinks that hit the spot.\u00a0Happy hour from 3pm to 7.30pm is the best time to visit. There are fros\u00e9s at $12, spritzes for $13 and specialty cocktails going at $15 \u2013 a real steal for those looking for a sundowner poised against an unbeatable backdrop.\nCity Hall\nAnti:dote is what you get when you cross a utilitarian hotel bar with the whimsical imaginations of husband and wife team, Tryson Quek and Bannie\u00a0Kang. Kang helms the bar, offering a solid menu of nine mixed drinks of reinvented classics alongside an impressive list of spirits available in 45ml or 60ml pours. The Rabbit Hole ($23) is a refreshing one to start with \u2013 a mix of carrot juice spiked with Hendrick's Gin, Mancino Bianco and\u00a0elderflower liqueur \u2013 best paired with chicken liver parfait from Quek's progressive European-meets-Asian tapas menu.\nOutram\nThe Flagship proudly proclaims itself the 'home of the Old Fashioned'. And with 200 labels of whisky behind the bar, you know it takes its tagline to heart. But instead of overwhelming diners with an impossible range of Old Fashioned variations, there are just four to choose from. There\u2019s the Classic Old Fashioned, Wine of the South, Sherry Cask Old Fashioned and Journey of the West, all retailing at $22. But you're not feeling what's on the menu, the bartender can mix you something from the whiskies, gins or rums available on the shelf.\nTanjong Pagar\nThere are few bars as intensely personal as Shin Gi Tai. A cocktail specialist co-owned by Anthony Zhong (ex-Jigger & Pony), the operation is a one-man-show on most nights. The mood is chatty and convivial. Share your preferred spirits and flavour profiles, and Zhong can whip up something to suit. There are an impressive 180 off-the-menu options in his repertoire. (Hint: you can\u2019t go wrong with his signature Negroni, equal parts gin, sweet vermouth and Campari.) Otherwise, there\u2019s a list of updated classics to order from.\nThis gorgeously hip bar is worth a visit just for its jungle of overhanging bottles and unique perfume menu \u2013 a collaboration with International Flavors & Fragrances. Drinks like Oud and Lust ($24), flavoured with distilled clay and shiitake, and Cream of Sandlewood ($24) are inspired by the gorgeous scents of established fragrance houses.\nMarina Bay\nNo prizes for guessing on which floor this bar and restaurant is perched. Billed as the world\u2019s highest microbrewery, Level33 gloriously overlooks the Marina Bay, and, thanks to the decor and service, is perhaps the most sophisticated place to quaff a locally brewed beer. Five brews are permanently on the menu: an IPA, stout, wheat beer, house porter and blonde lager. They bear classic flavour profiles \u2013 the brewery claims to use \u2018authentic recipes and brewing methods\u2019 \u2013 so don\u2019t expect funky American-style notes here.\nFor a refined wine and whisky experience, La Terre doesn't disappoint. But we warned, it's going to cost you. Japanese sommelier Daisuke Kawai \u2013 formerly from two-Michelin-starred Les Amis \u2013 recommends only the best bottles to pair with your meal. And that's no easy task given that the\u00a0wine list has thousands of bottles\u00a0of champagnes, red and whites and whiskies. Depending on what you order, prices can hit the thousands too, with a 1999 bottle of Henri Jayer Vosne-Romanee Cros Parantoux from Burgundy, a headline-grabbing hot favourite at wine auctions, topping the price list at $23,006.\nCity Hall\nThe OG of local rooftop bars might be \u2013 literally \u2013 overshadowed by younger upstarts on taller buildings, but it hasn't yet lost its place on our list of watering holes for a fun night out. The beer is cold, the vibe casual, and the food now deserves special mention, thanks to Bjorn Shen. The chef-owner of Artichoke brings his 'dude food' leanings to Loof. We're talking over-the-top and greasy-in-a-good-way dishes that you wish you could save in the fridge for when the munchies hit all paired with cheeky locally inspired cocktails.\nCity Hall\nLocated on the quiet second floor of the Rendezvous Hotel, the bar\u2019s out-of-the-way surrounds should suit the crowd-averse malt sipper. It has over 1,500 whiskies including 1863 (yes) to 2000 vintages. The labels are collected from all over the world, and the history on show can definitely be intimidating for budding connoisseurs \u2013 the book-like menu certainly doesn\u2019t help much, either. But once you take a seat \u2013 either at the bar or on one of the chesterfield couches \u2013 the friendly staff and knowledgeable service unfurl a bit of the perceived stuffiness of the space.\nThese warriors are laying waste to tired ideas of what a great taproom should be, with a minimalist space that looks and smells like a modernist log cabin, and rare brews from throughout Europe and North America. This 23-tap bar on gentrified Tyrwhitt Road gets its name from the Singapore Chinese Druggists Association, which it shares the building with. Beer geeks have an advanced selection of imperial stouts, IPAs and sour beers by the likes of Mikkeller, To \u00d8l and Prairie Artisan Ales to\u00a0imbibe from $6.\nTanglin\nThis dapper lounge with accents of teak and British racing green is a handsome\u00a0den that still retains a\u00a0relaxed, tropical resort\u00a0vibe. With private booths and plenty of wicker sofas, it's easy to spend the entire night here and lose track of time. Embark on a journey through Singapore\u2019s history with drinks inspired by five key districts on the island: Orchard, Chinatown, Little India, Boat Quay and Marina Bay, with each section using different ingredients to tell the story of the place. Orchard \u2013 a spot once covered with farms and spice gardens before its current life as Singapore\u2019s glitzy shopping\u00a0belt \u2013 features fresh and fruity drinks such as Botanic Royal ($27), a Champagne cocktail with a Southeast Asian twist of jackfruit and kaffir.\nRochor\nAt this second-storey den along hip and happening Haji Lane, you're expected to pull up a seat at the bar and share your life story. From there, the expert bar team led by David Koh creates a bespoke cocktail ($20-25) that captures the mood of your tale with its range of elixirs, mixers and house-made syrups. Koh keeps the programming organic and fluid by procuring interesting ingredients and inspirations like Kyoho grapes and kaya toast for the surprise drinks.\nChinatown\nEmbark on a journey through Singapore's history through the drinks at Nutmeg and Clove. Asian flavours\u00a0play a dominant part of the flavour profiles here, with cocktails inspired by the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings \u2013 a series of 477 watercolour paintings of the flora and fauna of Singapore and Malacca. The menu showcases regional fruits like the pomegranate and guava in drinks like the Popping Grenade ($22) and Why Guava? ($22) as well as spices and vegetables like pepper and sweet potato in the Pepper Mate ($22) and Scotch & Chips ($22).\nEvery evening, Free the Robot's coffee and sandwiches make way for Bitters & Love's bespoke cocktails and singalong sessions to its killer playlist. Order the famed Kaya Toast cocktail ($26), complete with a slice of bread dolloped with kaya. It joins other locally inspired cocktails on the menu including the Nonya Confessions and head bartender Naz Arjuna's bespoke creations.\nRun by Daiki Kanetaka, who's trained under Bar High Five's legendary Hidetsugu Ueno, D.Bespoke puts everything we love about Japanese precision and eye for detail into a bar. The 28-seater shophouse speakeasy hides behind a lifestyle retail front selling the bar\u2019s glassware and leather products. Inside, Kanetaka\u00a0puts his 16 years of experience to work and you're expected to trust him entirely \u2013 guests aren't told how much the food or drinks cost but there's a minimum spend of $60 per person so you're in for a surprise and a treat.\nCity Hall\nThis cosy caf\u00e9 that serves brunch by day and hearty plates by night is no pretentious cocktail den. Tess Bar & Kitchen doesn't take itself too seriously \u2013 the d\u00e9cor features a couple of offbeat details like dog-shaped cushions and plays a fun track of \u201990s dance music. However, the bar programme is run by award-winning bartender Boo Jing Heng who knows a thing or two about crafting some tasty tipples. Try some of his competition cocktails like the Guatemalan Old Fashioned ($20) or customise your own martini.\nOnce a shophouse that used to offer manicures by day and drinks by night \u2013 hence its name that highlights the dual personalities of the space \u2013 Jekyll & Hyde is now all about the drinks. The quiet bar offers bespoke cocktails as well as a short list of signatures its grown over the years. Most interestingly, look out for Mr Bean ($23), a dou hua inspired cocktail with butterscotch liqeuer, kaya, frangelico\u00a0and vodka.\nHoused in JW Marriott Singapore and a former military forum, the 55-seater speciality cocktail bar offers a heritage-inspired drinks menu featuring barrel-aged classics and homemade infusions. Its speciality\u00a0cocktail range from redefined classics like the Superior Martini to heritage-inspired concoctions like the My Old Man for those looking for a crafted experience.\nOrchard\nLooking for the best martinis in town? Then head towards the bar that\u2019s named after the tipple: Martini Bar. A firm favourite in the city\u2019s vibrant bar scene, the cocktail joint at the Grand Hyatt Singapore is one of the city's first. You might appreciate its creative concoctions such as gummy bear, apple truffle and blueberry citrus, but we prefer to stick with the tried and true cucumber martini whenever we find ourselves here. 'Mezzatime'\u00a0happens from 5pm to 9pm daily and is the best time to visit. During these four hours, all martinis, handcrafted gin and tonics, wines and house pours are priced at $14 per glass.\nMarina Bay\nSingapore is the first international outpost for Wolfgang Puck's modern Cali-fusion restaurant and he couldn't have picked a better spot. Perched at the top of Marina Bay Sands, the breezy bar has panoramic views, dim lighting and\u00a0a friendly bar team that makes you feel right at home. In true American fashion, the cocktails like the Run Like Hell ($26), a light and refreshing tipple of Botanist gin, elderflower, lavender, come in goblets the size of your face.\nOrchard\nBefore dismissing Uma Uma Ramen as yet another Japanese noodle house, take a closer look at the other door by the entrance. It snakes down into The Horse\u2019s Mouth, a sleek basement bar lit by boxy paper lanterns and peppered with quirky objets d\u2019art, such as a hanging origami display. The concoctions are just as classy and relatively spirit-forward, a style that stems from the bar staff\u2019s training in Japanese techniques. Most drinks are crafted to showcase various Nihon ingredients and, of course,\u00a0sake exclusive to The Horse\u2019s Mouth.\nOrchard\nNamed after St Regis founded John Jacob Astor IV, the swish bar\u2019s polished red leather seats, wooden finishings and artwork from Picasso\u2019s Toros series set the stage for a sophisticated, after-work tipple \u2013 choose from over 50 cocktails including their daredevil-suited signature Chili Padi Mary (a Bloody Mary spiked with chinese ginger, lemon grass and blazing-hot chillies), vintage champagnes, wines and spirits.\nTanjong Pagar\nThe curtains are drawn and the scene is set. Lanterns cast a dim red glow over the bar as you settle into your seat, waiting for the show to begin. Without missing a beat, the waiter descends upon the table with bottles of sake, each more beautiful in taste than the last to keep you enthralled throughout the evening. Like the Japanese art of Kabuki, which combines dance and drama, Kabuke\u00a0combines sake and bar bites in an accessible way. With tasting flights and detailed notes on each sake available, this is the place to learn about the spirit sans any pretense.\nFor casual drinks after work This unassuming bar tucked away on the 10th floor of Yotel serves surprisingly good cocktails. The hidden find is run by food and beverage manager, As\u2019ad Isnin, who\u2019s won competitions run by Barcardi and 42 Below Vodka. He splits the bar menu into four different sections: bittersweet, tropical, sours and timeless so that there\u2019s something for everyone to enjoy. And with cocktails priced from $18, there\u2019s even more reason to make your way up to Komyuniti.\nTanjong Pagar\nYet another second-floor shophouse unit on Amoy Street, this watering hole stocks more craft beers, spirits beyond Spiffy\u2019s already extensive selection of gin and tonic waters, and a barrel-aged cocktail programme you can buy and enjoy at the tavern-like establishment. In the daytime, the bar is take over by Dapper Coffee operations if you'd rather trade alcohol for caffeine.\nRaffles Place\nHidden in plain sight, The Secret Mermaid is the alter ego of Shinkansen, a design-your-own salad bar in the CBD. The shared space, outfitted with black grilles and brass piping, morphs into a hole-in-the-wall cocktail bar after five in the evening. Bottles of gin, rum, tequila, vodka and whisky occupy every nook and cranny in this miniscule hideout, and the bar also has one of the largest collections of American craft spirits.\nWith over 100 labels of gin sitting slick behind its counter, have a martini or gin and tonic your way at Cin Cin. Some recommended gins to try include the Del Gin Professore Madame ($17 glass, $200 bottle), The Corsair Steampunk ($22 glass, $300 bottle) and the Sipsmith VJOP (Very Junipery Over Proof) ($22 glass, $300 bottle). The characters of these gins are so unusual it\u2019ll surprise even the most seasoned of gin drinkers.\nMarina Bay\nModelled after Gordon Ramsay's casual restaurant of the same name in London, this two-storey restaurant has some excellent cocktail options for those in the Marina Bay area. Sit at the al fresco area that's best for people watching \u2013 there are joggers, curious tourists and shopaholics lugging plenty of bags \u2013 and sip on classic and innovative tipples as well as an array of wines.\nCity Hall\nNo list of Singapore bars would be complete without the legendary Long Bar at Raffles Hotel, the birthplace of the iconic Singapore Sling. Don't expect upscale, chichi\u00a0vibes despite its five-star surrounds, the bar is littered with peanut shells so the ladies should probably leave the Blahniks at home. There are a couple of variations of the sling ($25) available to try if you must. Here's a toast to history in one of the oldest bars in Singapore.\nBars and pubs, Cocktail bars\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "[Updated for 2019!]\nLast time, we offered you the tips you needed to know before going clubbing in Taipei. If you missed them or want to refresh your memory, you can find them here: 10 Things You Must Know About Clubs In Taipei\nNow that you have everything in mind, it is time to choose where you prefer to go among the numerous and diverse clubs you might find in Taipei. Here are our recommendations to help with your decision: we offer you the 12 clubs you should definitely know in Taipei 2019!\nNEAR TAIPEI 101/ATT4FUN :\nPreviously known as Elektro, AI Club is another key element of the nightlife in Taipei. Located inside ATT4FUN (7th floor but the entrance is on the 6th floor), the club is mostly known to foreigners for its free all-you-can-drink nights for students early on Thursdays and Sundays. On those days, people start queuing from 10pm (although the club opens a bit later than that) in order to ensure their free entrance. Once you get through the door, a beautifully lit room with a long row of tables on one side, and the dance floor (sadly quite small) on the other, awaits. Enjoy the drinking and dancing before the clubs gets too crowded after 1am.\nOn the other days, the club is sadly not all-you-can-drink, and you will not see as many foreigners. The crowd tends to be mostly young, while still being a bit classy (tables, champagne\u2026) but not too pretentious. The DJ will usually play some famous EDM songs or sometimes loud electronic music. If you want to breathe a bit, it is possible to take the stairs inside the club to the floor above and observe Taipei\u2019s youth energetically dancing.\nN\u00b022 Songshou Road, Xinyi District, Taipei City 110, Ta\u00efwan\nKlash is located in NEO19 and has been one of Taiwan\u2019s trendiest nightlife places of the past few years. Its black & white design, the music, as well as numerous advertisements for it in movie theaters made it the new cool place for young Hip-Hop lovers.\nThe queue to enter the club is often really long, starting outside and often reaching the Family Mart nearby; once you entered, you still have to face an airport-type security check, so it is advised to come there early to avoid an even longer wait.\nThe bar of this all-you-can-drink club tends to be a bit more chaotic that other Taiwanese clubs. People are likely to cut lines on the sides in order to get their drinks faster.\nFranny, previously known as Babe18, is famous among foreigners for being a cheap all-you-can-drink club (especially on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays where it is free entrance even for guys before a certain hour) and with a much younger crowd of locals often aged 18 or 19. The bar is easy to get a drink from (and with drinks like J\u00e4ger or Absinthe shots), and the tables are a bit further away from the dance floor (smaller but usually not too crowded excepted on weekends). The music starts slowly with Hip-Hop and usually shifts into EDM/commercial music around midnight. Special shout-out to the Lollipop distributor!\nThe club opens at 10pm. We'd suggest you to arrive at that exact time to enter directly and get the early discount. If you arrive 20 minutes later, you may find yourself queuing for a very long time as the staff takes their time on purpose, while also letting the table queue enter first.\nYou can find IKON in NEO19, halfway between Klash and Chess. This all-you-can drink club is usually given the cold shoulder by foreigners for its past reputation: Lava. Before getting rebranded, the club had the habit of organizing stripteases and wet T-shirts competitions. However, it has now considerably changed and was renovated into a much fancier place.\nThe drink menu is also much more diverse than other clubs, with tons of cocktails to choose from. So if you want to drink and stay among locals, you can definitely go there!\nOTHERS CLUBS:\n\u53f0\u5317\u5e02\u5927\u5b89\u5340\u5fe0\u5b5d\u6771\u8def\u56db\u6bb5201\u865f5\u6a13\n5F., No.201, Sec. 4, Zhongxiao E. Rd., Da\u2019an Dist., Taipei City 106\nClassy with a cool design, Omni is one of the fanciest clubs in Taipei. The electronic music there is unlike the usual EDM, and the sound-system is impressive. The entrance fee is pretty high and the drinks might be a bit expensive compared to other clubs; it can definitely be worth it though. If budget's an issue, you should check the Wednesday parties (Ladies Night) where the entrance is free for girls and the guys can easily be on PRs lists and not pay anything (be careful about the dress code though!). On other days, you generally will not find many foreigners inside, and the locals are pretty easy to talk to (you might even get invited to a table).\nThe people there are usually older than clubs around ATT (more around 23 to 30 years old in Omni) and you can always go to Kor: a bar nearby located on the same floor, with a nice atmosphere but where the music is less loud. It can be ideal to go there to take a break from Omni and talk to your friends before going back dancing later.\nFamous foreigners spot, Triangle is a dancing bar held by French people with different theme nights depending on the days of the week (KTV night, 90s songs, 80s songs...). The drinks are affordable and the music is usually good, with foreign DJs coming to mix there. The student nights on Wednesdays with free entrance (and free drinks early in the night) gather a lot of people that will dance inside or stay outside the club where you can sit freely at tables (maybe with some drinks for the 7/11 nearby!). Despite being a bit further away than most clubs, the nice atmosphere of Maji Square really makes up for it!\n\u53f0\u5317\u5e02\u5927\u5b89\u5340\u7f85\u65af\u798f\u8def\u4e8c\u6bb567\u865fB1\nB2., No. 67, Section 2, Roosevelt Rd, Da\u2019an District, Taipei City, 106\n3F., No.456, Sec. 4, Xinyi Rd., Xinyi Dist., Taipei City 110\nTECHNO CLUBS:\n\u5927\u5b89\u5340\u5e02\u6c11\u5927\u9053\u4e09\u6bb5198\u865fB1\nNo. 198, Section 3, Civic Blvd, Da\u2019an District, Taipei City, Ta\u00efwan 106\nNot far from Gongguan and next to the river, Pipe is another underground club where you can listen to a different style of music than the usual commercial music you find in Taipei. The place is also relatively dark but the outside of the club is really nice for sitting and calmly listening to the music (a bit like in Triangle).\n\u2605 OUR TIMETABLE SUGGESTION\nMonday : Take a rest and recover\nTuesday : Take a rest and recover (or Wave for the real party animals)\nWednesday : Triangle/Omni\nThursday : AI\nFriday : Wave\nSaturday : B1/Klash\nSunday : Franny\nAbout Us\nTaiwan Inside Out is a blog by FRNCi, sharing local tips and info of local events in Taiwan, with the focus on helping travelers visiting Taiwan to get the insight of local culture and offering the chance to explore authentic beauty.\nCategories\n"

Don\u2019t worry, even if you were to sample the entire cocktail collection of the bar, you wouldn\u2019t get tipsy as the gummy bears don\u2019t contain alcohol. That being said, they still capture the flavours of the actual cocktail pretty accurately.\nTheir wildest cocktail flavour is Supercar, and is charged with notes of petrol, leather, smoke and metal. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s perfectly safe to consume. If you prefer erring on the safer side, we recommend giving their classic cocktails a shot.

The drink was created with a feminine pink hue to pass off as nothing more than fruit juice when it\u2019s actually infused with a clear base of gin.\nThe bar has a unique culture of encouraging guests to sweep peanut shells off tables so when you see the floor littered with peanut remnants, don\u2019t be surprised. We\u2019re quite sure this is the only place in Singapore that doesn\u2019t penalise people for \u201clittering\u201d.\nAddress: 1 Beach Road, Singapore 189673\nOpening hours: Daily, 11AM-11PM\nPotato Head Folk\u2019s Roof Top Bar is a 2-storey bar set in the heart of Tiong Bahru.

By day, this place sells sashimi and salad with a Japanese storefront, but by night, the restaurant transforms into a watering hole that serves up cocktails with ingredients like bacon and salmon.\nThat\u2019s right, bacon and salmon have now become infused with vodka and it\u2019s a crowd favourite too. Their Bakon Vodka has a smokey and peppery flavour to it and it\u2019s also gluten-free so those who\u2019re health conscious, don\u2019t worry.\nA signature cocktail to check out is Devil In The Details ($20), which contains rum infused with pink dragonfruit, lime and burlesque bitters.\nAddress: 10 Collyer Quay, #B1-09, Ocean Financial Centre, Singapore 049315\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri: 5PM-11PM | Closed on Sat and Sun\n10.

Games you can find here include Metal Slug and Pacman.\nTheme aside, their cocktails are just as enticing. Donna Summer ($20) is the house\u2019s signature cocktail, which features a fruity mixture of strawberry puree, fresh lime juice, orange liqueur and white rum, topped with a strawberry slice.\nThe best part? All the drinks are inclusive of GST and there\u2019s no service charge, so you won\u2019t be shook when footing the bill.\nRead our article on NINETEEN80 here .\nAddress: 21 Tanjong Pagar Road, #01-05, Singapore 088444\nOpening hours: Tue and Thu: 5.30PM-1AM | Wed and Fri: 5.30PM-3AM | Sat: 7PM-4AM (Closed on Mondays)\nTelephone: 9183 6073\nLocated directly opposite Orchard Central, No. 5 Emerald Hill is both a convenient and pocket-friendly spot for a couple of drinks.\nEvery day from 9AM-1PM, the bar offers up 1-for-1 martinis and we recommend ordering the Lychee and Apple Martini (2 for $20) in a pair to maximise this deal.

If you\u2019re wondering how the bar got its name, it\u2019s actually a play on how Singaporeans pronounce \u201croof\u201d as \u201cloof\u201d.\nLittle Pink Dot ($19) is one of the bar\u2019s signature cocktails that\u2019s served in a lightbulb glass\nAside from celebrating the quirky side of Singlish, the bar also takes a twist to our local bubble tea flavours.

The Timbre that we all know and love is now Timbre X. There are a total of 4 outlets around, but we\u2019re recommending the flagship bar at The Substation.\nThe bar was recently renovated and we like its new look with the foliage and fairy lights dangling from ceilings.

And the Marina Bay Sands institution just relaunched with brand new digs and entertainment programme that\u2019ll perch it even higher above the other cloud-infused upstarts. Here\u2019s what you can expect.\nThe decor\nC\u00c9 LA VI\u2019s revamp pays homage to our South-East Asian heritage. Its architecture and interior design takes inspiration from, the club breathlessly tells us, \u2018the wonders of Asian civilisation\u2019 \u2013 so expect tributes to 16th-century Javanese poetry and prints, 18th-century Balinese woodwork, and the architecture of the lost 9th-century Khmer empire. Vertical gardens, stencil-etched timber and other rainforest-inspired elements turn the club/lounge into a lush, sky-high oasis amid a concrete jungle.\nThe music\nOn to the soul of the night: the entertainment. The club already has a reputation for incredible parties, but in the coming months there will be seismic shifts as a result of the overhaul. \u2018A lot of clubs have a certain style of genre,\u2019 says entertainment manager Joshua Pillai, \u2018but we have a very versatile sound.\u2019\nFind evidence of that in C\u00c9 LA VI\u2019s programme for every night of the week. Mondays are devoted to nu-disco, Tuesdays four-to-the-floor house, Wednesdays the fairer sex, Thursday tech-house and Fridays R&B. Saturdays turn to Top 40 hits, while Sundays cap the week off with boogie-friendly Afro-Latin funk \u2019n\u2019 soul.\nThe food\nGrabbing the trend by the scruff of its neck, C\u00c9 LA VI\u2019s menu hops on the modern Asian bandwagon, marrying Western techniques with flavours from the region. Think angel hair pasta topped with tobiko and spring onion ($22), 8-hour sous vide salmon basted in miso teriyaki sauce ($42) and beef carpaccio loaded with fried shallots ($28) \u2013 because those crispy kernels make everything taste better.\nLadies night\nThe clue is in the name: Diamond Life. Yes, it smacks of \u2018the high life\u2019, but which lady doesn\u2019t want to walk away with a piece of jewellery, designer bag, spas, holidays and other luxe pursuits? Every #humpday, one partygoer gets to bag a prize \u2013 and this month, it\u2019ll be pearl and gold bracelets from Trollbeads. The only question is, how long before everyone else cottons on?\nBY: KRIS LYNCH\nWhat's On\nThe first date can't be after the second date\nNo events found for the selected dates\nNightlife\nC\u00c9 LA VI presents Glowed Up\nBoogie towards the end of the week with C\u00c9 LA VI's Thursday night series: Glowed Up.

I feel that since Ce La Vi is on Marina Bay Sands, it removes one of the most iconic buildings from the Singapore skyline when you view it from here. It only becomes recognisable through other well-known buildings such as, The Esplanade. Especially at night, it is not as familiar to someone who is not familiar with the Singapore skyline. On the plus side, it is a nice place to have a night out. I liked the club part as the DJ plays some pretty catchy tunes! There's a variety throughout the nice, so something for everyone. The bartenders are efficient and have a good attitude as they make and serve drinks, which is makes your night!\nHelpful?\nFeatured\nI've lived in Singapore for several years and I frequent this establishment often. The view is beautiful and the atmosphere is generally good. Nevertheless what happened to us tonight was unforgivable.\nWe go here more or less every Friday night however what befell us tonight will stop me (and hopefully you) in my tracks.\nThere was a group of 10 of us (mixed) in the VIP/ Members area and we were minding our own business. The table next to us was causing a bit of a ruckus but as it didn't affect us we didn't really mind. until one of the boys walked over starred us down and then knocked our bottle off the table intentionally he was clearly a drunken idiot gunning for a fight. Though this was inexcusable we let it slide. However the management's reaction I cannot let get away.\nThey just let him get away and go back to his table. There was a bouncer standing right next to us and saw the whole event unfold and yet nothing, no repercussions at all whatsoever.\nNot only did they allow him to stay in the establishment, they defended him and permitted him to carry on being boisterous and unruly while he threatened us from afar.\nIt was the last thing I expected from an international brand in a country where I once perceived behavior to be fair and justly managed.\nThe bouncers response was that \" They spent money and you spent money so I have given them a warning\".\nDon't be fooled for all its glitz and glamour that might seduce an unwitting and well paying patron, they run by some rule that money counts for everything.\nI (and my friends) felt threatened and unsafe at such an unruly establishment where they allow \"Money to talk\" in such a way that such behavior is acceptable. The guests where allowed to stay on and continue gesturing and threatening us for the rest of the night when we were just trying to enjoy an innocent Friday night out with friends.\nI therefore beseech you to not patronage them with your support when they run such a unprofessional and unruly management of their clientele. As an international brand they should regulate and manage their crowd so that the majority of their patrons establish a safe and light hearted environment not an environment that festers animosity and un-comfortableness.\nFor the premium they dictate that's the least they can do.\nUnfortunately they have lost themselves numerous well paying regulars ( to the VP) that have held them in high regard until now. In a city that offers so much variety and options this has now become one that I would negatively endorse as there are so many more options that would not allow this kind of behavior to occur.\nThank you.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "| No Comments\nNormally when we travel, we visit the best places, see the best sights, and eat at the best restaurants. We research everything in advance, look at Yelp reviews, and worry a little bit about the price. It\u2019s fun, but since what \u2018best\u2019 usually means is \u2018most popular\u2019, some would say it\u2019s not very fulfilling.\nYou\u2019re always in crowded areas, trying to find the best deals, you do things everyone\u2019s seen and done before. And if you travel often, after a certain point all tourist spots start to feel similar. You see the same things \u2013 crowds, cameras, glowing reviews \u2013 and you start to feel a bit tired of it all.\nIf you want to really see a place, to plunge into its culture and to have a longer trip for less, nature travel is an excellent option. If you\u2019re a nature-lover, I very strongly recommend trying it out at least once in your life.\nSo what is nature travel?\nNature travel is when you simplify things and step out of the city. You stay in small towns or villages, cook your own food or eat local food, and your sightseeing spots are forests, rivers and mountains. You travel for nature and stay away from \u2018popular\u2019 areas, in short.\nStaying in a village is necessary because you won\u2019t find unpolluted nature near a city. Wildlife sanctuaries and zoos aren\u2019t the same as a virgin forest. They\u2019re managed and\u2026constructed, almost. If you can find a city that provides great value nature-wise, go for it!\nCooking your own food isn\u2019t a requirement either \u2013 it\u2019s a sort of side effect. I\u2019ve found that hotels in small towns aren\u2019t usually very nice, but for some reason Airbnb has some great listings. There are clearly others like us who seek out such places, so property owners have capitalized on this idea. When you stay at an Airbnb and have the option to cook, it\u2019s safe to assume you\u2019ll cook at least some of your meals. It\u2019s enjoyable \u2013 and it\u2019s a good option for picky eaters like myself.\nI\u2019m a big fan of the concept of nature traveling. I\u2019ve travelled widely throughout the country this way, staying at small, unknown places. I\u2019ve stayed with locals, had funny local food, fed pet goats and chickens, watched the starry sky at night, and done it all for half the cost I\u2019d have expected. I didn\u2019t get to pose with monuments, but I had plenty of fun nevertheless.\nSo now, let\u2019s discuss why this is so awesome!\n9 reasons why nature travel rocks\nThere are so, so many reasons why this is a great idea. In my opinion, the reduced price and the sights are enough, but if you want some more reasons here they are:\n1. It combines the best of two things\nIf you like to travel and nature, this concept basically combines the two in a way that ensures maximum efficiency. You get maximum immersion for minimum cost. That is, you get to enjoy everything you like and have an intense, memorable experience for very little cost. More about that in the next point, which is\u2026\n2. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive\nYou must have noticed that airfare and hotel rates go up during high season. If you\u2019re in a big city and close to the center of the city, the rates go higher still. So it makes sense that when you step out of the city and get to a remote area, the prices will be dirt-cheap. The maintenance and property costs there are low, so people are willing to rent their place out for less. If you want to cook at \u2018home\u2019 and go shopping for veggies locally, you\u2019ll find their prices pleasantly low too. No more shrink-wrapped, sprayed bananas!\n3. You experience the real culture\nCities are a melting pot of cultures and cuisines. If you visit Holland, you won\u2019t find only Dutch people around. Tourists love that place, so you\u2019ll find lots of them, along with immigrants and others. In a small town, however, you\u2019re almost certain to find only locals. So if you really want to experience the local culture, this is your chance.\n4. You experience new things\nI don\u2019t just mean the culture and food \u2013 I mean things you couldn\u2019t possibly experience in the city. You\u2019ll see farms, virgin forests, rare birds, and the beautiful night sky. I live in a moderate-size city and the light pollution here is shockingly high. The first time I went on a nature trip, I almost cried. I sat outside in the cold till my throat hurt. The night sky is just so beautiful \u2013 and I could see it from my bloody balcony!\n5. You get to \u2018live\u2019 there\nIn a village that\u2019s small enough for nature travel, you\u2019re not likely to find a good hotel. You will, however, find some excellent Airbnb places \u2013 usually out in the outskirts. It\u2019s funny how this works. So you effectively \u2018rent\u2019 a place and get to make your own meals and lock up the home when you leave. It\u2019s different from having a room in a hotel. You feel like you\u2019re actually living in the village.\n6. Language barrier \u2013 frustrating or amusing?\nWhen you go to Italy, you imagine you\u2019ll have to \u201csi, si\u201d your way through the country. It can be a letdown when you find that Italians speak perfect English. In a village, that won\u2019t be the case. Of course, it can present a difficulty when you\u2019re at the store saying \u2018two eggs\u2019 loudly over and over and frantically making chicken sounds, but isn\u2019t that the sort of thing you secretly wanted? A language barrier is fun \u2013 it means you\u2019re in a foreign place. Do make sure you have a translation book, though. Just in case.\n7. You have a longer stay\nI went on a 5-day trip to Singapore back in 2015, and imagine my surprise when I found that for the money I spent on that trip, I can spend 12 days in a Belgian village! Since you\u2019re spending less money, you can extend the trip\u2019s duration.\n8. It\u2019s so darn peaceful!\nNature travel feels incredible, seriously. The area isn\u2019t crowded, there is minimal traffic, the natural landscape is beautiful and unpolluted, and the food is healthy \u2013 since you\u2019ll often be the one cooking it. It\u2019s a great feeling. When compared to the noise, speed and pollution of the city, it feels like heaven. Make sure you log out of your email and Facebook account, though. Don\u2019t want your phone pinging while you\u2019re nature-gazing!\n9. It\u2019s different from anything you\u2019ve experienced before\nSometimes you feel like you need a change. If your trips are all starting to feel the same, if you want to do something different that you\u2019ll remember, to experience something new \u2013 well, here you go! If you like nature and travel, this is the best combination I can think of, apart from perhaps an adventure sports trip.\nA summary of nature travel\nSo we\u2019ve been through a quick explanation of the term and the benefits it offers, but what are the ingredients of the perfect nature-based trip? What factors are crucial and which ones are variable? Here\u2019s a summary.\nIngredients:\n\u2013 A sparsely populated area that\u2019s away from major cities\n\u2013 If it\u2019s an international trip, make sure the language, cuisine, weather and political situation are all okay\n\u2013 An area that\u2019s easy to reach from the airport, and preferably one with a lower airfare\n\u2013 A good place to stay \u2013 look on popular travel websites and Airbnb, ask any questions you have\n\u2013 A beautiful natural landscape. You are traveling for nature, after all. Make sure there are things to see and do.\n\u2013 Learn snippets of the local language (\u2018yes, please\u2019, \u2018no\u2019, \u2018sorry\u2019, \u2018I don\u2019t speak Russian, I am a foreigner\u2019, etc.) and conduct some final research\n\u2013 It\u2019s booking time!\nFlexible points:\nI would say finding a \u2018good\u2019 place and cheap airfare are variable. When you consider the big picture, these are two things that don\u2019t matter very much. If you\u2019re spending thousands on a trip, saving a couple hundred on airfare won\u2019t make a huge difference.\nSecondly, the place where you stay doesn\u2019t need to be particularly \u2018nice\u2019. It improves the experience, but I find it\u2019s not strictly necessary. If I were in a shack (which was safe), I\u2019d still enjoy talking to locals, roaming through the forest and making my own food. The other points, I think, are fairly crucial.\nGoal:\n\u2013 To experience the place and its culture\n\u2013 To spend as much time as possible exploring the place, watching nature and talking to people\n\u2013 To relax and come back refreshed\nI am planning a nature travel trip to somewhere in Europe next year \u2013 a trip where I rent an Airbnb in a small town and spend all day outdoors, meeting the local folk and observing nature. I\u2019m a birdwatcher, so I expect I\u2019ll be one busy grasshopper. Stay tuned for travel tips as I plan for the trip, and an update with my travel experience! Interestingly, I don\u2019t speak any languages except English, so this should be fun. \u201cJa, ja.

They want nature - trees, mountains, corals and caves - instead.\nAccording to the latest statistics from the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, nature- based tourism accounts for about 20 per cent of total international travel and continues to grow.\nForests are a top priority for Ms Bee Choo, 52. \"I seek out places that are still wild, where the forest is still intact and the birds and animals are still there,\" she says.\nThe coordinator for Bangkok- based Hornbill Research Foundation says she avoids travelling to cities because they all look the same to her. \"I can eat and shop in Singapore. Why should I do that overseas?\" she says.\nWith thousands of beautiful destinations to choose from, identifying an interest is helpful when searching for your nature-based getaway.\nBooking.com has a new Destination Finder feature, which allows travellers to search for destinations and accommodation based on interests, which can be anything from hiking to surfing to food. Travellers can input \"whale watching\" and \"Europe\", for example, and a list of recommended destinations based on customer ratings will appear.\nNature photographer John Arifin, in his 60s, seeks out bird life. For the past 30 years, he has travelled around Asia, revisiting destinations such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Borneo, to see them.\nHe knows that November to February are good months to see wintering birds in northern Thailand, while March to May is nesting season for many resident rainforest birds. Getting to know the environments and habits of wild animals is one of the things he loves best.\nUnlike many young people, who he says expect everything at their fingertips, he finds joy in taking the time to dig deep and immerse himself in the landscape.\n\"In the wild, you don't see animals arrive in front of you. You have to search for them. You have to be patient,\" he says.\n\"It's about taking the time to discover and understand something you haven't seen before and, when you finally see it, it's like hitting the jackpot. It's a rewarding and fulfilling experience,\" he says.\nHolidays spent observing the unique native wildlife in destinations such as Madagascar and Botswana, and regular visits to Fraser's Hill, a hill station in Pahang, Malaysia, have changed the life of Dr Vilma D'Rozario. She will be leaving her career as an associate professor of psychological studies at the National Institute of Education to devote herself to nature conservation at the end of the year.\nHer interest in nature travel started about 20 years ago and turned into an obsession, she says.\nShe volunteered with Malaysian Conservation Alliance For Tigers (Mycat) as a volunteer to help protect the few remaining wild tigers in the forests of Pahang and, before long, was coordinating volunteer trips with Mycat.\n\"I find peace in wild spaces, especially the rainforest. When I am in the forest, I feel like I am part of the eco-system. I feel very much at home.\"\nFrom mountains to caves to coral reefs, here are seven holiday suggestions to keep nature lovers happy.\nWorld's largest cave in Vietnam\nThe recent discovery of Hang Son Doong, the largest known cave in the world, is a humbling reminder of how much of the world is still unexplored.\nLocated in the heart of the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park in the Quang Binh province of central Vietnam, the cave was discovered by a local man in the 1990s, who promptly lost its location. It was almost 20 years before he found it again and alerted the authorities. It was explored by the British Cave Research Association in 2009 and 2010.\nOver 5km long, with sections reaching up to 200m tall and 150m wide, Hang Son Doong was created by the Rao Thuong River, which carved its way through the limestone mountains.\nInside, adventurous travellers can see the sun shine through enormous sinkholes and camp in vast caverns and explore the otherworldly interior of the cave, which contains clouds and rivers and jungles and stalagmites up to 80m high, the tallest encountered.\nThe cave was opened to the public in 2013, but only one company, Oxalis Adventure Tours ( oxalis.com.vn ) can conduct tours there.\nThe tours take a maximum of 10 guests at a time and the company claims that fewer people have seen the inside of Hang Son Doong than have stood on the summit of Mount Everest.\nFrom February to August, Oxalis offers weekly departures for its four-day, three-night expedition into the cave. Safety gear is provided for participants, who must be aged 18 years or older. They must be physically fit enough to walk more than 25km in the jungle, cross knee- deep underground rivers, complete rock climbs and traverse rocky terrain throughout the tour. It costs US$3,000 (S$4,000) a person, with meals. However, it does not include the necessary one night before and after the expedition in a nearby farmstay. Last year, Oxalis introduced a five-day, four-night photography-focused expedition of the caves, which costs US$4,000. It will continue this year.\nOnly 500 to 700 expedition spots are available every year and they sell out within minutes of their release. Fortunately, Hang Son Doong is one of many caves in the national park.\nOxalis offers less strenuous tours to some of these other caves, including the Hang Tien and Tu Lan caves, which are also stunning. The best time to go is during the dry season, from February to August.\nSea treasures in Indonesia\nScuba divers are always looking for something new, says Mr Lester Kwok, master instructor at Orpheus Dive shop in Zion Road, so naming the world's best dive spot is nigh impossible.\n\"Scuba divers are fickle-minded. Every diver wants to see something new or have a new experience every time he dives,\" he says. But when pressed to name a favourite spot, he points to Manado in Indonesia's North Sulawesi province.\nA diving destination with enough diversity for almost all interests and skill levels, the small city is the launching point for some of the world's most renowned dive destinations, where hundreds of types of coral, brightly coloured fish, turtles, rays and even whales are found at a variety of dive sites for beginner and advanced divers.\nDiving around Manado is generally separated into two popular straits, the Lembeh Strait and Bunaken National Marine Park, one of the most pristine marine parks in Indonesia.\nLembeh is one of the world's best and most remarkable destinations for muck diving, in which divers scour the silty sea bed for marine life. This is where divers find weird-looking fish such as the black hairy frogfish, minuscule pygmy seahorses and mimic octopus, which can imitate the shape of another species to avoid predators.\n\"It is also popular among underwater photographers as the black sand provides a good contrast and background for their images,\" he says.\nAnyone looking for a blue-sea dive heads to Bunaken, where sites range from 5 to 40m deep and the water is so clear that visibility is usually 20 to 40m. It is the perfect environment in which to admire abundant soft coral and huge schools of fish.\nMr Kwok, who has been diving for 25 years, has taken dive trips to Manado every other month for the past 15 years and it is still one of his top all-round dive destinations with memorable highlights.\n\"Over the years, we've seen large schools of manta rays, dugongs and even migrating orca whales from the surface of the water,\" he says.\nYou can enjoy diving around Manado all year round, but overall dive conditions are best from March to October.\nWhale of a time in Alaska\nWhale watching is one of the most popular activities in Alaska and it is no wonder.\nAlaska's bounty of deep waterways, protected islands and rich feeding grounds make it prime whale-watching territory.\nGray, humpback, minke, orca and even the elusive beluga whales have a presence here.\nWhales can be seen from most Alaskan ports, although the cities of Juneau, Whittier and Seward are the most popular launching points for whale-watching tours, which cost from US$79 (S$105) to upwards of US$200 a person, depending on the size of the boat and the length of the tours ( www.alaska.org/things-to-do/whale-watching ).\nEvery spring, gray whales migrate off the coast of Alaska on their way to their summer feeding grounds in the Bering and Chukchi seas.\nIn May, the humpbacks and orcas arrive and swim around the waters of south-east Alaska until September. Humpbacks are particularly prevalent. Hundreds of them migrate to the cold waters of Alaska during the summer to feed and nurture their young.\nKenai Fjords National Park and Prince William Sound are the most popular whale-watching locations, where travellers can also admire the surrounding glaciers and spot other marine life, such as sea otters, harbour seals, porpoises and sea lions, which live in the sound all year round.\nWhen Mr Olie Lever, 35, visited Alaska in 2014, he spotted a number of humpbacks, a minke whale and a pod of orcas. \"It was fantastic. I also saw porpoises, dolphins and sea lions, making for a fantastic day of whale watching,\" says Mr Lever, head of Americas and Antarctica for Lightfoot Travel agency.\n\"Sighting orcas for the first time was a real highlight of my Alaska trip, but witnessing a breaching humpback was an incredible experience I'd seen only on David Attenborough documentaries. It was a fantastic adventure to see grizzly bears on land and whales at sea.\"\nTo see the whales, Mr Lever took a half-day tour in a fairly small boat for fewer than 20 people, an experience which typically costs about US$200 a person.\nFor the more adventurous, he says, kayaking is also a great way to get up close to whales.\nBird watching in Uganda\nBird watchers live by their \"life list\", a record of all the bird species they have identified since they started bird watching.\nSome bird watchers set out on a bird-watching holiday with a specific rare bird in mind, but according to ecologist Albert Low, 31, for those who want to tick off as many birds as they can, the trick is to go to as many habitats as possible.\nCountries with diverse landscapes, from rainforests to mangroves to savanna, which also have reliable access to all of these habitats, are the best picks. For Mr Low, Uganda fits the bill.\nThe East African country is home to more than 1,000 species of birds and is one of the top birding destinations on the continent. During a three-week trip to Uganda three years ago, he saw about 450 species of birds across multiple eco-systems. He started at the Mabamba Swamp, close to Entebbe, about a 11/2-hour drive from Uganda's capital Kampala.\nThe freshwater wetland is home to the charismatic Shoebill Stork, which is popular with bird watchers and eco-tourists, and is one of the most sought-after bird sightings in Africa. The solitary bird, known for its unique, prehistoric-looking, shoe-like beak, is found only in tropical East-Central Africa, but is most easily seen in Uganda.\nHe then went to Kibale National Park, 76,000ha of protected rainforest famous for its diversity and density of primates, particularly chimpanzees.\nFor bird watchers, the green-breasted Pitta - one of Africa's most difficult birds to spot - is the park's highlight. Mr Low was fortunate enough to see it on his first day in the jungle. \"Some birders spend days or weeks in the jungle and never get to see it. I was lucky,\" he says.\nHis next stop was Queen Elizabeth National Park, 198,000ha of protected wilderness, including savanna and numerous freshwater habitats, home to elephants, lions and leopards, large numbers of the Nile crocodile, Cape buffalo, hippopotamus and, for bird watchers, the black-headed gonolek is the prize.\nNo trip to Uganda is complete without a visit to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, 32,000ha of lowland and mountain rainforest, which is home to gorillas and 24 of Uganda's 26 Albertine Rift endemics, birds which are found only in this region of the world.\nThe crown jewel is the African Green Broadbill, a rarely seen palm-sized bird found only in the mountains of Bwindi and adjacent Democratic Republic of Congo.\nForest bathing in Japan\nFor centuries, the Japanese have turned to forests for peace and solitude and, in 1982, the Japanese forestry ministry introduced the term \"shinrin-yoku\", or forest bathing, to promote forests as part of the country's national preventative healthcare programme.\nIt is not the same as hiking. Practitioners walk slowly, sometimes not moving at all, taking time to relax, observe their surroundings and breathe in deeply fresh forest air.\nAfter millions of dollars' worth of medical studies, forest bathing has been proven to lower blood pressure, blood glucose levels and stress hormones.\nSo, what better place to spend time surrounded by trees than in Japan, where verdant forests cover 67 per cent of the country.\nSome of the healthiest and most beautiful forests in this country are in the Tohoku region. Towada-Hachimantai National Park, which stretches across the Aomori, Akita and Iwate prefectures, has dozens of trails winding through forests of oak, cedar, cherry, dogwood, beech and maple trees. It is one of the best places to see the leaves change colour.\nFarther south, the sub-tropical island of Yakushima, off the southern coast of Kyushu, is covered by an extensive cedar forest. Past wooden walkways and stones covered in emerald moss, Yakushima's otherworldly forests contain some of Japan's oldest living trees. Known as yakusugi, the trees are at least 1,000 years old, while some are believed to be more than 7,000 years old.\nMr Masatoshi Miyake, executive director of Japan National Tourism Organisation Singapore Office, says forest bathing is ideal in Japan, where nature spots are varied and easy to find.\n\"Japan is home to an abundance of nature and each prefecture possesses a unique appeal of its own. The same spot you have visited once may offer you a brand new experience as the seasons change.\n\"Just relax and immerse yourself in the peace of the forest,\" he says.\nAlone in Bhutan's mountains\nFor travellers seeking solitude in the mountains, there is no better place than Bhutan.\nThe remote eastern Himalayan kingdom promises weeks of trekking past snow-capped peaks, glacial valleys, pristine forests and mountain lakes, where tourists are few and interaction with the locals are pleasant.\nMs Cathy Low, 69, director of Aveson Travel agency, has been to Bhutan seven times since 2010 and plans to return.\n\"Bhutan has a fantastic energy and atmosphere. The air is clean and clear. There are so many trees and animals and birds growing wild in the mountains. The raw beauty of Bhutan's nature is simply amazing,\" she says.\nVisitors need to walk to see many of the country's main attractions, often high cliff-side Buddhist temples or natural vistas tucked away in alpine valleys, which can take days or weeks to get to.\nTo see the crystal-clear Jimiling Lake and views of Mount Gangkar Puensum, the highest unscaled peak in the world, travellers take the Druk path trek, the most popular trek in Bhutan.\nOver six days, travellers will climb from 2,400m to 4,200m and see some of the country's ancient villages and beautiful scenery, from high ridges to blue pine forests.\nAs for Taktsang Lhakhang (The Tiger's Nest temple), Bhutan's most iconic landmark, it is located on a sheer cliff face 900m above the Paro Valley and is accessible only by a two- to three-hour hike.\nMost trekking takes place in spring and autumn, between March and May and from September to November.\nBut for many, the journey - across mountainsides coloured with Himalayan wildflowers in spring, golden rice fields in autumn and jaw-dropping views of mountains such as Gangkar Puensum, Bhutan tallest peak - is its own reward.\nBhutan famously prioritises happiness over capital gain and tourism opened up here only in 1974.\nEven now, tourism numbers are kept relatively low by high tariffs. Visitors must pay at least US$200 (S$267) a person a night and tours must be organised through a Bhutanese tour operator ( www.tourism.gov.bt/plan/travel-requirements ).\nFortunately, these barriers to the outside world have enabled Bhutan to retain its culture, religion and pristine mountain land.\nPretty blooms in South Africa\nFor a few weeks every spring, after the arrival of the winter rains, the once dry and dusty landscape along South Africa's western coast transforms into a riot of colours.\nCrimson, violet and yellow flowers carpet the fields and mountainsides and people travel from all over the world and drive hundreds of kilometres to see the wilderness in bloom.\nThere are recommended flower routes, maps and dedicated telephone hotlines which will inform enthusiasts about the year's best floral displays along the Western and Northern Capes. The information is also easily accessible online ( tinyurl.com/llr29tn ).\nThe flowers often bloom first in the Namaqualand region near the Namibian border in late July, then progressively southwards to Cape Town by late August. The blooms last until mid- to late September.\nBecause flowers face the sun, which is in the north during a Southern Hemisphere spring, visitors should head as far north as possible, then admire the flowers in the many towns and national parks along their return to Cape Town.\nVisitors will be rewarded with flowers they have never seen or heard of before: meadows of butterfly lilies, lachenalia, sporries, magriets, maartblom, bloedblom and fynbos filling every rocky nook and field to the horizon, as well as African wildlife such as zebra and springbok along the way.\nSome areas, such as the Postberg Flower Reserve, part of the West Coast National Park, are open only during the wildflower season from August to September. For the rest of the year, the reserve, which is about a two-hour drive outside of Cape Town, is disturbed as little as possible so that the fields are full of flowers when spring comes.\nDarling, a little town about an hour's drive from Cape Town, is another floral highlight. Surrounded by wildflowers in Renosterveld Reserve and Tienie Versveld Reserve, 20ha of former farmland that has never been ploughed, the landscape around the town is a rainbow of floral diversity so rich that more than 10 per cent of the Cape Floral Kingdom occurs in less than 1 per cent of Darling's area.\nThis month, the town will celebrate its 100th Darling Wild Flower Show ( www.darlingwildflowers.co.za ), which includes musical performances, a food, arts and crafts fair and, of course, tours of the pristine flower lands, some of which are open only during the flower show.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on September 10, 2017, with the headline 'Nature hot spots'.

            "Destinations\nLocations\nMudeungsan National Park \u00a9 \uc601\ucca0 \uc774 / Flickr\nYou might be surprised to learn that South Korea has a staggering, 22 national parks. Considering the small size of the country, this is quite astonishing. We take a look at the eight most beautiful national parks in South Korea you should absolutely visit.\nDadohaehaesang\nSouth Korea\u2019s largest national park is located in the beautiful province of Jeollanam-do in the southwest of the country. While it is the biggest in terms of size, it\u2019s also only one of four marine and coastal national parks in the country. The three islands of Hongdo, Heuksando, and Baekdo are the main attractions. Visitors are able to spot over 1,500 plant species, over 140 different kinds of birds and over 150 ocean water fish.\nTongyeong \u00a9 Linda Dunsmore\nSeoraksan\nThis national park is one of the most popular in the country due to its beautiful mountain ranges and natural landscape. It is known for its large pine trees and a great variety of oak trees. Seoraksan is extremely popular in the fall due to the picturesque fall foliage.\nBukhansan\nBeing the closest national park to Korea\u2019s capital, Bukhansan is especially popular amongst tourists. While the park features scenic hiking routes, it also has a couple of temples you can stop by along the way. Some of them even offer templestay programs that allow you to spend a few days living among the monks experiencing the modest Buddhist lifestyle.\nThe southernmost national park in South Korea, Hallasan is one of Jeju Island\u2019s most visited attractions. Not only is Hallasan the tallest peak in the country, but it\u2019s also a shield volcano that formed millions of years ago. Visitors can enjoy seven different trails in the park, ranging in distance from 1.5km to over 9km long.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nGyeongju | \u00a9 Linda Dunsmore\nGyeongju is home to the country\u2019s only historical national park. From 57 BC to 935 AD, Gyeongju was the capital city of the Silla Dynasty in Korea. Therefore, you can expect to see some of Korea\u2019s oldest structures in this national park. One of the most impressive sites is the Anapji royal pond garden, as well as the temple of Bulguksa.\nMore Info\nJirisan\nBeing the largest terrestrial national park in the country, there is a lot to see at Jirisan National Park. This national park is one of the best sunrise spots in the country and offers spectacular scenic views during all four seasons. Follow the many paths in the park and you will come across exceptional flora and fauna as well as temples and pagodas.\nSongnisan\nVisiting this national park, visitors start their journey at Beopjusa Temple at the foot of the mountain range. The temple is one of the oldest in South Korea and was constructed in 653. Songnisan is well visited all year round, but it truly comes to life in spring when the brilliant pink azaleas bloom on all sides of the mountain. Moreover, Songnisan is the most central national park in the country making it easy to reach the park from almost anywhere in Korea.\nMudeungsan\nThe main attraction of Mudeungsan National Park are the Jueangjeolli cliffs. These pillar shaped rocks look like they were carved out by hand but in fact they formed about 70 million years ago. While hiking the scenic trails of this national park, you will not only come across a collection of these old stone formations but also a large Buddhist temple surrounded by the pillars making for an incredible photo opportunity.\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nLake Kelimutu | \u00a9 Michael Day/Flickr\nIndonesia is a tropical archipelago graced with more nature than one person could enjoy in a lifetime. The mesmerizing nature and fascinating culture have pushed the country high on the list of coveted places to visit in the world. Among hundreds of charms the country has, here\u2019s our guide to the natural wonders in Indonesia that will take your breath away.\nRaja Ampat\nNatural Feature\nIsland-hopping in Raja Ampat, Papua | \u00a9 nmedia / Shutterstock\nEven in a vast tropical gem with hundreds of mesmerizing spots to enjoy marine natural beauty, Raja Ampat Islands still stands out among the others. Comprising about 1,000 small islands, the archipelago\u2019s landscape itself is a one-of-a-kind feature. The pristine land is inhabited by endemic birds, colorful wild flowers, and other wildlife. Further under the sea, lives at least 500 species of coral and 1,400 of fish, including whale sharks, manta rays, pygmy seahorse, and more, making the location one of the world\u2019s most-prized diving spots.\nMore Info\nMount Bromo\nNatural Feature\nAdd to Plan\nMount Bromo at sunrise, Tengger Semeru National Park in East Java, Indonesia. | \u00a9 Avigator Fortuner 887 / Shutterstock\nMount Bromo is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Indonesia, and if you\u2019ve seen the breathtaking nature, you\u2019ll undoubtedly understand why. The active volcano sits in the middle of a plain called the Sea of Sand (Segara Wedi), along with several other mountains. This active volcano has an iconic blown-off top from recurring eruptions, resulting in a stunning mountain landscape emitting sulfurous smoke, one of the most popular and photographed scenes from Indonesia .\nMore Info\nKelimutu Lake\nThis awe-inspiring volcano lake is best known for its curious case of color-changing water. Comprises three adjacent lakes, each has a color of its own, and those colors are still constantly changing over time. From different shades of green to black, the other to red, brown, and so forth, due to the volcanic activity. During the last century, one of the three lakes changed color 44 times. Each time this happens, locals will bring offerings for their ancestral spirits, making the natural wonder a culturally significant spot as well.\nLabuan Cermin\nCermin means \u201cmirror\u201d, which exactly describes the lake\u2019s natural charm. The crystal clear water makes it possible to observe the lake\u2019s bottom just by glancing down from above; no need for snorkel or equipment of any kind. Tourists can rent a boat to float about in the lagoon (you can even see the boat\u2019s shadow at the bottom of the lake!) or rent a tire float and swim freely around the translucent water that gloriously reflects the sunlight. This lake also has another curious feature. Miraculously, the water near the bottom is salty but near the surface, it\u2019s all freshwater. Swimming below the surface, you can see the habitat changing from freshwater fish to exotic saltwater organisms.\nKomodo Island\nPink beach, Komodo National Park, Indonesia | \u00a9 duchy / Shutterstock\nWidely known as a habitat to the curious and ancient Komodo dragons , this island\u2019s natural beauty matches its wildlife wonder. It has a picturesque landscape of hills, lush vegetations, exotic coastlines, and clear blue ocean, all in one glance. Any point in the island, be it the otherworldly Pink Beach or the hilltop overlooking the ocean and nearby small islands, is a natural wonder like nowhere else in the world.\nMore Info\nCartensz Pyramid\nThis summit will mesmerize anyone partly because of its picturesque rocky mountain charm, and partly because of the unlikeliness and uniqueness it bears as a snowy mountain in a tropical country that has never seen snow elsewhere. As Indonesia\u2019s highest peak that belongs to Mount Jayawijaya in Papua, this top is listed in the seven summits of the world, attracting hikers from around the world. A few hundred meters below the peak is Lake Idenberg, the mysterious lake that drains and fills itself, with occasional appearances of a mystifying black swan.\nKelingking Beach\nHaving been founded in 2003, this stunning beach still has its pristine natural charm. Characterized by the iconic peninsula that appears to hug the beach area below, this spot is as picturesque from above the cliffs as it is below, in the white sand, translucent water area. Tourists can spot manta rays swimming about when the water is shallow and explore the caves around the beach that serve as a home to swallows. Located in Nusa Penida, a small island off the shore of Bali, Kelingking Beach shares the land with other pristine natural wonders.\nDieng Plateau\nNatural Feature\nA historical plateau just above the clouds, Dieng presents tourists with a hypnotizing view of rice fields, villages, and jungle from high above. A culturally significant spot, this highland houses ruins of ancient temples, where beauty is accentuated by the magnificent nature in the backdrop. Beyond its raw natural magnetism, the location is also cherished for the fascinating culture of the local ethnic group, reflected in their customs, artifacts, and festivals.\nMore Info\nCoban Sewu Waterfall\nMeaning \u201ca thousand waterfalls\u201d in the local dialect, this waterfall indeed has countless water flows falling gracefully from the lush cliffs. The clear, rushing water runs through rocks and greenery, decorating the concave hills with a wonderful backdrop of froth. Tourists can observe the natural wonder from above the adjacent hills or descend below to swim in the cool mountain water.\nCoban Sewu, Sidorenggo, Malang, East Java, Indonesia, +62 813 3318 3380\nCoban Sewu waterfall on the border of Malang and Lumajang | \u00a9 Sahabay Ransel/Shutterstock\nMount Rinjani\nMount Rinjani is the second highest volcano in Indonesia, located in an equally beautiful island of Lombok. Around this mountain\u2019s area, natural wonders are in every corner, from twin waterfalls to translucent rivers.

            "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThis article is about the canyon in the southwestern United States. For other Grand Canyons, see Grand Canyon (disambiguation) .\nA steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona, United States\nGrand Canyon\nGrand Canyon\nShow map of the United States\nGrand Canyon\nFloor elevation\nLength\nGeology\nAge\nGeography\nLocation\nThe Grand Canyon ( Hopi : Ongtupqa, [2] Yavapai : Wi:ka\u02bci:la, Navajo : Bid\u00e1\u00e1\u02bc Ha\u02bcazt\u02bci\u02bc Ts\u00e9kooh, [3] [4] Spanish : Gran Ca\u00f1\u00f3n) is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado River in Arizona , United States . The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446\u00a0km) long, up to 18 miles (29\u00a0km) wide and attains a depth of over a mile (6,093 feet or 1,857 meters). [5]\nNearly two billion years of Earth's geological history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut their channels through layer after layer of rock while the Colorado Plateau was uplifted . [6] While some aspects about the history of incision of the canyon are debated by geologists, [7] several recent studies support the hypothesis that the Colorado River established its course through the area about 5 to 6 million years ago. [1] [8] [9] Since that time, the Colorado River has driven the down-cutting of the tributaries and retreat of the cliffs, simultaneously deepening and widening the canyon.\nFor thousands of years, the area has been continuously inhabited by Native Americans , who built settlements within the canyon and its many caves. The Pueblo people considered the Grand Canyon a holy site, and made pilgrimages to it. [10] The first European known to have viewed the Grand Canyon was Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas from Spain, who arrived in 1540. [11]\nContents\nThe Grand Canyon from an airplane, with the Colorado River visible\nGrand Canyon, Arizona, Nevada, Lake Powell to Lake Mead , June 27, 2017, Sentinel-2 true-color satellite image.  Scale 1:450,000.\nThe Grand Canyon is a river valley in the Colorado Plateau that exposes uplifted Proterozoic and Paleozoic strata, and is also one of the six distinct physiographic sections of the Colorado Plateau province. Even though It is not the deepest canyon in the world ( Kali Gandaki Gorge in Nepal is much deeper), the Grand Canyon is known for its visually overwhelming size and its intricate and colorful landscape. Geologically, it is significant because of the thick sequence of ancient rocks that are well preserved and exposed in the walls of the canyon. These rock layers record much of the early geologic history of the North American continent.\nUplift associated with mountain formation later moved these sediments thousands of feet upward and created the Colorado Plateau. The higher elevation has also resulted in greater precipitation in the Colorado River drainage area, but not enough to change the Grand Canyon area from being semi-arid. [12] The uplift of the Colorado Plateau is uneven, and the Kaibab Plateau that the Grand Canyon bisects is over one thousand feet (300\u00a0m) higher at the North Rim than at the South Rim. Almost all runoff from the North Rim (which also gets more rain and snow) flows toward the Grand Canyon, while much of the runoff on the plateau behind the South Rim flows away from the canyon (following the general tilt). The result is deeper and longer tributary washes and canyons on the north side and shorter and steeper side canyons on the south side.\nTemperatures on the North Rim are generally lower than those on the South Rim because of the greater elevation (averaging 8,000 feet or 2,400 metres above sea level). [13] Heavy rains are common on both rims during the summer months. Access to the North Rim via the primary route leading to the canyon ( State Route 67 ) is limited during the winter season due to road closures. [14]\nDiagram showing the placement, age and thickness of the rock units exposed in the Grand Canyon\nRockfalls in recent times, along with other mass wasting , have further widened the canyon\nThe Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin which has developed over the past 70 million years, [15] in part based on apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry showing that Grand Canyon reached a depth near to the modern depth by 20 Ma. [16] A recent study examining caves near Grand Canyon places their origins beginning about 17 million years ago. Previous estimates had placed the age of the canyon at 5\u20136 million years. [17] The study, which was published in the journal Science in 2008, used uranium-lead dating to analyze calcite deposits found on the walls of nine caves throughout the canyon. [18] There is a substantial amount of controversy because this research suggests such a substantial departure from prior widely supported scientific consensus. [19] In December 2012, a study published in the journal Science claimed new tests had suggested the Grand Canyon could be as old as 70 million years. [20] However, this study has been criticized by those who support the \"young canyon\" age of around six million years as \"[an] attempt to push the interpretation of their new data to their limits without consideration of the whole range of other geologic data sets.\" [17]\nThe canyon is the result of erosion which exposes one of the most complete geologic columns on the planet.\nThe major geologic exposures in the Grand Canyon range in age from the 2-billion-year-old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the Inner Gorge to the 230-million-year-old Kaibab Limestone on the Rim. There is a gap of about a billion years between the 500-million-year-old stratum and the level below it, which dates to about 1.5 billion years ago. This large unconformity indicates a long period for which no deposits are present.\nMany of the formations were deposited in warm shallow seas, near-shore environments (such as beaches), and swamps as the seashore repeatedly advanced and retreated over the edge of a proto-North America. Major exceptions include the Permian Coconino Sandstone , which contains abundant geological evidence of aeolian sand dune deposition. Several parts of the Supai Group also were deposited in non\u2013marine environments.\nThe great depth of the Grand Canyon and especially the height of its strata (most of which formed below sea level) can be attributed to 5\u201310 thousand feet (1,500 to 3,000\u00a0m) of uplift of the Colorado Plateau, starting about 65 million years ago (during the Laramide Orogeny ). This uplift has steepened the stream gradient of the Colorado River and its tributaries, which in turn has increased their speed and thus their ability to cut through rock (see the elevation summary of the Colorado River for present conditions).\nWeather conditions during the ice ages also increased the amount of water in the Colorado River drainage system. The ancestral Colorado River responded by cutting its channel faster and deeper.\nThe base level and course of the Colorado River (or its ancestral equivalent) changed 5.3 million years ago when the Gulf of California opened and lowered the river's base level (its lowest point). This increased the rate of erosion and cut nearly all of the Grand Canyon's current depth by 1.2 million years ago. The terraced walls of the canyon were created by differential erosion . [21]\nBetween 100,000 and 3 million years ago, volcanic activity deposited ash and lava over the area which at times completely obstructed the river. These volcanic rocks are the youngest in the canyon.\nEagle Rock (located at Eagle Point) on the West Rim, named for its shape, is considered sacred by the Hualapai Indians.\nThe Ancestral Puebloans were a Native American culture centered on the present-day Four Corners area of the United States. They were the first people known to live in the Grand Canyon area. The cultural group has often been referred to in archaeology as the Anasazi, although the term is not preferred by the modern Puebloan peoples .[ citation needed ] The word \"Anasazi\" is Navajo for \"Ancient Ones\" or \"Ancient Enemy\". [22] [ unreliable source? ]\nArchaeologists still debate when this distinct culture emerged. The current consensus, based on terminology defined by the Pecos Classification , suggests their emergence was around 1200 BCE during the Basketmaker II Era . Beginning with the earliest explorations and excavations, researchers have believed that the Ancestral Puebloans are ancestors of the modern Pueblo peoples . [22]\nIn addition to the Ancestral Puebloans, a number of distinct cultures have inhabited the Grand Canyon area. The Cohonina lived to the west of the Grand Canyon, between 500 and 1200 CE. [23] [24] The Cohonina were ancestors of the Yuman , Havasupai , and Hualapai peoples who inhabit the area today. [25]\nThe Sinagua were a cultural group occupying an area to the southeast of the Grand Canyon, between the Little Colorado River and the Salt River , between approximately 500 and 1425 CE. The Sinagua may have been ancestors of several Hopi clans.\nBy the time of the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century, newer cultures had evolved. The Hualapai inhabit a 100-mile (160\u00a0km) stretch along the pine-clad southern side of the Grand Canyon. The Havasupai have been living in the area near Cataract Canyon since the beginning of the 13th century, occupying an area the size of Delaware . [26] The Southern Paiutes live in what is now southern Utah and northern Arizona. The Navajo , or Din\u00e9, live in a wide area stretching from the San Francisco Peaks eastwards towards the Four Corners. Archaeological and linguistic evidence suggests the Navajo descended from the Athabaskan people near Great Slave Lake , Canada, who migrated after the 11th century. [27]\nEuropean arrival and settlement[ edit ]\nIn September 1540, under orders from the conquistador Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado to search for the fabled Seven Cities of Cibola , Captain Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas , along with Hopi guides and a small group of Spanish soldiers, traveled to the south rim of the Grand Canyon between Desert View and Moran Point. Pablo de Melgrossa, Juan Galeras, and a third soldier descended some one third of the way into the canyon until they were forced to return because of lack of water. In their report, they noted that some of the rocks in the canyon were \"bigger than the great tower of Seville, Giralda \" [28] It is speculated that their Hopi guides likely knew routes to the canyon floor, but may have been reluctant to lead the Spanish to the river. No Europeans visited the canyon again for more than two hundred years.\nFathers Francisco Atanasio Dom\u00ednguez and Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante were two Spanish priests who, with a group of Spanish soldiers, explored southern Utah and traveled along the north rim of the canyon in Glen and Marble Canyons in search of a route from Santa Fe to California in 1776. They eventually found a crossing, formerly known as the \"Crossing of the Fathers,\" that today lies under Lake Powell .\nAlso in 1776, Fray Francisco Garces, a Franciscan missionary, spent a week near Havasupai, unsuccessfully attempting to convert a band of Native Americans to Christianity. He described the canyon as \"profound\". [28]\nJames Ohio Pattie, along with a group of American trappers and mountain men, may have been the next European to reach the canyon, in 1826. [29]\nJacob Hamblin , a Mormon missionary, was sent by Brigham Young in the 1850s to locate suitable river crossing sites in the canyon. Building good relations with local Hualapai and white settlers, he found the Crossing of the Fathers, and the locations that would become Lees Ferry in 1858 and Pearce Ferry (later operated by, and named for, Harrison Pearce )\u00a0\u2013 only the latter two sites suitable for ferry operation.[ citation needed ] He also acted as an advisor to John Wesley Powell , before his second expedition to the Grand Canyon, serving as a diplomat between Powell and the local native tribes to ensure the safety of his party.\nWilliam Bell 's photograph of the Grand Canyon, taken in 1872 as part of the Wheeler expedition\nIn 1857, Edward Fitzgerald Beale was superintendent of an expedition to survey a wagon road along the 35th parallel from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River. He led a small party of men in search of water on the Coconino Plateau near the canyon's south rim. On September 19, near present-day National Canyon, they came upon what May Humphreys Stacey described in his journal as \"...a wonderful canyon four thousand feet deep. Everyone (in the party) admitted that he never before saw anything to match or equal this astonishing natural curiosity.\"\nAlso in 1857, the U.S. War Department asked Lieutenant Joseph Ives to lead an expedition to assess the feasibility of an up-river navigation from the Gulf of California. Also in a stern wheeler steamboat Explorer , after two months and 350 miles (560\u00a0km) of difficult navigation, his party reached Black Canyon some two months after George Johnson.[ citation needed ] The Explorer struck a rock and was abandoned. Ives led his party east into the canyon\u00a0\u2014 they may have been the first Europeans to travel the Diamond Creek drainage and traveled eastwards along the south rim. In his \"Colorado River of the West\" report to the Senate in 1861 he states that \"One or two trappers profess to have seen the canyon.\"\nNoon rest in Marble Canyon , second Powell Expedition, 1872\nAccording to the San Francisco Herald, in a series of articles run in 1853, Captain Joseph R. Walker in January 1851 with his nephew James T. Walker and six men, traveled up the Colorado River to a point where it joined the Virgin River and continued east into Arizona, traveling along the Grand Canyon and making short exploratory side trips along the way. Walker is reported to have said he wanted to visit the \"Moqui\" Indians, as the Hopi were then called by Europeans. He had met these people briefly in previous years, thought them exceptionally interesting and wanted to become better acquainted. The Herald reporter then stated, \"We believe that Captain Joe Walker is the only white man in this country that has ever visited this strange people.\"[ citation needed ]\nIn 1858, John Strong Newberry became probably the first geologist to visit the Grand Canyon. [30]\nIn 1869, Major John Wesley Powell led the first expedition down the canyon. Powell set out to explore the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. Powell ordered a shipwright to build four reinforced Whitewall rowboats from Chicago and had them shipped east on the newly completed Continental railroad. He hired nine men, including his brother Walter, and collected provisions for ten months. They set out from Green River, Wyoming on May 24. Passing through (or portaging around) a series of dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River, near present-day Moab, Utah . Most of their food spoiled after getting wet in the waves or by heavy rains. Beaten up by ferocious whitewater and nearly out of food, three men left the expedition in the Grand Canyon, electing to walk 75 miles (121\u00a0km) out across a desert to a Mormon settlement. Never seen again, their disappearance remains one of the most enduring mysteries of American western history. The remaining members completed the journey through the Grand Canyon on August 13, 1869. [31] [32] In 1871 Powell first used the term \"Grand Canyon\"; previously it had been called the \"Big Canyon\". [33]\nIn 1889, Frank M. Brown wanted to build a railroad along the Colorado River to carry coal. He, his chief engineer Robert Brewster Stanton , and 14 others started to explore the Grand Canyon in poorly designed cedar wood boats, with no life preservers. Brown drowned in an accident near Marble Canyon : Stanton made new boats and proceeded to explore the Colorado all of the way to the Gulf of California . [34]\nThe Grand Canyon [35] became an official national monument in 1908 and a national park in 1919.\nSettlers in and near the canyon[ edit ]\nFederal protection: National Monument and Park[ edit ]\nU.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Grand Canyon in 1903.  An avid outdoorsman and staunch conservationist, Roosevelt established the Grand Canyon Game Preserve on November 28, 1906. Livestock grazing was reduced, but predators such as mountain lions, eagles, and wolves were eradicated. Roosevelt along with other members of his conservation group, the Boone and Crockett Club helped form the National Parks Association , which in turn lobbied for the Antiquities Act of 1906 which gave Roosevelt the power to create national monuments. Once the act was passed, Roosevelt immediately added adjacent national forest lands and redesignated the preserve a U.S. National Monument on January 11, 1908. [36] Opponents such as land and mining claim holders blocked efforts to reclassify the monument as a U.S. National Park for 11 years. Grand Canyon National Park was finally established as the 17th U.S. National Park by an Act of Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on February 26, 1919. [23]\nThe federal government administrators who manage park resources face many challenges. These include issues related to the recent reintroduction into the wild of the highly endangered California condor , air tour overflight noise levels, water rights disputes with various tribal reservations that border the park, and forest fire management. Federal officials started floods in the Grand Canyon in hopes of restoring its ecosystem in 1996, 2004 and 2008. The canyon's ecosystem was permanently changed after the construction of the Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. [37]\nBetween 2003 and 2011, 2,215 mining claims had been requested that are adjacent to the canyon, including claims for uranium mines. Mining has been suspended since 2009, when U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar withdrew 1\u00a0million acres (4,000\u00a0km2) from the permitting process, pending assessment of the environmental impact of mining. Critics of the mines are concerned that, once mined, the uranium will leach into the water of the Colorado River and contaminate the water supply for up to 18 million people. [38] Salazar's so-called \"Northern Arizona Withdrawal\" is a 20-year moratorium on new mines, but allows existing mines to continue. In 2012, the federal government stopped new mines in the area, which was upheld by the U.S. District Court for Arizona in 2014, but appealed by the National Mining Association , joined by the state of Arizona under Attorney General Mark Brnovich as well as Utah, Montana and Nevada. National Mining Association v. Jewell is pending before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as of September 2015. [39]\nSouth Rim buildings[ edit ]\nThere are several historic buildings located along the South Rim with most in the vicinity of Grand Canyon Village .\nBuckey O'Neill Cabin was built during the 1890s by William Owen \"Buckey\" O'Neill . He built the cabin because of a copper deposit that was nearby. He had several occupations such as miner, judge, politician, author and tour guide. This cabin is the longest continually standing structure on the South Rim. It is currently used as a guest house; booking is required well in advance.\nKolb Studio was built in 1904 by brothers Ellsworth and Emery Kolb. They were photographers who made a living by photographing visitors walking down the Bright Angel Trail . In 1911, the Kolb brothers filmed their journey down the Green and Colorado Rivers . Emery Kolb showed this movie regularly in his studio until 1976, when he died at the age of 95. Today the building serves as an art gallery and exhibit.\nThe El Tovar Hotel was built in 1905 and is the most luxurious lodging on the South Rim. The hotel consists of 4 stories with a rustic chalet appearance called \"National Park Rustic.\" It was designed by Charles Whittlesley. A gift shop and restaurant are located inside the hotel.\nHopi House was built by Mary Jane Colter in 1905. It is based on structures that were built in an ancient Hopi settlement called Old Oraibi , located on the Third Mesa in eastern Arizona. It served as a residence for the Hopi Indians who sold arts and crafts to South Rim visitors.\nVerkamp's Curios, which stands next to the Hopi House, was built by John Verkamp in 1905. He sold arts and crafts as well as souvenirs. Until September 2008, it was run by his descendants; in November 2008, the building reopened as a visitor center focusing on the history of the Grand Canyon Village community.\nGrand Canyon Railway Depot was completed in 1910 and contains 2 levels. Gordon Chappell, Regional Historian for the Park Service, claims that this depot building is one of only three log-cabin-style train stations currently standing, out of fourteen ever built in the U.S. [40] The depot is the northern terminus of the Grand Canyon Railway which begins in Williams, Arizona .\nLookout Studio , another Mary Colter design, was built in 1914. Photography, artwork, books, souvenirs, and rock and fossil specimens are sold here. A great view of Bright Angel Trail can be seen here.\nDesert View Watchtower , one of Mary Colter's best-known works, was built in 1932. Situated at the far eastern end of the South Rim, 27 miles (43\u00a0km) from Grand Canyon Village, the tower stands 70 feet (21\u00a0m) tall. The top of the tower is 7,522 feet (2,293\u00a0m) above sea level, the highest point on the South Rim. It offers one of the few full views of the bottom of the canyon and the Colorado River. It was designed to mimic Ancestral Puebloans watchtowers, though, with four levels, it is significantly taller than historical towers. [41]\nBright Angel Lodge was built of logs and stone in 1935. Mary Colter designed the lodge and it was built by the Fred Harvey Company . Inside the lodge is a small museum honoring Fred Harvey (June 27, 1835 \u2013 February 9, 1901), who played a major role in popularizing the Grand Canyon. In the History Room is a stone fireplace layered in the same sequence as those in the canyon.\nA storm over the Grand Canyon\nWeather in the Grand Canyon varies according to elevation. The forested rims are high enough to receive winter snowfall, but along the Colorado River in the Inner Gorge, temperatures are similar to those found in Tucson and other low elevation desert locations in Arizona. Conditions in the Grand Canyon region are generally dry, but substantial precipitation occurs twice annually, during seasonal pattern shifts in winter (when Pacific storms usually deliver widespread, moderate rain and high-elevation snow to the region from the west) and in late summer (due to the North American Monsoon , which delivers waves of moisture from the southeast, causing dramatic, localized thunderstorms fueled by the heat of the day). [42] Average annual precipitation on the South Rim is less than 16 inches (41\u00a0cm), with 60 inches (150\u00a0cm) of snow; the higher North Rim usually receives 27 inches (69\u00a0cm) of moisture, with a typical snowfall of 144 inches (370\u00a0cm); and Phantom Ranch, far below the canyon's rims along the Colorado River at 2,500 feet (762\u00a0m) gets just 8 inches (20\u00a0cm) of rain, and snow is a rarity.\nGrand Canyon covered with snow\nTemperatures vary wildly throughout the year, with summer highs within the Inner Gorge commonly exceeding 100\u00a0\u00b0F (37.8\u00a0\u00b0C) and winter minimum temperatures sometimes falling below zero degrees Fahrenheit (\u221217.8\u00a0\u00b0C) along the canyon's rims. [42] Visitors are often surprised by these potentially extreme conditions, and this, along with the high altitude of the canyon's rims, can lead to unpleasant side effects such as dehydration , sunburn , and hypothermia .\nWeather conditions can greatly affect hiking and canyon exploration, and visitors should obtain accurate forecasts because of hazards posed by exposure to extreme temperatures, winter storms and late summer monsoons. While the park service posts weather information at gates and visitor centers, this is a rough approximation only, and should not be relied upon for trip planning. For accurate weather in the canyon, hikers should consult the National Weather Service 's NOAA weather radio or the official National Weather Service website. [43]\nThe National Weather Service has had a cooperative station on the South Rim since 1903. The record high temperature on the South Rim was 105\u00a0\u00b0F (41\u00a0\u00b0C) on June 26, 1974, and the record low temperature was \u221220\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 1, 1919, February 1, 1985, and December 23, 1990. [44] [45] [46]\nSmoke from prescribed fires on the South Rim, as seen from Yavapai Point, April 2007. [47]\nThe Grand Canyon area has some of the cleanest air in the United States. [48] :p.5-2 [49] However, at times the air quality can be considerably affected by events such as forest fires and dust storms in the Southwest .\nWhat effect there is on air quality and visibility in the canyon has been mainly from sulfates, soils, and organics. The sulfates largely result from urban emissions in southern California, borne on the prevailing westerly winds throughout much of the year, and emissions from Arizona's copper smelter region, borne on southerly or southeasterly winds during the monsoon . Airborne soils originate with windy conditions and road dust . Organic particles result from vehicle emissions, long-range transport from urban areas, and forest fires, as well as from VOCs emitted by vegetation in the surrounding forests. Nitrates, carried in from urban areas, stationary sources, and vehicle emissions; as well as black carbon from forest fires and vehicle emissions, also contribute to a lesser extent. [49] [50] :p.26, 49\u201351\nA number of actions have been taken to preserve and further improve air quality and visibility at the canyon.\nIn 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act established the Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission (GCVTC) to advise the US EPA on strategies for protecting visual air quality on the Colorado Plateau . The GCVTC released its final report in 1996 and initiated the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP), a partnership of state, tribal and federal agencies to help coordinate implementation of the Commission's recommendations. [51] [52]\nIn 1999, the Regional Haze Rule established a goal of restoring visibility in national parks and wilderness areas (Class 1 areas), such as the Grand Canyon, to natural background levels by 2064. Subsequent revisions to the rule provide specific requirements for making reasonable progress toward that goal. [53]\nNatural fog sometimes fills the canyon, during temperature inversions\nIn the early 1990s, studies indicated that emissions of SO2, a sulfate precursor, from the Navajo Generating Station affected visibility in the canyon mainly in the winter, and which if controlled would improve wintertime visibility by 2 to 7%. [54] :p.C-2,C-6 As a result, scrubbers were added to the plant's three units in 1997 through 1999, reducing SO2 emissions by more than 90%. The plant also installed low-NOx SOFA burners in 2009 -2011, reducing emissions of NOx, a nitrate precursor, by 40%.\nEmissions from the Mohave Generating Station to the west were similarly found to affect visibility in the canyon. The plant was required to have installed SO2 scrubbers, but was instead shut down in 2005, completely eliminating its emissions. [55]\nPrescribed fires are typically conducted in the spring and fall in the forests adjacent to the canyon to reduce the potential for severe forest fires and resulting smoke conditions. Although prescribed fires also affect air quality, the controlled conditions allow the use of management techniques to minimize their impact. [56] [57] :p.86,93\nBiology and ecology[ edit ]\nThere are approximately 1,737 known species of vascular plants , 167 species of fungi , 64 species of moss and 195 species of lichen found in Grand Canyon National Park. [58] This variety is largely due to the 8,000 foot (2,400\u00a0m) elevation change from the Colorado River up to the highest point on the North Rim. [58] Grand Canyon boasts a dozen endemic plants (known only within the Park's boundaries) while only ten percent of the Park's flora is exotic. [58] Sixty-three plants found here have been given special status by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . [58]\nGrand Canyon Clouds time lapse VP8\nThe Mojave Desert influences the western sections of the canyon, Sonoran Desert vegetation covers the eastern sections, and ponderosa and pinyon pine forests grow on both rims. [59]\nNatural seeps and springs percolating out of the canyon walls are home to 11% of all the plant species found in the Grand Canyon. [59] The canyon itself can act as a connection between the east and the west by providing corridors of appropriate habitat along its length. [59] The canyon can also be a genetic barrier to some species, like the tassel-eared squirrel . [59]\nThe aspect, or direction a slope faces, also plays a major role in adding diversity to the Grand Canyon. North-facing slopes receive about one-third the normal amount of sunlight, so plants growing there are similar to plants found at higher elevations, or in more northern latitudes. [59] The south-facing slopes receive the full amount of sunlight and are covered in vegetation typical of the Sonoran Desert. [59]\nOf the 90 mammal species found along the Colorado River corridor, 18 are rodents and 22 are bats. [60]\nLife zones and communities[ edit ]\nThe Park contains several major ecosystems. [13] Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America. [13] The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian. [13] This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada. Differences in elevation and the resulting variations in climate are the major factors that form the various life zones and communities in and around the canyon. Grand Canyon National Park contains 129 vegetation communities, and the composition and distribution of plant species is influenced by climate, geomorphology and geology. [58]\nThe Lower Sonoran life zone spans from the Colorado River up to 3,500 feet (1,100\u00a0m). Along the Colorado River and its perennial tributaries, a riparian community exists. [58] Coyote willow , arrowweed , seep-willow , western honey mesquite , catclaw acacia , and exotic tamarisk (saltcedar) are the predominant species. [58] Hanging gardens, seeps and springs often contain rare plants such as the white-flowering western redbud , stream orchid , and Flaveria mcdougallii . [58] Endangered fish in the river include the humpback chub and the razorback sucker . [61]\nA bighorn ewe at the Grand Canyon, 2008\nThe three most common amphibians in these riparian communities are the canyon tree frog , red-spotted toad , and Woodhouse's Rocky Mountain toad . [62] Leopard frogs are very rare in the Colorado River corridor, they have undergone major declines and have not been seen in the Canyon in several years. [62] There are 33 crustacean species found in the Colorado River and its tributaries within Grand Canyon National Park. Of these 33, 16 are considered true zooplankton organisms. [63]\nOnly 48 bird species regularly nest along the river, while others use the river as a migration corridor or as overwintering habitat. The bald eagle is one species that uses the river corridor as winter habitat. [64]\nRiver otters may have disappeared from the park in the late 20th century, and muskrats are extremely rare. [60] Beavers cut willows, cottonwoods, and shrubs for food, and can significantly affect the riparian vegetation. [60] Other rodents, such as antelope squirrels and pocket mice , are mostly omnivorous, using many different vegetation types. [60] Grand Canyon bats typically roost in desert uplands, but forage on the abundance of insects along the river and its tributaries. [60] In addition to bats, coyotes , ringtails , and spotted skunks are the most numerous riparian predators and prey on invertebrates, rodents, and reptiles. [60]\nRaccoons , weasels , bobcats , gray foxes , and mountain lions are also present, but are much more rare. [60] Mule deer and desert bighorn sheep are the ungulates that frequent the river corridor. Since the removal of 500 feral burros in the early 1980s, bighorn sheep numbers have rebounded. [60] Mule deer are generally not permanent residents along the river, but travel down from the rim when food and water resources there become scarce. [60]\nEleven aquatic and 26 terrestrial species of mollusks have been identified in and around Grand Canyon National Park. [66] Of the aquatic species, two are bivalves (clams) and nine are gastropods (snails). [66] Twenty-six species of terrestrial gastropods have been identified, primarily land snails and slugs. [66]\nThere are approximately 41 reptile species in Grand Canyon National Park. Ten are considered common along the river corridor and include lizards and snakes. [67] Lizard density tends to be highest along the stretch of land between the water's edge and the beginning of the upland desert community. [67] The two largest lizards in the canyon are gila monsters and chuckwallas . [67] Many snake species, which are not directly dependent on surface water, may be found both within the inner gorge and the Colorado River corridor. Six rattlesnake species have been recorded in the park. [67]\nAbove the river corridor a desert scrub community, composed of North American desert flora, thrives. Typical warm desert species such as creosote bush , white bursage , brittlebush , catclaw acacia, ocotillo , mariola , western honey mesquite, four-wing saltbush , big sagebrush , blackbrush and rubber rabbitbrush grow in this community. [58] The mammalian fauna in the woodland scrub community consists of 50 species, mostly rodents and bats. [60] Three of the five Park woodrat species live in the desert scrub community. [60]\nExcept for the western (desert) banded gecko , which seems to be distributed only near water along the Colorado River, all of the reptiles found near the river also appear in the uplands, but in lower densities. [67] The desert gopher tortoise , a threatened species, inhabits the desert scrublands in the western end of the park. [67]\nUpper Sonoran and Transition[ edit ]\nA California condor in flight, photographed from Navajo Bridge at Marble Canyon , 2008. Wild condors are numbered to aid wildlife researchers. As of April 2009, there were 172 wild California condors known.\nThe Upper Sonoran Life Zone includes most of the inner canyon and South Rim at elevations from 3,500 to 7,000 feet (1,100 to 2,100\u00a0m). [59] This zone is generally dominated by blackbrush , sagebrush , and pinyon-juniper woodlands. Elevations of 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200\u00a0m) are in the Mojave Desert Scrub community of the Upper Sonoran. This community is dominated by the four-winged saltbush and creosote bush; other important plants include Utah agave , narrowleaf mesquite , ratany , catclaw acacia , and various cacti species. [59]\nApproximately 30 bird species breed primarily in the desert uplands and cliffs of the inner canyon. [64] Virtually all bird species present breed in other suitable habitats throughout the Sonoran and Mohave deserts. [64] The abundance of bats, swifts, and riparian birds provides ample food for peregrines , and suitable eyrie sites are plentiful along the steep canyon walls. Also, several critically endangered California condors that were re-introduced to the Colorado Plateau on the Arizona Strip, have made the eastern part of the Park their home. [64]\nRed-tailed Hawk flying at the south rim of Grand Canyon\nAn elk searching for water at Grand Canyon National Park in 2018.\nThe conifer forests provide habitat for 52 mammal species. [60] Porcupines , shrews , red squirrels , tassel eared Kaibab and Abert's squirrels , black bear , mule deer, and elk are found at the park's higher elevations on the Kaibab Plateau. [60]\nAbove the desert scrub and up to 6,200 feet (1,900\u00a0m) is a pinyon pine forest and one seed juniper woodland. [58] Within this woodland one can find big sagebrush , snakeweed , Mormon tea , Utah agave, banana and narrowleaf Yucca , winterfat , Indian ricegrass , dropseed , and needlegrass . [58] There are a variety of snakes and lizards here, but one species of reptile, the mountain short-horned lizard, is a particularly abundant inhabitant of the pi\u00f1on-juniper and ponderosa pine forests. [67]\nPonderosa pine forests grow at elevations between 6,500 and 8,200 feet (2,000 and 2,500\u00a0m), on both North and South rims in the Transition life zone. [58] The South Rim includes species such as gray fox , mule deer , bighorn sheep , rock squirrels , pinyon pine and Utah juniper . [59] Additional species such as Gambel oak , New Mexico locust , mountain mahogany , elderberry , creeping mahonia , and fescue have been identified in these forests. [58] The Utah tiger salamander and the Great Basin spadefoot toad are two amphibians that are common in the rim forests. [62] Of the approximately 90 bird species that breed in the coniferous forests, 51 are summer residents and at least 15 of these are known to be neotropical migrants. [64]\nCanadian and Hudsonian[ edit ]\nMontane meadows and subalpine grassland communities of the Hudsonian life zone are rare and located only on the North Rim. [58] Both are typified by many grass species. Some of these grasses include blue and black grama , big galleta , Indian ricegrass and three-awns . [58] The wettest areas support sedges and forbs. [58]\nView from the South Rim\nGrand Canyon tourism[ edit ]\nGrand Canyon National Park is one of the world's premier natural attractions, attracting about five million visitors per year. Overall, 83% were from the United States: California (12%), Arizona (9%), Texas (5%), Florida (3%) and New York (3%) represented the top domestic visitors. Seventeen percent of visitors were from outside the United States; the most prominently represented nations were the United Kingdom (4%), Canada (4%), Japan (2%), Germany (2%) and The Netherlands (1%). [68] The South Rim is open all year round weather permitting.  The North Rim is generally open mid-May to mid-October. [69]\nRafters in the Grand Canyon pass one of the rapids of the (mud-)\"colored\" Colorado River\nAside from casual sightseeing from the South Rim (averaging 7,000 feet [2,100\u00a0m] above sea level), rafting, hiking, running, and helicopter tours are popular. The Grand Canyon Ultra Marathon is a 78-mile (126\u00a0km) race over 24 hours. The floor of the valley is accessible by foot, muleback, or by boat or raft from upriver. Hiking down to the river and back up to the rim in one day is discouraged by park officials because of the distance, steep and rocky trails, change in elevation, and danger of heat exhaustion from the much higher temperatures at the bottom. Rescues are required annually of unsuccessful rim-to-river-to-rim travelers. Nevertheless, hundreds of fit and experienced hikers complete the trip every year.[ citation needed ]\nCamping on the North and South rims is generally restricted to established campgrounds and reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. There is at large camping available along many parts of the North Rim managed by Kaibab National Forest . North Rim campsites are only open seasonally due to road closures from weather and winter snowpack. All overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Backcountry Office (BCO). [70] Each year Grand Canyon National Park receives approximately 30,000 requests for backcountry permits. The park issues 13,000 permits, and close to 40,000 people camp overnight. [70] The earliest a permit application is accepted is the first of the month, four months before the proposed start month.\nA 6-minute video of a flight over the Grand Canyon ( view in high quality )\nTourists wishing for a more vertical perspective can go skydiving, board helicopters and small airplanes in Boulder, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (seven miles from the South Rim) for canyon flyovers. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly within 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) of the rim within the national park because of a late 1990s crash. [71] The last aerial video footage from below the rim was filmed in 1984. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).\nIn 2007, the Hualapai Tribe opened the glass-bottomed Grand Canyon Skywalk on their property, Grand Canyon West. The Skywalk is about 250 miles (400\u00a0km) by road from Grand Canyon Village at the South Rim. [72] The skywalk has attracted \"thousands of visitors a year, most from Las Vegas\". [73]\nIn 2016, skydiving at the Grand Canyon become possible with the first Grand Canyon Skydiving operation opening up at the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, on the South Rim.\nIn 2014, a developer announced plans to build a multimedia complex on the canyon's rim called the Grand Canyon Escalade . On 420 acres (170\u00a0ha) there would be shops, an IMAX theater, hotels and an RV park. A gondola would enable easy visits to the canyon floor where a \"riverwalk\" of \"connected walkways, an eatery, a tramway station, a seating area and a wastewater package plant\" would be situated. Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly has indicated agreement; the tribe would have to invest $65 million for road, water and communication facilities for the $1 billion complex. One of the developers is Navajo and has cited an 8 to 18 percent share of the gross revenue for the tribe as an incentive. [74]\nViewing the canyon[ edit ]\nGuano Point \u2013 a popular vantage point for tourists, situated on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon, Hualapai Indian Reservation\nLipan Point is a promontory located on the South Rim. This point is located to the east of the Grand Canyon Village along the Desert View Drive. There is a parking lot for visitors who care to drive along with the canyon's bus service that routinely stops at the point. The trailhead to the Tanner Trail is located just before the parking lot. The view from Lipan Point shows a wide array of rock strata and the Unkar Creek area in the inner canyon.\nGrand Canyon fatalities[ edit ]\nMid-1800s to 2015[ edit ]\nGrand Canyon rescue helicopter, 1978\nAbout 770 deaths have occurred between the mid 1800s and 2015. [75] [76] Of the fatalities that occurred from 1869 to 2001, some were as follows: 53 resulted from falls; 65 were attributable to environmental causes, including heat stroke, cardiac arrest, dehydration, and hypothermia; 7 were caught in flash floods; 79 were drowned in the Colorado River; 242 perished in airplane and helicopter crashes (128 of them in the 1956 disaster mentioned below); 25 died in freak errors and accidents, including lightning strikes and rock falls; and 23 were the victims of homicides. [77]\n1956 air disaster[ edit ]\nIn 1956, the Grand Canyon was the site of the deadliest commercial aviation disaster in history at the time.\nOn the morning of June 30, 1956, a TWA Lockheed Super Constellation and a United Airlines Douglas DC-7 departed Los Angeles International Airport within three minutes of one another on eastbound transcontinental flights. Approximately 90 minutes later, the two propeller-driven airliners collided above the canyon while both were flying in unmonitored airspace.\nThe wreckage of both planes fell into the eastern portion of the canyon, on Temple and Chuar Buttes, near the confluence of the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers. The disaster killed all 128 passengers and crew members aboard both planes.\nThis accident led to the institution of high-altitude airways and direct radar observation of aircraft (known as positive control ) by en route ground controllers.\nSouth Kaibab Trail at Cedar Ridge\nOver the Edge[ edit ]\nIn Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon, Thomas M.

            "Destinations\nLocations\nMount Agung in Bali seen from Mount Rinjani in Lombok | \u00a9 Rosino/Flickr\nLocated in the most active seismic region on the planet called the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesian volcanoes aren\u2019t only the most exquisite, they are also the most dynamic and busy. For adventurous tourists, these are the most stunning volcanoes in Indonesia that deserve a visit.\nGunung Rinjani\nGunung (Mount) Rinjani is the second highest volcano in Indonesia, located in the beautiful island paradise Lombok. The beautiful nature that surrounds the mountain has inspired local and international tourists to visit even for just a short hike around the mountain\u2019s hills. However, an unparalleled beauty awaits those who are determined to reach the summit. The mountain has an exquisite crater lake called Segara Anak on its summit, with stunning blue water and lush greeneries on the surrounding hills.\nGunung Ijen\nNatural Feature\nAdd to Plan\nBlue fire of Mount Ijen in 23 May 2016, Kawah ijen, Java, Indonesia. | \u00a9 MTS_Photo / Shutterstock\nA hike through Mount Ijen will not only reward visitors with a breathtaking nature view and cool breeze but also with rare blue sulfur flames blazing at its caldera. Local and international tourists have hiked this mountain for a sight of the otherworldly phenomenon and were not disappointed. Visitors can also bring back souvenirs sold by miners on the mountain, adorable statues carved from sulfur.\nMore Info\nGunung Agung\nGunung Agung is the highest point on the island paradise of Bali . Cherished for more than its natural beauty, this mountain is considered a sacred site by Balinese; their very own Olympus where the deities set their throne. This mountain\u2019s spirit is honored in Balinese temples, and the mountain itself is home to the island\u2019s largest temple or \u2018Mother Temple\u2019, Besakih. Due to its challenging landscape and sacredness, hiring a local guide is mandatory when hiking this mountain.\nGunung Bromo\nMount Bromo is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Indonesia. It is located on a dense caldera in the middle of a \u201cSea of Sand\u201d plain, offering a stunning view of various mountainous structures in one frame. Bromo is also preferred because reaching the summit could be effortless \u2014tourists can rent a jeep to a sand area near the mountain, continue with a horse-ride, then a climb through the stairs to the crater.\nGunung Merbabu\nMerbabu is one of the most popular hikes in Java at 3,142-meters, high enough to tower over other mountains visible in the surrounding area. A hike to the summit will presents visitors with beautiful savannah, hills, lush vegetation and a view of other mountains in the background. The mountain has five stunning calderas and a vast edelweiss field near the summit.\nGunung Batur\nOne of the most popular spots for sunrise in Bali, the hiking trails for this mountain are often packed with tourists. Despite being 1,717-meters high, a hike to the summit can be completed in less than three hours. Located in one of the biggest calderas in the world, Mount Batur owes its natural beauty to its surrounding sister peaks. Aside from the cool crisp mountain air and stunning \u2018double caldera\u2019, visitors will also be greeted with the majestic view of Mount Abang in the background.\nAdd to Plan\nMount Gunung semeru, Tengger Semeru National Park in East Java, Indonesia. | \u00a9 People Image Studio / Shutterstock\nSemeru is the highest peak in Java and the third-highest in Indonesia, placing it favorably on the list of stunning volcanoes to conquer in Indonesia. Its natural features do not disappoint, with vast savannah, stunning slopes, gorgeous freshwater lake, and a Brazilian verbena field before the summit. Hiking this mountain can be dangerous depending on the volcanic activity, so it\u2019s best to check the status before embarking on the journey.\nMore Info\nGunung Merapi\nMeaning \u201cthe mountain of fire\u201d in local dialect, Merapi is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia. The latest large eruption was in 2010, killing more than 200 people including the mountain\u2019s elder gatekeeper, Mbah Maridjan. The mountain has been relatively quiet ever since, making it possible to hike up to the crater rim. Visitors can also explore the ruins of civilization that were once alive around the volcano before the last eruption. Some parts of the mountain are now a popular geo-tourism destination also serving as a conservation and educational site.\nMount Kerinci viewed from Pelompek, Sumatra, Indonesia. | \u00a9 Shannon Granger / Alamy Stock Photo\nMount Kerinci is the highest volcano peak in Indonesia , located in the island of Sumatra. At the summit, visitors can enjoy an unrestricted view to its surrounding cities, even the Indian Ocean. It has a large crater with brilliant green water, located near a clear swamp lake called Bento. But perhaps the most anticipated charm of this mountain is the thriving wildlife. Mount Kerinci is the natural habitat of the protected Sumatran tiger and rhinoceros, as well as other birds and wild species.\nMore Info\nGunung Tambora\nLocated in West Nusa Tenggara, this volcano is responsible for the largest volcanic explosion ever recorded in history in 1815, killing at least 71,000 people with an eruption that could be heard over 2,000 kilometers away and causing a \u201cYear without Summer\u201d around the world, the following year. The tragedy left an impressive natural relic, an enormous crater as wide as seven kilometers. Since the big explosion, Tambora is now relatively calm and safe to hike.\n"

            "If you\u2019re looking to reconnect with nature and see something truly amazing, there are plenty of awe-inspiring sights you\u2019ll be putting straight on your bucket list. From ice-blue pools in Hokkaido to the turquoise seas of Okinawa , with ancient forests and sand dunes in between, Japan holds myriad natural wonders. Although some may be more of a struggle to reach than others, they are all incredible displays of the power of nature that you\u2019ll never forget.\nThe sweeping sand dunes, Tottori\nA strange sight in Japan is Tottori\u2019s vista of desert-like sand dunes stretching to the sea. But these are no mirage: they\u2019re the result of 100,000 years of ocean winds blowing in from the Sea of Japan. In the east corner of Tottori Prefecture, the dunes stretch over 16 kilometers in length and are 2 kilometers wide, with incredible 40-meter deep basins and towering hills that will take you to the Sahara in seconds.\nThere are plenty of ways to observe and explore the dunes, including horse-drawn carriages, paragliding and sand-boarding, as well as an observation deck. There are even camels to add to the atmosphere. Read more about exploring Tottori\u2019s sand dunes .\nSuggested Activity\nJapan Rail Pass\nThe JR Pass is a 1 week pass that allows unlimited travel on Japan Rail lines throughout the country. This ticket is extraordinarily good value. *Restrictions: Can only be purchased by temporary visitor visa holders not already in Japan. ...\nYou can\u2019t visit Japan without seeing it, even if it is from the plane window or squinting into the distance at the Tokyo Met Observation tower \u2014it has to be done. Aside from being a famous landmark and symbol of the country, Mount Fuji is a natural wonder in its own right.\nWhether you choose to see it from across the lake in Hakone , or from Lake Kawaguchi , you can even climb a different mountain to see it from a height. If you\u2019re keen to conquer the beast yourself, see our Mt. Fuji climbing guide for some help\u2014there\u2019s nothing more stunning than a sunrise at the peak, and nothing as hard-earned either!\nKabira Bay, Ishigaki, Okinawa\nPhoto by Lily Crossley-Baxter\nOn the north coast of Ishigaki Island in Okinawa , Kabira Bay is one of the most beautiful tropical beaches in Japan, drawing thousands of visitors every year. The coral reefs and amazing animals just below the surface are as beautiful as the view.\nAlthough no swimming is allowed here due to currents, jellyfish and boats, you can cruise on a glass-bottomed boat to see the sealife. There are also tours to the uninhabited islands and you can kayak around them too. Snorkeling around the islands is the only way to enjoy the water and is carefully monitored. Read more about visiting Ishigaki .\nThe stunning Nachi Falls, Wakayama\nThe tallest uninterrupted waterfall in Japan, Nachi Falls is\u00a0133 meters tall and 13 meters wide, creating one of the most impressive sights in the country. With the Pagoda of the Seigantoji in front of it, this is one of the most beautiful views in Japan, with a magical air about it and well worth the journey to Wakayama to see it.\nWhile there, you can walk a short section of the Kumano Kodo trail to see Nachi Taisha, a shrine right beside the Buddhist Seigantoji Temple. The falls were originally the primary religious site, and were considered a point of natural power and beauty by the earliest Japanese people. However, a word of caution\u2014there are tales of lovestruck couples plunging to their deaths to be reborn in Kannon\u2019s paradise, so be careful at the top!\nThe bamboo groves of Arashiyama, Kyoto\nOne of the most photographed spots in Japan, the Sagano bamboo forest of Arashiyama is a sight to behold: with dappled sunlight and swaying trees, it\u2019s wonderfully calming. Reaching up to 20 meters tall, looking up can be quite dizzying, especially with a breeze, and the overwhelming beauty is enough to make you stop and stare.\nHome to Nonomiya Shrine and Tenryuji Temple , there is plenty to explore and although the path is only 200 meters long, you can stroll through at your own pace, making the most of the relaxing atmosphere. Read more about this Kyoto bamboo forest .\nPro tip: If you can\u2019t make it to Kyoto, check out a few bamboo forests in Tokyo instead.\nIriomote\u2019s mangroves, near Ishigaki, Okinawa\nCompletely different to the rest of Japan, Ishigaki and its surrounding islands are subtropical\u2014and nowhere more so than the untamed island of Iriomote. Largely undeveloped, the island has an abundance of natural resources to be explored by kayak, paddleboard , hiking or swimming\u2014perfect for the adventurers out there.\nThere are a number of tour guides on the island who can take you on half- or full-day trips to see the sights. You can also take a water-buffalo cart out to Yubu Island\u2014a subtropical garden with hundreds of varieties of trees and flowers. Read more about exploring Iriomote .\nAlpine views of Mount Yari, Nagano\nRight at the heart of the Japanese Alps, Mt. Yari is famed for its stunning ridges and ripples, catching snow to leave beautiful patterns. With views of Mt. Fuji from the top and incredible panoramas of the surrounding mountains, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s at the top of most hikers\u2019 bucket lists.\nThe first recorded ascent was made by priest and mountain ascetic Banryu in the Edo period, and the area was nicknamed the Japanese Alps by a British hiker named Gowland, who followed some 50 years later in 1880. The hiking trails are open from the end of April to early November, and the area is considered especially beautiful when covered in autumn leaves . Read more about one unusual hike to a remote onse hiddedn in the Alps.\nThe volcanos of Aogashima Island, Tokyo (technically)\nA more difficult place to reach, Aogashima is a small volcanic island 358 kilometers from Tokyo. It features one of the few double volcanos in the world. With only 160 residents, the island is home to the smallest village in Japan, and has a small school and post office.\nYou can camp on Aogashima, with incredible views of the night sky and a true natural escape from the rest of the world. The island is accessible by boat (four days a week, \u00a51,500 one way) or helicopter (\u00a511,500) from nearby Hachijojima (itself a one-hour flight from Haneda ). We didn\u2019t say it was easy, but it\u2019s certainly a natural wonder.\nThe rush of Shiraito Falls, Yamanashi\nThe 150-meter wide cascade in the foothills of Mount Fuji is one of the most accessible day trips from Tokyo and is truly stunning. The falls are among the most beautiful in Japan and are 25 meters high\u2014creating thin streams of rushing white water that resemble silk.\nThe site was protected in 1936 as a Japanese Natural Monument and is part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. There is a walking trail from the main road and a return bus once a day from Tokyo Station.\nThe blue seas of the Kerama Islands, Okinawa\nThe Kerama Islands are a slice of heaven, a few miles from the coast of the Okinawan mainland of Naha. The cluster features sandy beaches, coral reefs and even humpback whales. Of the 20 islands in total, only five are inhabited, with a few hostels, hotels and plenty of diving companies as well as kayak and snorkeling tours or rental gear.\nYou can relax into island life while enjoying the beaches, explore the uninhabited islands and hike to viewpoints for incredible sea views. Tokashiki is especially hilly, with incredible jungle-like walks and regular boats to the smaller islands. There are local restaurants, and after a few days, you\u2019ll never want to leave. Although it\u2019s one of the most popular destinations in Japan, we have a cheapo-guide to enjoying the blue seas of Okinawa here .\nThe magic of Yakushima, Kagoshima\nOh my god, look at that tree!\u00a0|\u00a0Photo by Lily Crossley-Baxter\nBelieved to be the inspiration for the Studio Ghibli film Princess Mononoke, Yakushima has Japan\u2019s most ancient forest, with trees up to 7000 years old. Despite heavy logging in the Edo period, the forest has now recovered and is protected as a National Park.\nTrees over 1000 years old are called Yakusugi (a combination of the Island\u2019s name and the Japanese word for cedar) and can be seen at many points on the island. As it is a subtropical island, there is frequent rainfall and often a dramatic mist rests in the forest. Read more about exploring Yakushima .\nThe 8 Hells of Beppu Onsen, Oita\nBeppu\u2019s hot springs await.\u00a0|\u00a0Photo by Yannick Dellafaille used under CC\nOne of the most famous hot spring (onsen) towns in Japan, Beppu is popular with visitors from across the country and beyond, with the city hosting eight different springs (the number being the same as the \u201ceight hells\u201d is a coincidence). One of them, Beppu Onsen, has a stunning collection of natural hot springs that are as beautiful to look at as they are amazing to step into.\nThe eight hells of Beppu is the name reserved for the particularly stunning selection of pools that range from fiery red to glassy blue\u2014along with one inhabited by crocodiles. The onsen are spread across two sites and are easily accessible by buses or walking.\nPro tip: First time bathing in a Japanese hot spring? Read our guide .\nFive honorary mentions\nThere were some spots that didn\u2019t quite make it by technicality, but are still incredible sights.\nThe Blue Pond \u2013 Hokkaido (Not actually natural)\nIt may look familiar from your computer screensaver of old, but it\u2019s a real thing, and it\u2019s genuinely that stunning in real life. Built as part of an erosion prevention\u00a0system on the island to prevent damage to the nearby town of Biei in case of volcanic eruption, the pond is a stunning blue color thanks to the natural minerals in the water. There isn\u2019t much to see nearby, but it is next to the onsen town of Shirogane, so you could always have a soak after enjoying the view! For an insight into the natural beauty of Hokkaido, take a look at our outdoor adventure guide .\nMount Aso, Kumamoto (Closed off due to safety concerns)\nThe largest volcano in Japan and one of the largest in the world, Mount Aso in Kumamoto has an incredible blue crater lake and is beautiful when viewed from afar as well. It erupted for the first time in 22 years in November 2014 and while no one was injured, debris was thrown over 3,000 feet into the air. The caldera (the area above the magma chamber which lies under the volcanic peaks) is one of the world\u2019s largest, with the active volcanic peaks within it.\nNote: Mount Aso erupted again in 2016. Due to recent increases in volcanic activity there is currently a no-entry perimeter of 1 kilometer and you cannot approach to see the crater. The ropeway is also currently closed.\nThe glowing squid of Toyama Bay, Toyama (March \u2013 June)\nPhoto by istock.com/tdub_video\nOne of the most magical sights in Japan, the firefly squid appear in Toyama Bay due to currents. Usually they are deep below the surface and not visible. With tiny photophores at the end of their tentacles, they create an incredible spectacle as millions swarm to create a sea of glowing blue. The squid are fished in the area but there are also sightseeing boats available, leaving early in the morning to get the best views around 1 kilometer from the shore. (Unfortunately it\u2019s a little tough to get decent shots of them!)\nNaruto whirlpools, Tokushima (Limited times)\nPhoto by istock.com/10max\nOff the Naruto Strait, the rush of tides between the Seto Inland Sea and the Pacific Ocean create a natural phenomenon known as the Naruto whirlpools. They happen twice a day and are stronger in summer and winter, and can reach up to 20 meters wide.\nNote: You should always check the schedules before you go. The whirlpools can be best seen from sightseeing cruises that run from Shikoku and Awaji Island.\nThe wedded rocks of Ise, Mie (we put a rope on them)\nA tad more accessible, one of the simplest and yet most beautiful views in Japan is the sun rising behind the wedded rocks in Ise. The Meoto-Iwa rocks are bound by a traditional rope made of braided rice stalks, and the largest\u2014Izanagi, the husband\u2014is 9 meters tall, while the wife\u2014Izanami\u2014is 6 meters tall. There is a small torii gate placed on Izanagi and there are ceremonies held three times a year to replace the rope, which weighs almost a ton.\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to visit during the summer months, you can see the sun rise directly between them, with Mt.

            "National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nBelow is a list of the 29 National Historic Landmarks you can find in our California State Parks.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Asilomar was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for the significant role it played in work of the YWCA, in the establishment of the Monterey Peninsula\u2019s resort industry, and as an outstanding example of the master architect Julia Morgan\u2019s work.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) provided accommodation for the young women who left the rural countryside for cities in search of low-paying jobs in factories and offices. The YWCA established educational and vocational classroom facilities, where these young women could improve their prospects by taking classes in practical subjects such as money management, sewing, cooking, and typing.\u00a0 Led by Phoebe Elizabeth Apperson, the YWCA purchased land in 1911 and hired architect Julia Morgan to design a camp that could both provide educational opportunities and a conference center for the association\u2019s members.\u00a0\u00a0 Established in 1913, Asilomar included a dining hall, meeting spaces and dorm rooms.\u00a0\u00a0 Although the YWCA maintained the facility until 1951, it was operated as an educational camp until the depression and a conference center in the 1940s.\u00a0 Asilomar is now part of the California State Park system as Asilomar State Beach and Conference Center.\u00a0 People continue to gather in the historic buildings and inspirational landscape for conferences and meetings in the historic buildings.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated a National Historic Landmark on July 4, 1961, the \u201cBig Four House\u201d was threatened by a redevelopment project that razed the entire block in 1967.\u00a0 It was moved out of redevelopment area and relocated to the north side of I street between Front and Second Streets to preserve this important piece of railroading history.\nThe building known as \u201cBig Four House\u201d was originally three separate buildings, the Stanford Building, the Huntington & Hopkins Building, and the Miller Building.\u00a0 Constructed adjacent to the original Sacramento Railway Station in 1851 and 1852, the buildings provided retail space and offices.\u00a0\u00a0 The first floors of these three buildings were used by merchants and the second floors were eventually finished as one floor occupied by Hopkins, Stanford, and Crocker\u2019s railroad enterprise. For the first eleven years (1862 \u2013 1873) the Central Pacific Railroad was operated from the second floor offices.\u00a0 By 1878, the individual buildings were united and over the years hosted retail shops, a hotel, a bar and a caf\u00e9.\u00a0 Today the \u201cBig Four House\u201d is shared by the California State Park Capital District offices and the California State Railroad Museum Library where researchers can discover the history of the railroads through original and rare documents.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Bodie was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961 for its significance as the finest example of a mining \u201cghost town\u201d in the West.\nBodie, once a bustling community of gold miners, with salons, hotels, shops, churches, and public buildings, experienced the rhythms of boom and bust that are common in mining communities from 1859 to 1942.\u00a0 During the peaks of gold mining, Bodie had up to fifty mining companies operating simultaneously with thousands of miners and thousands more people providing services such as meals, laundry, brewing, and metal work to the miners, their families and the companies they worked for. During the 1880 federal census 5,275 individuals were listed as residences of Bodie.\u00a0 They represented 43 states and territories, and 31 different countries from Arabia and Australia to Russia and Wales.\u00a0 Italian, Irish, English, Polish, Mexican, Swiss, and Chinese immigrants mixed with Paiute Native Americans and people born in every state in the nation.\u00a0 By the 1940 census, only 122 people claimed to live in Bodie.\u00a0 However, the diversity of the population remained and represented 24 states and six different countries.\u00a0 Today, the park is visited by an annual average of 200,000 people from around the world.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The Estudillo House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its significances as one of the oldest and finest examples of a\u00a0 Spanish-Mexican one-story town house in California.\nThe Estudillo House was constructed over a three year period from 1827 to 1829 in San Diego. The residence has a U-shape and features hand-hewn timbers and rafters secured with rawhide thongs.\u00a0 Don Jose Antonio Estudillo was a captain at the Presidio of San Diego.\u00a0 He was granted a residential lot where he constructed the adobe house. Today the Estudillo House is in the heart of Old Town San Diego State Historic Park which receives almost six million annual visitors drawn to the blend of history, culture, and strolling among the numerous shops.\nThe Estudillo House was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its significances as one of the oldest and finest examples of a\u00a0 Spanish-Mexican one-story town house in California. Constructed over a three year period from 1827 to 1829, the residence has a U-shape and features hand-hewn timbers and rafters secured with rawhide thongs.\u00a0 Don Jose Antonio Estudillo was a captain at the Presidio of San Diego.\u00a0 He was granted a residential lot where he constructed the adobe house.\u00a0 By 1829, Estudillo had acquired three ranches and was an influential member of the community, later serving as mayor and justice of the peace of San Diego.\u00a0 The Estudillo residence became the an important part of life in San Diego,\u00a0 church services and school classes were held in the hall until the 1850s and it was a place of shelter for women and children during times of revolution and war.\u00a0 The house remained in the Estudillo family until 1887 when it was abandoned.\u00a0 John D. Speckles purchased the ruined remains of the house in 1905 and began restoration work which was not concluded until 1969.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The Historic District of Coloma was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\nThe town of Coloma, located along the south fork of the American River, grew around Sutter\u2019s Mill, the site of gold discovery that began the greatest series of gold strikes in the North American continent and the global migration of miners and adventures to California.\u00a0 The mining camp evolved into a town and survived the depletion of gold in the 1850s by turning to agriculture. Today the remaining residences, businesses, and landscape testify to the pioneering spirit and lifestyle of the early residents and the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park gives visitors the opportunity to discover California\u2019s rich history through living history events, exploring local Native American culture and the diversity of the gold mining era.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Columbia, one of the best preserved gold rush mining towns in the Sierras, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\nA party of miners led by Dr. Thaddeus Hildreth discovered gold on March 27, 1850.\u00a0 Almost overnight a mining camp with over a thousand prospectors was established on the future site of Columbia.\u00a0 The Columbia Basin mining district was one of the riches gold producing regions in California.\u00a0 Although many mining camps disappeared after the mines played out, Columbia became a successful community.\u00a0 Fires spared only a few frame and brick buildings in 1854 and again in 1857.\u00a0\u00a0 Most of the buildings built after the 1857 fire were brick.\u00a0 Columbia reflects a California mining town for the period of 1854 to 1858.\u00a0 Thirty-nine buildings including hotels, saloons, restaurants, banks, offices, stores, residents, fraternal halls, churches, fire houses, and a school remain in the historic district. Today the living historic town continues with a mixture of park properties, small businesses, and residents providing visitors an opportunity to experience California\u2019s diverse history.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, the Commander\u2019s House, also known as the Rotchev House, is an excellent and rare example of Russian log architecture in the United States.\nThe log house appears to have been an early Russian cabin that was modified in 1836 to house the last settlement commander, Alexander Rotchev.\u00a0 Fort Ross, a fur and agricultural settlement, was established by the Russian American Company in 1812.\u00a0 The Russian outpost provided food by trade and production to the Russian-American Company\u2019s colony in Sitka, Alaska, as well as sea otter pelts and ship building.\u00a0 The settlement was active until 1841 when it was sold to John A. Sutter.\u00a0 While much of the fort was dismantled and sent to Sutter\u2019s Fort in Sacramento, the Rotchev House was left intact and occupied by subsequent land managers.\u00a0 Alexander Rotchev, his wife Elena, and their three children, Olga, Elena and Konstantin, lived here from 1838 to 1841.\u00a0 Alexander Rotchev was an intelligent, well-educated, and well-traveled man of the arts who took a position with the Russian American Company to support his wife, Princess Elena Pavlovna Gagarina, a descendant of the titled nobility, and their growing family.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The site of the Donner Party Camp was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961 for its significance in the settlement of the West.\nGeorge Donner and James Reed led 89 emigrants in a wagon train bound for California into the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the winter of 1846/1847.\u00a0 After delays in Nevada where the group lost both wagons and cattle, the emigrants continued their journey attempting to cross the High Sierras in the late autumn.\u00a0 However, the heavy November snows of the High Sierras forced the party to establish a camp for the winter.\u00a0 The harsh conditions and lack of food provisions led to the tragic loss of nearly half of the group.\u00a0 By December the food stores were nearly depleted and several members of the group left to seek help.\u00a0 The first of four relief expeditions from California did not reach the camp until February 1847.\u00a0 After the four month ordeal, only forty-seven members survived. Today visitors can camp, fish, and picnic at the park, as well explore Native American life, the 1840s emigration, the Chinese railroad builders, and auto travel at the visitor center.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated in 1981, the Folsom Powerhouse provided the first long distance transmission of power.\nIn 1895, when the powerhouse was put into service it represented a significant advance in the science of generating and transmitting electricity.\u00a0 The powerhouse utilized a water driven engine and the American River to spin coils of copper wire between magnets to produce an electric charge.\u00a0 Today one can view the penstocks, turbines, and huge transformers that made this transfer of power possible and learn about power generation and electric current at the visitor center.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961, Fort Ross was the largest single Russian trading center outside of Alaska.\nThe Russian American Company established Fort Ross as a fur and agricultural settlement in 1812.\u00a0 The Russian outpost provided food by trade and production to the Russian-American Company\u2019s colony in Sitka, Alaska, as well as sea otter pelts and ship building.\u00a0 The settlement was active until 1841 when it was sold to John A. Sutter.\u00a0 While much of the fort was dismantled and sent to Sutter\u2019s Fort in Sacramento, the Rotchev House was left intact and occupied by subsequent land managers.\u00a0 The settlement brought together Russian, Native-Alaskan, and Native American people on the California coast.\nThe fort continued to be a center of trade and agricultural production after the Russians left.\u00a0 Having changed hands several times, the land was purchased by the George and Mercedes Call in 1873.\u00a0 George Call operated 2,500 acres of ranch lands and orchards as well as a shipping company.\u00a0 He built a residence for his family, a school house for his nine children, and a variety of barns and out buildings.\u00a0 Although, George Call sold the 2\u00bd acres comprising the fort and its buildings to the California Historical Landmarks League in 1903, the Call ranch was held as one property until the last of the Call children died in 1976.\u00a0 Today, Fort Ross State Historic Park offers visitors many opportunities to explore the diverse history of Russian Settlement, Native American and Alaskan cultures, Californian ranching and agriculture, as well as underwater exploration of sunken ships.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 for its architectural significance, the Hearst San Simeon Estate was designed by Julia Morgan in collaboration with William Randolph Hearst.\nBorn in 1863, the son of banking magnet George Hearst, William Randolph Hearst grew up in San Francisco.\u00a0 Introduced to journalism at Harvard University, Hearst took over one of his father\u2019s newspapers after he left school.\u00a0 Publishing became a passion and a tool to influence politics and fund Hearst\u2019s interest which included in the development of his family\u2019s camping spot into the iconic Hearst Castle.\u00a0 Constructed over the decades between 1919 and 1951, the residence was never complete.\u00a0 Hearst worked closely with architect Julia Morgan, changing and expanding elements of the design as construction progressed.\u00a0 Also born in San Francisco, Julia Morgan was the first female architect to be licensed in California.\u00a0 Morgan was provided a treasure trove of art and historic artifacts collected from around the world by Hearst that both inspired her design but also challenged her technical expertise.\u00a0 Incorporating ancient and medieval elements into new construction demanded both an understanding of construction historic and modern materials and techniques but also a consideration of scale and design.\u00a0 Today, La Cuesta Encantada, now known as Hearst Castle, houses one of the finest art collections on the West Coast and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962, Jack London\u2019s Wolf House (1913), his wife Charmain\u2019s House of Happy Walls (1919) and their graves are located amongst the fields and agricultural buildings of the Londons\u2019 Beauty Ranch.\nJohn Griffith London (1876 \u2013 1916) grew up in poverty in Oakland, California.\u00a0 At the age of 17, he left home to crew on a sealing ship and began a life of adventure.\u00a0 London\u2019s experiences and observations during his travels inspired and colored his many articles, short stories, and novels, making him the most popular author of his time.\u00a0 A prolific writer, London completed 51 books, hundreds of short stories and articles from 1900 until his death in 1916.\u00a0 Many his works were completed at the Beauty Ranch which he purchased in 1905.\nThe Beauty Ranch was first developed by Louis Csomortanyi as the Tokay Vineyard in 1859.\u00a0 Cottage, out buildings and winery were later constructed.\u00a0 Charles and Henry Kohler purchased the property in 1866, making a number of improvements and using the property at the center of operation for Kohler and Frothing.\u00a0 The Kohlers created a model modern winery with vast land holdings throughout Sonoma.\u00a0 The property was again transformed as a model of modern agricultural production, when London applied scientific and ancient techniques in crop and animal production.\u00a0 Today, visitors can explore the winery buildings, as well as the agricultural and literary pursuits of Jack and Charmian London.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The Castro Adobe was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1970 as a significant example of 19th centuryMonterey Colonial architecture.\nCompleted in 1841, the Castro Adobe is one of the best examples of Monterey Colonial architecture, with a mix of adobe and timber framing.\u00a0 Juan Jose Castro, son of one of the original members of the De Anza Expedition, constructed the two-story hacienda which served as headquarters for the 8,800-acre Rancho San Andres.\u00a0 A grand specimen of residential architecture from the Mexican Rancho period (1821-1848), the adobe was considered the most lavish residence in Santa Cruz County, featuring the first dance floor (fandango) and indoor kitchen in the region.\u00a0 Today adobe is the only remaining building of the Rancho era in the Pajaro Valley and is being preserved and interpreted though a partnership between California State Parks and Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States. Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its significance as an outstanding example of a restoration of a mission complex, La Purisima Mission was the first place that archeology was applied to a restoration effort.\nAt the site of the future town of Lompoc, Father Presidente Fermin de Lasu\u00e9n founded Misi\u00f3n La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n De Mar\u00eda Sant\u00edsima (Mission of the Immaculate Conception of Most Holy Mary) on December 8, 1787 as the 11th of 21 Franciscan Missions in California.\u00a0 The mission complex was laid out in the standard format established in the earlier missions.\u00a0 However, in 1812 the adobe buildings failed during an earthquake. Upon application, the Pope granted permission to move the mission to a nearby valley.\u00a0 Reconstructed with a unique plan, the mission developed large agricultural holdings and baptized several thousand Chumash Indians into the Catholic Church.\u00a0 As the mission prospered over 100 large and small adobe buildings were a water system was constructed.\nIn 1834 the Mexican government secularized all mission properties, including La Purisima.\u00a0 Although some of the large buildings were used over the years for private ranching operations, the buildings fell into disrepair.\u00a0 A hundred years after secularization, La Purisima became the site of one of the largest preservation efforts in the United States.\u00a0 The New Deal funded Civilian Conservation Corps, with the guidance of the National Park Service,\u00a0 to stabilize the surviving buildings, conduct exhaustive research and archeology, and reconstruct many of the buildings and structures that had been lost over time.\u00a0 Today La Purisima State Historic Park evokes a time when California was a frontier where old and new world orders struggled for survival.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated in 1960, the Larkin House is significant as the prototype for the Monterey Colonial style of architecture and one of several National Historic Landmarks in the Monterey State Historic Park.\nThomas Oliver Larkin, a thirty-year old merchant and builder from New England came to Monterey in 1832.\u00a0 He quickly became an influential community leader and established a prosperous business in commerce and real estate development throughout California.\u00a0 Larkin began constructing a home for his growing family in 1835, applying traditional architectural forms to the local materials.\u00a0 The adobe residence was completed in 1837 with a design that incorporating timber supports for the upper story, allowing a lighter shell of adobe bricks and greater flexibility in window placement than in traditional adobe construction.\u00a0 In 1843, Larkin was appointed as the first United States Consul in California which was governed by Mexico and played an important role in the annexation of California by the United States.\u00a0 After statehood was granted to California, Larkin sold his Monterey property.\u00a0 It was reacquired by the Larkin family in 1922 and sequentially donated to the State of California in 1957.\u00a0 Today, the home and gardens are open weekly to visitors of the Monterey State Historic Park.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nLocke Boarding House is a contributor to the Locke Historic District, a Chinese-American Community established in 1915 and designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1990.\u00a0 More than fifty remaining commercial and residential buildings constitute the village of Locke, the largest and most intact surviving example of an historic rural Chinese-American community in the United States and the only remaining example in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\u00a0 Once known as the Jack Ross Boardinghouse, Locke Boarding House was constructed in 1909, prior to the formal development of the town.\u00a0 Chinese men working on the construction of the Southern Pacific Railroad boarded in the small establishment which was located near the Southern Pacific Railroad shipping warehouse.\u00a0 The Kuramoto family operated the boarding house from 1921 until they were interned during World War II in 1942.\u00a0 Today, the boarding house is a museum that provides visitors a glimpse into the past.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nOne of only two Recreational Demonstration Areas (RDA) constructed by the WPA west of the Mississippi, Mendocino Woodlands is one of the best remaining examples of the group campgrounds designed to provide recreational opportunities on previously depleted agricultural or logged land.\u00a0 The rustic-style camp buildings and cultural landscape was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997.\u00a0 Funded by the New Deal legislation of 1933, the National Park Service developed the idea of RDAs which drew upon two movements, agriculture and social reform.\u00a0 Over exploited land, either farm or forestry land was restored to combat soil erosion which contributed to the dust bowl effect in America\u2019s heartland, was chosen for RDAs.\u00a0 Park designers were focused on developing parks that would provide group camping opportunities to underserved, intercity, and lower income communities.\u00a0 The buildings reflect the inspiration for the idea of restoration through nature, build of local redwood logs and stone in the park rustic style.\u00a0 While forty-six RDAs were developed, only two were located on the west coast.\u00a0 Today, Mendocino Woodlands continues to provide groups the opportunity to commune with nature and escape from everyday concerns.\nMission Santa Ines\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The mills are a contributor to the Mission Santa Ines National Historic Landmark District.\u00a0 Designated in 1999, Mission Santa Ines is one of the nation\u2019s best preserved Spanish mission complex.\nFounded in 1804, Santa Ines was the 19th out of 21 Spanish missions in Alta California.\u00a0 The historic district includes an authentic rural setting, original buildings, industrial structures, archeological remains, and collections of art and interior furnishings.\u00a0 Located in the Santa Ynez Valley, Mission Santa Ines lay between the existing missions of Santa Barbara and La Purissima.\u00a0 The mission was arranged in the standard quadrangle, with church buildings on one wing, the padres residences, offices, and work rooms on another, and the dormitories, shops, work rooms, granaries, and storage areas making up the last two wings.\u00a0 Due to the diversity of the facilities and capacity of the reservoirs, the mission\u2019s mill complex and reservoirs are unsurpassed by that of any other California or southwestern mission.\u00a0 Constructed of stone and lime mortar, the complex features two water driven mills, a fuller mill to process wet woolen cloth into a finer textile and a grist mill for grinding grain into flour.\u00a0 Today, the mission continues to be an active parish offers a variety of tours.\u00a0 The mills are owned by California State Parks but managed by Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation, who offers tours by appointment only.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nCalifornia State Parks has several buildings, such as the Old Custom House, the Larkin House and the First Theater, that are contributors to the Monterey Old Town Historic District.\u00a0 In 1970, two hundred years after the founding of the presidio, the district was designated as a National Historic Landmark as the Spanish and later Mexican capital of California from 1776 to 1848.\u00a0 The discontinuous district consists of twenty-one residential, commercial, and public adobe buildings dating from 1814 to 1855.\u00a0 Today, visitors can tour the California State Park owned properties within the historic district in between shopping and eating in the historic core.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Old Sacramento Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 as a commercial center from the gold rush era.\nThe Sacramento River was the major transportation route for people and goods during the gold rush and until the development of rail in California.\u00a0 The first track was laid to Sacramento in 1852 and while rail lines connected various communities within the state from 1852, the transcontinental railroad linking the west to the east was not completed until 1869.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the development of the transcontinental railroad, the river port of Sacramento continued to be a vital hub of commerce for the state.\u00a0 California State Parks maintains two of the remaining contributing seven buildings, the BF Hastings Building/Pony Express Terminal, and the Big Four Building.\u00a0 Both of these buildings are also individually designated as National Historic Landmarks.\u00a0 Today, Old Sacramento reflects a time when the river port was the gateway to the gold rush.\u00a0 Visitors can wander down the cobble stone streets and visit a variety of shops and restaurants in between the exploring the California State Railroad Museum and the other historic museums throughout the historic district.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nThe Petaluma Adobe was completed in 1846 and is the largest existing example of residential adobe architecture.\u00a0 The two-story Monterey Colonial style residence was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1970.\u00a0 Salvador Vallejo constructed the adobe over a nine year period for General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, his older brother.\u00a0 General Vallejo was sent to California by the Mexican government and for his service he was granted 66,000 acres which he operated as a rancho.\u00a0 While Vallejo resided in Sonoma, the Petaluma Adobe was the headquarters of his ranch.\u00a0 It provided living space for ranch supervisors on the second floor and factory operations on the first floor.\u00a0 Unlike most ranchos which operated using individual buildings for specific tasks, the work areas for Vallejo\u2019s ranch were all located under the same roof.\u00a0 A Native American village, which housed the ranch workers, was located nearby.\u00a0 In the early years the ranch supported the needs of Vallejo\u2019s troops and financed his other interests after statehood.\u00a0 However after the gold rush, cost rose and the ranch became increasingly less profitable.\u00a0 Vallejo sold the building and some of the property in 1857.\u00a0 Today, environmental living programs and tours bring California\u2019s early history alive for school children and visitors.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nThe BF Hastings Building was the western terminus of the Pony Express from April 1860 to March 1861.\u00a0 Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1961, at one time the building also housed the State Supreme Court and Wells, Fargo and Company.\u00a0 The two-story brick building was constructed after the devastating 1852 fire which destroyed most of the business district.\u00a0 Benjamin F. Hastings constructed the building and rented it to Wells, Fargo, and Company, who occupied the building from 1854 to 1858.\u00a0 The State Supreme Court occupied the second floor from 1854 until a new facility was constructed in 1869.\u00a0 The building also housed offices of the Theodore D. Judah chief engineer for the Sacramento Valley Railroad, the state\u2019s first railroad. Restored in the 1970s, the BF Hastings building is an important contributor to the Old Sacramento Historic District.\u00a0 Today, visitors can explore the Wells Fargo History Museum and Old Sacramento Visitor Center which currently occupies the building.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The San Juan Bautista Plaza Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 as an excellent representation of a 19th century village.\nThe historic district of San Juan Bautista Plaza consists of five buildings, including the mission church, Plaza Hotel, Castro House, Plaza Hall, Plaza Stables, constructed on a traditional Spanish-Mexican colonial plaza.\u00a0 The first building, the San Juan Bautista Mission Church (1803-1813) is the largest out of the 21 Spanish mission churches and has continually been operating as a Catholic Church since 1812.\u00a0 After the missions began secularized by the Mexican government in 1834, mission lands were granted to Mexican citizens and soldiers.\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Tiburcio Castro, a former Spanish soldier, received San Juan Bautista Mission lands, sold and divided much of the land among his family and friends.\u00a0 The Jos\u00e9 Castro House (1839-1841) was constructed for his son, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Castro.\u00a0 The other buildings, the Plaza Hotel (1858), the Plaza Stables (1861), and the Plaza Hall (1868), represent a great economic boom period from 1850 to the 1870s for the area.\u00a0 Today, the five adobe and redwood buildings are open to visitors and feature interpretive programs for all ages.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\nThe site of the raising of the Bear Flag during the revolt of 1846, Sonoma Plaza was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and consists of twelve one and two story buildings from the Mexican Period.\u00a0 California State Parks manages several of the district contributors including the Sonoma Barracks, Toscano Hotel, kitchen and annex, the site of Casa Grande, Casa Grande servants quarters, the Blue Wing Inn and the Sonoma Mission.\u00a0 The last of the Spanish missions in California, the Sonoma Mission was founded in 1823.\u00a0 After Mexico won its independence, the government began to secularize the missions it 1834.\u00a0 The Sonoma Pueblo was established as a Mexican military base in 1835 in response to Russian settlement at Fort Ross.\u00a0 General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo oversaw the settlement of the mission property and the military operation.\u00a0 Today, the plaza features a mixture of religious, military, and commercial properties that testify to the important role that Sonoma played in California\u2019s history.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated an National Historic Landmark in 1987, the Leland Stanford House represents both an excellent example of Renaissance Revival architecture and the life of Leland Stanford, governor and senator of California, rail road industrialist, one of the \u201cBig Four\u201d who built the transcontinental railroad, and founder of Stanford University.\nArchitect Seth Babson designed the original house for Sacramento merchant Shelton C. Fogus.\u00a0 When completed in 1857, the residence was a simple square block house with five symmetrical bays.\u00a0 The Stanfords purchased the home in 1861, just prior to Leland Sanford\u2019s first term as governor of California.\u00a0 An extensive renovation of the house in 1871 raised the building and added an additional floor below, tripling the size of the original house.\u00a0 The building was further renovated when it was donated to the Catholic Church by the Stanfords and housed an orphanage.\u00a0 California State Parks returned the building to its 1871 design and it currently host\u2019s events for the California governor\u2019s office, international dignitaries, and is open for tours.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Sutter\u2019s Fort represents the first pioneer settlement in Sacramento and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.\nJohn Augustus Sutter was a man of action and opportunity.\u00a0 Sutter came to the United States from Germany at the age of 31.\u00a0 He traveled widely across the continent and beyond, arriving in Yerba Buena, California in 1839.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By 1840, Sutter became a naturalized citizen of Mexico with permission to found a settlement in the Central Valley.\u00a0 He constructed an adobe with Native American labor on a small rise near the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers.\u00a0 Sutters\u2019s Fort was the first piece of his empire which would include a 50,000 acre land grant, Sutter\u2019s mill gold was discovered creating a global migration to California, and Fort Ross, the Russian agricultural and ship building colony.\u00a0 After the discovery of gold, John Sutter signed his Sacramento holdings over to his son, John A. Sutter, Jr.\u00a0\u00a0 His son began to organize the residences and helped found Sacramento City.\nPoor health kept Sutter, Jr. home bound for many years, allowing Sutter\u2019s Fort to fall in disrepair.\u00a0 Following his death in 1897, the Native Sons of the Golden West rallied to save the historic site which had been reduced to one building and remnants of the walls.\u00a0 The Native Sons purchased the fort in 1890 and the State of California completed its restoration in 1893.\u00a0 The fort has been an important part of the California State Park system since 1937.\u00a0 Today it is open to the public for tours and thousands of school children visit each year.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 The oldest buildings in California, the US Custom House was one of the first historic sites to be designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\nThe Mexican government constructed the oldest portion of the two story adobe building in 1827 as two-room, one story building to collect custom duties on British, American, and South American goods shipped into Monterey Bay.\u00a0\u00a0 American Trader and entrepreneur Thomas Larkin, under contract with the Mexican government, expanded the building in 1841 and again between 1843 and 1846.\u00a0 The first American flag was raised to proclaim California as part of the United States at the Custom House on July 7, 1846.\u00a0 The structure continued its civic function as a United States custom house from 1848 to 1868.\nIt was later occupied as a residence and the as lodging rooms after being restored by the Natives Sons of the Golden West in 1900.\u00a0 Incorporated into the California State Park system in 1930, today the Custom House is open to the public for tours and part of the Monterey State Historic Parks.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997, the United States Immigration Station, Angel Island was the primary West Coast portal for immigrants to enter the United States from 1910 to 1940.\nDuring World War II the facility was used as a Prisoner of War Camp housing German and Japanese prisoners of war and members of the Italian Service Unit.\u00a0 Declared obsolete in 1946, the Angel Island became a state park in 1963.\u00a0 The majority of immigrants processed and detained at the Immigration Station came from Asia, including China, Japan, India, and the Philippines.\u00a0 Discriminatory practices against Asian immigrants led to brutal treatment during grueling weeks of testimony over the months of detention.\u00a0 Today the Immigration Station at Angel Island State Park stands as a reminder of the trials immigrants suffered to enter the United States and contributes to the healing process while interpreting the diverse cultures that contribute to our nation.\nNational Historic Landmarks (NHLs) are nationally significant historic places designated by the Secretary of the Interior because they possess exceptional value or quality in illustrating or interpreting the heritage of the United States.\u00a0 Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990 as an important work of folk art that is both sculpture and architecture, Watts Towers were created by Italian immigrant Simon Rodia over a period of 33 years.\nIn the space that was once Rodia\u2019s garden and around his house he created a monumental work of mosaic.\u00a0 Rodia collected seashells, ceramics, glass, and other materials to dress the metal spires he constructed from pipes and pieces of iron and steel.\u00a0 Below the towers are walls, an entrance, ship sculpture and gazebo.\u00a0 His personal mission became public inspiration as the delicate spires soar over the rooftops of the Watts neighborhood.\u00a0 Upon completing the towers in 1954, Rodia gave a friend his property and he left.\u00a0 The house burned down in 1955 and a protracted battle to save the towers from destruction was concluded in 1959.\u00a0 Today Watts Towers is the smallest park in the California State Park system.\u00a0 It is managed in partnership by the City of Los Angeles and is the site of a popular annual music festival.\nRelated Pages\n"

            "China\u2019s 7 Most Significant Historical Sites You Should Visit\nChina has a history of thousands of years, which gives it a lot of historical sites. The seven most significant are the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Terracotta Army, and the Potala Palace, the Summer Place, the Mogao Grottoes, and the three Confucian sites. All of these are UNESCO World Heritage.\n1. The Great Wall: the Longest Defensive System in the World\nChinese: \u957f\u57ce ch\u00e1ng ch\u00e9ng /channg chnng/\nlocation: Beijing, the capital of China\nThe Great Wall of China is one of the greatest sights in the world. It's an ancient defensive architecture. The \"Long Wall\" has a long history \u2014 more than 2,300 years. It was built in different areas by different states/dynasties to protect different territorial borders.\nThe entire Great Wall of China zigzags across the mountains of northern China. We highly recommend hiking along the best-protected sections of the Great Wall: Mutianyu and Jinshanling .\nChinese: \u6545\u5bab g\u00f9 g\u014dng /goo gong/\nlocation: Beijing, the capital of China\nThe Forbidden City (or the Palace Museum) is one of the must-visit attractions for travelers to China. It used to be an imperial palace in the Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing (1644\u20131911) dynasties.\nThe layout of this palace is strictly according to Chinese fengshui theory. China\u2019s best-preserved imperial palace is the world\u2019s largest ancient palatial structure (7.2 ha. or 17.8 ac.), the essence and culmination of traditional Chinese architectural accomplishment.\nChinese: \u5175\u9a6c\u4fd1 b\u012bng m\u01ce y\u01d2ng /bing maa yong/\nlocation: Xi'an\nThe museum, with three pits containing the Terracotta Army , covers an area of 22,780 square meters. Over 8,000 life-size terracotta soldiers and horses, and more than 10,000 bronze weapons were unearthed in these three pits.\nThe Terracotta Army is candidate for the title \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d and the is largest military museum underground. An interesting fact is that all the terracotta soldiers were made to face east towards Emperor Qin's enemies of the Warring States Period (475\u2013221 BC).\nChinese: \u5e03\u8fbe\u62c9\u5bab b\u00f9 d\u00e1 l\u0101 g\u014dng /boo daa laa gong/\nlocation: Lhasa (Tibet Autonomous Region)\nIf you are interested in Tibetan culture, the Potala Palace is the attraction which you should not miss. It was first built as the palace of Songtsen Gampo (617\u2013650), founder of the Tu-Bo Dynasty (\u5410\u8543\u738b\u671d). After being rebuilt in the 17th century, it was the residence of Dalai Lamas.\nThere are plenty of precious historical relics in the palace, including over 10,000 Buddha statues made of gold, silver, jade, wood, or clay, and about 10,000 thangkas (scroll paintings related to Budhhism). The gorgeous mural paintings, wooden carvings, and color paintings used for decoration are outstanding.\nChinese: \u9890\u548c\u56ed y\u00ed h\u00e9 yu\u00e1n /ee her ywen/\nlocation: Beijing, the capital of China\nThe Summer Palace is China\u2019s largest imperial garden. UNESCO added this 300-hectare (740-acre) site to the World Heritage List in 1998, and described it as \u201c...a masterpiece of Chinese landscape garden design. The natural landscape of hills and open water is combined with artificial features such as pavilions, halls, palaces, temples and bridges to form a harmonious ensemble of outstanding aesthetic value.\u201d\nThe Summer Palace was a royal summer resort in the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911), so the architectures and the layout there are quite exquisite. Boat cruises are available on Kunming Lake. There are numerous stores in Suzhou Street, selling souvenirs like antiques, snacks, silk, jewelry, and tea. The shop assistants there are dressed in the costumes of the Qing Dynasty.\nChinese: \u83ab\u9ad8\u7a9f m\u00f2 g\u0101o k\u016b /mor gaoww koo/\nlocation: Dunhuang\nThe Mogao Grottoes are famous for their exquisite mural paintings and Buddha statues. It has 735 grottoes, 450,000 square meters of mural paintings, 2,415 colored Buddha statues made of clay, and more than 50,000 historical relics. All of these make the Mogao Grottoes the largest and the most significant \u201choly land\u201d of Buddhist art.\nThe Mogao Grottoes' first carving was in 366, and with a contruction period spanning 16 dynasties, they are a summation of Buddhist art. The Mogao Grottoes are near an important city on the ancient Silk Road \u2014 Dunhuang, where you can see Crescent Spring (a miniature oasis in a pristine desert).\n7. The Three Confucius Sites\nChinese: \u4e09\u5b54 s\u0101n k\u01d2ng /san kong/\nThree confucius sites includes: Kong Family Mansion, Kong Family Mansion, Temple of Confucius\nlocation: Qufu\nConfucianism is a cornerstone of Chinese civilization. The Three Confucius Historical Sites (\u4e09\u5b54 San Kong) are all in Qufu, Shandong Province. Ancient architectural buildings, ancient stone tablets, and Confucius culture are the highlights.\nThe Kong Family Mansion was where the descendants of Confucius lived. It is huge and designed to reflect Confucian philosophy in its separation of areas for work, reception, and relaxation. The 480 rooms house a treasure of relics including imperial calligraphy.\nThe Cemetery of Confucius has become the graveyard of the Kong family, and more than 100,000 of Confucius\u2019 descendants are buried there. It is called Kong Lin ('Confucius' Forest').\nQufu Confucius Temple is the second largest scale ancient architectural complex in the world, after the Forbidden City. The temple was originally built as Confucius\u2019 house, and was changed into a temple to worship Confucius in the second year after his death. After that, extension of the temple continued, and today\u2019s 95,000 square meters was completed in the Yongzheng Period (1722\u20131735) of the Qing Dynasty.\nRecommended Historical China Tours\nTemple of Heaven, Beijing\nThere are some bestsellers including some of these historical sites:\n11-Day Classic Wonders Tour \u2014 Beijing, Xi\u2019an, Guilin, Yangshuo, Shanghai\nYou Might Like\n"

Part of the proposed Thai-Burma Railway Line, also known as the Death Railway, it was part of Japan\u2019s ambitious schemes to connect the neighbouring countries by railroad. Built using mainly forced labour, many people lost their lives building the railway and the bridge.\nState Tower\nOne of the tallest buildings in Bangkok , State Tower sprang into public awareness thanks to the 2011 hit movie The Hangover Part II. Parts of the film were shot in the Sky Bar at the top of the tower, part of the high-class Lebua hotel .

            "You are here:\nPublished: 10 July 2019\nCharlotte Boswell\nFrom bustling cities and golden temples to tropical islands and colourful tribal villages, Thailand is one of Asia's most welcoming and fascinating countries that draws millions of visitors every year. It is home to many fascinating historical, cultural and natural landmarks. Here is a list of our favourite landmarks in Thailand .\n1.\u00a0The Grand Palace, Bangkok\nA trip to Bangkok would not be complete without a visit to the spectacular Grand Palace, a collection of impressive temples and structures in Rattanakosin, the historic centre of the city. Built by the early kings of the Chakri dynasty, this vast complex is home to shimmering gold palaces, intricate Buddha statues and over 50 temples including Wat Phra Kaeo, Thailand\u2019s oldest temple which houses the thousand-year-old Emerald Buddha. The Thai Royal Family no longer live here so visitors have the freedom to explore the buildings and get up close to throne halls, royal stables and government buildings.\n2.\u00a0The Emerald Lagoon, Ang Thong Marine Park\nThe 40-something jagged jungle islands of Ang Thong Marine Park stretch across the aquamarine sea in the Gulf of Thailand , each one featuring sheer limestone cliffs, powder-sand beaches and hidden turquoise lagoons. Perhaps one of the most famous spots of this marine park is the Emerald Lagoon. Made famous by Alex Garland\u2019s cult-classic novel The Beach, it features a glistening green lake enclosed by jungle-clad karsts rising out of the water. Although the lagoon is incredibly inviting, visitors are not able to swim in it keeping the water beautifully pristine and makes for stunning photo opportunities.\n3.\u00a0Sukhothai Historical Park, Sukhothai\nFounded in 1238, Sukhothai is one of Thailand\u2019s most spectacular archaeological sites that previously formed the capital of the Thai Empire for around 140 years. Today the remains of Old Sukhothai are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site which in turn forms part of a larger historical park. A vast site originally protected by ramparts, ditches and moats, it is believed that in its heyday the city was home to almost 300,000 people. Having fallen into disrepair over the years, Old Sukhothai has been thoughtfully restored where highlights include the Wat Mahathat complex which was completed in 1345 AD, Wat Sra Sri and King Ramkhamhaeng\u2019s statue and the impressive Wat Sri Chum.\n4.\u00a0Wat Arun, Bangkok\nLocated on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok , Wat Arun is one of Bangkok\u2019s most unique Buddhist temples. It is known as the Temple of the Dawn as when the very first rays of light strike the temple it creates an iridescent sheen that glows over the river. The temple is home to colourful pagodas and spires that tower over the water; it is recommended to climb up one of the ornate structures for spectacular views over the city.\n5.\u00a0Khao Yai National Park, Hin Tung\nThailand\u2019s first national park, Khao Yai is considered to be the country\u2019s finest. A UNESCO World Heritage site made up of mainly rainforest and bamboo forest, the reserve is home to elephant, Asiatic black bear, slow loris, gibbon and rare Indochinese tiger. During a visit to Khao Yai National Park there many activities to choose from including walking trails to see Great hornbill and white-handed gibbon, a night safari to spot nocturnal animals, hikes to see the beautiful orchids that line the paths to various waterfalls and the chance to see the endangered Siamese crocodile.\n6.\u00a0Ayutthaya Historical Park, Ayutthaya\nFounded in the mid-14th century, Ayutthaya became the second Siamese capital after Sukhothai and remained so until 1767. During this time, Ayutthaya flourished to become not only one of the world's largest cities but also as a centre of global diplomacy and commerce with trading links to much of Asia, Arabia and Europe. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ayutthaya is dotted with reliquary towers and vast monasteries which provide an indication of the city's former splendour with highlights including Wat Ratchaburana, Wat Chai Wattanaram and Wat Phra Mahathat.\n7.\u00a0Wat Rong Khun, Chiang Rai\nKnown worldwide as the White Temple, Wat Rong Khun is one of the most spectacular and fascinating landmarks in Thailand . Located in Chiang Rai, the temple is known for its striking and gleaming white designs and fairy tale-like appearance and is home to countless gates and sculptures. Although the temple may look ancient, it was actually only built in 1997 after being designed by local Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat. As you cross the bridge on entry, be inspired by the beautiful lake reflections of the opulent temple whilst also passing hundreds of outstretched hands that reach out from the ground.\n8.\u00a0Cheow Larn Lake, Khao Sok National Park\nWith its karst scenery and thickly forested interior, beautiful Khao Sok National Park in Southern Thailand has extraordinary biodiversity supporting elephant, tiger and gibbon as well as hundreds of bird species. It is also home to Cheow Larn Lake, an artificial lake constructed in 1987, which is a beautiful emerald colour framed by green rainforest and limestone karsts. It is possible to stay on Cheow Larn Lake in floating lodges or luxury tents; a once in a lifetime experience. Wake early to watch the sunrise, listen to the monkeys calling and birds singing and take a kayak through the calm waters to spot wildlife.\n9.\u00a0Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, Chiang Mai\nOne of Chiang Mai\u2019s finest and most opulent temples, Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, is home to a glittering golden pagoda surrounded by beautiful pavilions, buildings and statues including a relic of the Lord Buddha. Sitting atop a hill means that visitors must climb more than 300 steps to reach the temple, however the views over the city and surrounding mountains are unrivalled and worth the climb. Once at the top, the outer terrace boasts small shrines, trees, flowers and statues, while the inner terrace is where you\u2019ll find the main tiered pagoda as well as Buddha statues in various poses.\n10.\u00a0Phimai Historical Park, Phimai\nSimilar in style as the iconic Angkor Wat in Cambodia , Prasat Hin Phimai in the Phimai Historical Park is one of the finest examples of Khmer architecture in Asia. Built in the 11th century, this complex is home to some of Thailand\u2019s oldest and most significant temples surrounded by moats and ancient walls. Visitors can explore the impressive Buddhist temples as well as scenic lotus ponds, crumbling bridges and ancient galleries where you can see a number of beautifully preserved statues.\n11.\u00a0Khao Phing Kan, Phang Nga Bay\nOne of Thailand\u2019s most iconic natural landmarks, Khao Phing Kan is more commonly known as James Bond Island due to appearing in the 1974 Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun. Located in the scenic Phang Nga Bay, the spire-like limestone karst rises up from shimmering waters with other greenery-clad rocks in the background. Take a day trip from Krabi or Phuket to explore the beautiful area and enjoy kayaking around the jutting island for unbeatable views.\n12.\u00a0M.R. Kukrit Heritage House, Bangkok\nM.R. Kukrit Pramot was a prominent figure in Thailand; he created Thailand\u2019s first political party and became Prime Minister during the turbulent 1970\u2019s.

Learn about their way of life, meditate with them, and try their delicious vegetarian food.\nTake a peek into North Korea from the DMZ border (demilitarized zone).\nSeeing an ancient Korean palace from centuries ago restored to its original beauty and colors.\nThe food! Kimchi jjigae (a spicy stew), budae jjigae (literally \u2018army stew\u2019), samgyeopsal (thick slices of pork cooked at your table), and gimbap (rice and veggies in a seaweed wrap) as a quick snack.\nSampling local spirits. Such as soju (a vodka-like spirit), maekju (the Korean word for beer), makgeolli (a rice wine), or bokbunja (a Korean plum wine).\nSoaking at the jimjilbang (day spa / public bathhouse).\nIMPORTANT NOTE\nSouth Korea has reported 8,000 confirmed cases of coronaviraus as of March 12th.\nThere is a Level 3 Travel Alert in effect for South Korea from the CDC.\n1.

With 52 different designated sites spread across the area, you\u2019ll definitely be in for an educational day. While in Gyeongju, you don\u2019t want to miss the Bulguksa Temple and Seokguram Grotto - where a softly-lit Buddha statue sits in a dome facing the direction of the sea.\n2. Temple Stay\nIt\u2019s not everyday that you can stay in a temple where monks currently reside and get a glimpse into their daily life. For one night, you get to learn about their values and practices, eat Korean temple food, practice meditation, and sleep in a humble guestroom. You may find it eye-opening, and perhaps take something away from this experience.\n3. DMZ\nThe DMZ, where South and North Korea meet, is a weapons-free buffer zone between the two countries.

After using the classic steam, sauna, and salt rooms, you\u2019ll also come across snack, nap, and even exercise rooms!\n6. Bukchon Hanok Village\nA traditional house neighborhood with many small alleyways, cement walls, and tiled roofs that will make you feel as though you\u2019ve transported back in time.

Jeonju Hanok Village\nWith over 800 traditional hanok houses that remain inside the otherwise modern city, Jeonju is a quaint and charming town that makes for a relaxing visit.

Jagalchi Fish Market\nThe country\u2019s largest seafood market, located in the beachfront city Busan . Visitors and locals alike will come here to find all kinds of seafood. You can bargain with the cheery ajummas (grandmas) who are eager to practice their English. You may find them selling sea squirts, sea cucumbers, and other sorts of fish that are uncommon in western countries. After you\u2019ve bought your catch of the day, bring it upstairs to any of the restaurants that will happily prepare it for you however you\u2019d like.\nExcellent 18 Great 1 Average 0 Disappointing 0 Terrible 0\nValue\n5.0\nOperator Urban Adventures\nI have been on some full on trips November 2019\n4.0\nI have been on some full on trips but this was at the top of the scale.

Sus edificios y el trazado de sus calles son un fiel reflejo de la combinaci\u00f3n de estilos arquitect\u00f3nicos, aut\u00f3ctonos y extranjeros, que ha dado su fisionom\u00eda singular a este sitio \u00fanico en su g\u00e9nero.\nsource: UNESCO/ERI\n\u53e4\u90fd\u30db\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\nOude stad Hoi An\nDe oude stad Hoi An is een bijzonder voorbeeld van een traditionele handelshaven in Zuidoost-Azi\u00eb die volledig en uitzonderlijk goed bewaard is gebleven. Het merendeel van de gebouwen is gebouwd in de traditionele 19e en 20e-eeuwse bouwstijl. Zowel de gebouwen als het stratenplan weerspiegelen inheemse en buitenlandse invloeden. De stad kent veel religieuze gebouwen zoals pagodes, tempels en vergaderhuizen, ontstaan door toedoen van de havengemeenschap in Hoi An. De traditionele levensstijl, godsdienst en (culturele) gewoonten zijn bewaard gebleven en veel festivals vinden nog steeds jaarlijks plaats.\nOutstanding Universal Value\nBrief synthesis\nHoi An Ancient town is located in Viet Nam\u2019s central Quang Nam Province, on the north bank near the mouth of the Thu Bon River. The inscribed property comprises 30 ha and it has a buffer zone of 280 ha. It \u00a0is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a small-scale trading port active the 15th to 19th centuries\u00a0 which traded widely, both with the countries of Southeast and East Asia and with the rest of the world. Its decline in the later 19th century ensured that it has retained its traditional urban tissue to a remarkable degree.\nThe town reflects a fusion of indigenous and foreign cultures (principally Chinese and Japanese with later European influences) that combined to produce this unique survival.\nThe town comprises a well-preserved complex of 1,107 timber frame buildings, with brick or wooden walls, which include architectural monuments, commercial and domestic vernacular structures, notably an open market and a ferry quay, and religious buildings such as pagodas and family cult houses. The houses are tiled and the wooden components are carved with traditional motifs.\u00a0 They are arranged side-by-side in tight, unbroken rows along narrow pedestrian streets. There is also the fine wooden Japanese bridge, with a pagoda on it, dating from the 18th century. The original street plan, which developed as the town became a port, remains. It comprises a grid of streets with one axis parallel to the river and the other axis of streets and alleys set at right angles to it. Typically, the buildings front the streets for convenient customer access while the backs of the buildings open to the river allowing easy loading and off-loading of goods from boats.\nThe surviving wooden structures and street plan are original and intact and together present a traditional townscape of the 17th and 18th centuries, the survival of which is unique in the region. The town continues to this day to be occupied and function as a trading port and centre of commerce. The living heritage reflecting the diverse communities of the indigenous inhabitants of the town, as well as foreigners, has also been preserved and continues to be passed on. Hoi An Ancient Town remains an exceptionally well-preserved example of a Far Eastern port.\nCriterion (ii): Hoi An is an outstanding material manifestation of the fusion of cultures over time in an international commercial port.\nCriterion (v): Hoi An is an exceptionally well-preserved example of a traditional Asian trading port.\nIntegrity\nHoi An Ancient Town has retained its original form and function as an outstanding example of a well-preserved traditional South East Asian trading port and commercial centre. It remains complete as a homogenous complex of traditional wooden buildings, with the original organically developed street plan, within the town\u2019s original river/seacoast setting.\nThese original cultural and historic features demonstrate the town\u2019s outstanding universal value and are present, well-preserved, and evident within the boundary of the inscribed property, even while it continues to be occupied and function as a trading port, as well as a popular tourism destination. As a result of this economic stagnation since the 19th century, it has not suffered from development and there has not been pressure to replace the older wooden buildings with new ones in modern materials. This has ensured that the town has retained its traditional urban tissue and is preserved in a remarkably intact state.\nAuthenticity\nHoi An Ancient Town has retained its traditional wooden architecture and townscape in terms of plot size, materials, fa\u00e7ade and roof line. Its original street plan, with buildings backing on to the river, with its infrastructure of quays, canals and bridges in its original setting, also remains. The historic landscape setting is also intact, consisting of a coastal environment of river, seashore, dunes and islands.\nBecause most of the buildings were constructed in wood it is necessary for them to be repaired at intervals, and so many buildings with basic structures from the 17th and 18th centuries were renewed in the 19th century, using traditional methods of repair. There is currently no pressure to replace older buildings with new ones in modern materials such as concrete and corrugated iron.\nProtection and management requirements\nHoi An Ancient Town was classified as a National Cultural Heritage Site in 1985 and subsequently as a Special National Cultural Heritage Site under the Cultural Heritage Law of 2001 amended in 2009. The entire town is State property and is effectively protected by a number of relevant national laws and governmental decisions, such as: the Cultural Heritage Law (2001, amended 2009) and the Tourism Law (2005). The 1997 Hoi An Town Statute defines in regulations that are implemented by the Hoi An Center for Monuments Management and Preservation, the responsible agency of the People\u2019s Committee for the management of the property. Day-to-day management involves collaboration with various stakeholders, to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the property and to monitor socio-economic activities within and adjacent to the property. The capacity of the professional staff has been and continues to be developed by many domestic and international training courses. Revenue from entrance tickets is invested directly in the management, preservation and promotion of the property. Management and preservation are further strengthened through master planning and action plans at the local level. There are also regular restoration and conservation programmes.\nMulti-disciplinary research conducted by teams of international and national scholars has informed the conservation and interpretation of the town\u2019s heritage. This research is on-going. Within the property boundary, the landscape, the townscape, the architecture and all material cultural artifacts are preserved.\nA Management Plan was implemented at the time of nomination of the property, and is being kept up to date and reviewed as required by UNESCO to ensure that it remains effective.\nThe buffer zone is managed to protect the property from external threats. The potential adverse effects to the property caused by annual flooding and urbanization are being effectively controlled with the active participation of all authorities and the local community.\nThe Master Plan for the Hoi An Ancient town conservation, restoration and promotion together with the city and tourism development was approved by Prime Minister on 12 January 2012, covered the period until 2025.\nLong-term management should aim to promote improvement in the living conditions for local residents. As tourism increases a strategy to manage it within the parameters of the site will be required. Strategies to deal with adverse effects of the climate are being developed and should be included in the Management Plan.\nIn the future, it is an aim to link the Hoi An Ancient Town with the adjacent UNESCO Cu Lao Cham Biosphere Reserve and to build Hoi An into a community integrating ecology, culture and tourism.\nMedia\nNews\n(1)\nDate of Inscription: 1999\nRef: 948\nWeb Browser not supported for ESRI ArcGIS API version 4.10.

            "June 16, 2017\nA view of Cambodia's famous Angkor Wat temple is seen during sunrise in Siem Reap.\nShare\nshare\n0:00 0:08:24\nPop-out player\nThe travel website TripAdvisor has named Cambodia\u2019s ancient Angkor Wat as the top landmark in the world.\nThe website uses travelers\u2019 reviews to choose winners each year. Angkor Wat received 33,000 five-star reviews in the last 12 months.\nIt also topped TripAdvisor\u2019s list of landmarks in 2015.\nAngkor Wat is the world\u2019s largest religious monument. It includes temples, reservoirs and canals. The website World Archaeology describes Angkor Wat as \u201cthe most extensive urban complex in the pre-industrial world.\u201d\nCambodia's famed Angkor Wat ancient Hindu temple complex stands in Siem Reap province, some 230 kilometers (143 miles) northwest Phnom Penh, Cambodia, June 28, 2012.\nBuilt between 802 and 1431, the city of Angkor was the center of the Khmer rule in what is now Cambodia. Power struggles, foreign invasion and climate change led to the Khmer rule\u2019s downfall.\nLast year, 2.2 million tourists visited Angkor Wat.\nTripAdvisor reviews call it \u201cmajestic\u201d and \u201clike absolutely nothing else I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nHere are a few other landmarks that made TripAdvisor\u2019s top 25 list:\nSheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center\nJust after Angkor Wat on the list is the United Arab Emirates\u2019 Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center.\nTourists take photographs at the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell)\nThe Center in Abu Dhabi is considered one of the UAE\u2019s most important - and beautiful - places of worship. With minarets, reflecting pools and gold details, the mosque is extraordinary both inside and outside.\nThe mosque is named for the first president of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. It was built between 1996 and 2007.\nChurch of the Savior of Spilled Blood\nThe one Russian landmark to make the list is St. Petersburg\u2019s Church of the Savior of Spilled Blood. It came in at number 6.\nThe Savior of Spilled Blood Cathedral is seen in St.Petersburg, Russia, Monday, July 29, 2013, with the Griboyedov canal at right. (AP Photo/Dmitry Lovetsky)\nThe Russian-style church is colorful and detailed. One TripAdvisor user wrote, \u201cthe whole church is a piece of art\u2026.with mosaics covering every inch.\u201d\nThe church was built on the place where revolutionaries killed Emperor Alexander II in 1881. That is where the church\u2019s name comes from.\nConstruction on the church began two years after Alexander\u2019s murder. It was completed in 1907. The church fell into disrepair during the Russian Revolution in 1917, and later during World War II. Repair efforts began in the 1970s. It opened to the public 27 years later.\nGreat Wall of China at Mutianyu\nComing in at number 7 on TripAdvisor\u2019s list is China\u2019s Great Wall at Mutianyu.\nMiss World contestants Kamilla Salgado of Brazil, right, and Tang Xiao of China take a photo of themselves while visiting the Mutianyu Great Wall in Beijing, China Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2010.\nThe Great Wall once stretched for more than 13,000 kilometers. About 8,000 kilometers still stand today.\nMutianyu is among the best-kept parts of the wall. It was first built in the middle 500s. It is the Great Wall\u2019s longest restored part open to visitors.\nMutianyu is about 60 kilometers from Beijing. It has 23 watchtowers, and is surrounded by forests and little waterways. While many tourists visit this historic place each day, it still receives fewer visitors than some other parts close to Beijing, like the famous Badaling area.\nGolden Gate Bridge\nThe highest-rated U.S. landmark on TripAdvisor\u2019s list is the Golden Gate Bridge. It came in at number 11.\nJeunne Victorino, visiting from San Diego, photographs the sunrise and the Golden Gate Bridge from the Marin Headlands Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2017, in San Francisco. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)\nThe famous structure stretches 2,788 meters. It opened to traffic on May 27, 1937. It is one of the world\u2019s most impressive engineering successes. More than 110,000 cars travel across the Golden Gate Bridge everyday.\nIt is named after the waterway it crosses; the Golden Gate Strait flows between the Pacific Ocean and the San Francisco Bay. The bridge links the city of San Francisco with Marin County.\nEl Ateneo Grand Splendid\nFor our final landmark today, we head to South America. Coming in at number 20 is Argentina\u2019s book-filled El Ateneo Grand Splendid.\nCustomers walk around the El Ateneo Grand Splendid bookstore located in a former theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nWhen it first opened in Buenos Aires in 1919, the Grand Splendid was a performing arts theater. Some of Argentina\u2019s most famous tango dancers performed there. Later, it became a movie theater.\nReminders of its past still remain, including red stage curtains, painted ceilings and theater boxes. But instead of rows of chairs where the audience one sat, there are now rows of bookshelves. The theater boxes are now small reading rooms. And the stage has been turned into a cafe.\nGrand Splendid became a bookstore in 2000. At the time, city officials were considering tearing down the historic building. Today, it is one of the best-known bookstores in the world.\nI\u2019m Ashley Thompson.\nAnd I'm Caty Weaver.\nHave you been to any of TripAdvisor's top 25 world landmarks?

            "What Landmarks You Shouldn\u2019t Miss on a Trip to Cambodia?\nCambodia, located in Southeast Asia, has many impressive landmarks. And you can see most of them in Phnom Penh and the Angkor Archaeological Park, near Siem Reap. Still, fascinating monuments and structures are available everywhere. And they highlight the country's historical relation to Buddhism, Hinduism and the mighty Khmer Empire. For such a small country, Cambodia has a huge cultural legacy. And now we are going to see what landmarks you shouldn't miss on a trip to Cambodia.\nFor more information about Cambodia tour , please click and and check the content.\nBest Landmarks of the Angkor Archaeological Park\nFamous Angkor Wat occupies the central position on an island surrounded by a moat. This magnificent and overwhelming Cambodian landmark is the world's largest religious complex. Its surface is 2 km2 (0.77 mi2), while the height of the temple is 213 meters (almost 700 feet). The highest structure of the Angkor Wat assumes the center of the complex. The outlying level is the widest and the lowest. The temple symbolizes Mount Meru, the center of the Hindu cosmology and mythology. The surrounding moat is there for oceans that encircle the Hindu universe. Walls represent surrounding mountains, with the 5 dominating towers standing for the Mount Meru's 5 peaks.\nAngkor Wat\nOnce you cross over the bridge and go past walls, an interesting Hindu world welcomes you. Bas-reliefs and other works of art convey stories of the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics. Among other protagonists, you will recognize Hindu gods, divine dancers and mythological creatures. Naga is a half human, half snake creature and the guardian of the underworld in the Hindu mythology. Garuda, half human, half bird, is Naga\u2019s merciless foe.\nBayon is a shining jewel of the nearby Angkor Thom, which used to be the capital of the Khmer Empire. Unlike the Angkor Wat, this landmark used to be the Buddhist structure. The interesting fact is that Khmer emperors were inclined toward altering the official religion. And that's why this incredible Cambodian landmark features Hindu besides Buddhist motifs. The Bayon stands in the very center of the Angkor Thom. Thus, it marks the intersection of the heaven and the earth. The temple consists of 3 compounds, with thousands of carvings decorating their walls. A big share of those features a soft, enigmatic smile. No wonder why the nickname of this incredible monument to Cambodia's imperial past is the \"Mona Lisa of Southeast Asia.\u201d Works of art represent Buddha and the Hindu mythology. Yet, certain carvings depict historic events, too.\nBayon\nBanteay Srei is another perfect example of the Khmer art. Located some 25 km/15 mi from the Angkor Wat, it is one of the finest landmarks of Cambodia. Because of the high level of the intricacy of its artwork, the Banteay Srei is also known as \"the Citadel of the Women.\" The site features 4 enclosures made of red sandstone. Its galleries and walls illustrate events from Ramayana and Mahabharata.\nBanteay Srei\nThe very finest carvings of the Angkor Archaeological Park give this place a big credit. And they illustrate Hindu deities, heavenly beings, monsters and other creatures. In the second enclosure, take note of the depiction of Ravana. The demon unsuccessfully attempts to lift the Mount Kailash, held down by Shiva and Uma. Try to visit this gorgeous temple at sundown. Then, the glow of the red sandstone intensifies with the descending sun.\nTop Landmarks in Phnom Penh\nThe Royal Palace compound in Phnom Penh is a harmonious unity of elegant structures, gardens and styles. Besides Khmer architecture, you will recognize colonial elements imported by the French. In addition, you will notice Hindu and Buddhist symbols and scenes amid such an eclectic mix.\nThe Royal Palace\nThe Throne Hall is one of the most impressive landmarks of the Cambodian capital city. It features the classical Khmer architectural style. This 59-meter (193-feet) tall edifice safeguards traditional and modern thrones and exquisite decoration. Also examine illustrations of certain scenes from the Ramayana and busts of the Cambodian rulers.\nThe Napoleon III Pavilion is a fine example of the colonial style. The adjacent Damnak Chan Pavilion is a successful blend of the Khmer and European styles. Khmer roof tops the rest of the pavilion, presenting the colonial style.\nFind the Silver Pagoda next to the Royal Palace. It is a serene place with majestic gardens and a few incredible features. Note that the Silver Pagoda is a religious complex, even if you don't see the monks.\nSilver Pagoda\nThe largest mural in Southeast Asia is among the main Cambodian landmarks. Its depictions convey the scenes from the Ramayana epic. A large statue of Buddha made of emerald crystal is another highlight. The actual name of the complex is the Temple of Emerald Buddha, and the statue is credited for it. As for the Silver Pagoda nickname, it relates to the handmade silver tiles paving the floor. Finally, another rarity you can see here is the golden statue of Buddha dotted with diamonds.\nOther Top Landmarks of Cambodia\nBeng Mealea is a temple located approx. 60 km (37 mi) east of the Angkor Archaeological Park. Its style is similar to those of most other temples in the park. Yet, the Beng Mealea stands out thanks to the jungle that reclaimed the site. Due to the fact, you will have a strong impression of being in one of the adventure films.\nBeng Mealea\nBecause of the advancing vegetation, sections of the Beng Mealea are differently preserved. Overcoming heaps of fallen rocks is possible thanks to ramps used for filming once. While exploring the interior of the complex, you'll see Hindu- and Buddhist-inspired motifs. The artwork introduces the Trimurti, the supreme Hindu triumvirate. Besides Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, pay attention to scenes from Mahabharata and Ramayana. Churning of the Ocean of Milk is one of the highlights.\nThe road you used to reach the Beng Mealea leads to Koh Ker, the true lost city. Located around 130 km (80 mi) from Siem Reap, it used to be the Khmer capital before Angkor Thom took over. Now, lush vegetation competes against once gorgeous structures for supremacy. Koh Ker is best known for its two edifices that are the chief landmarks here.\nKoh Ker\nThe Prasat Thom is a sandstone structure 40 meters (131 feet) tall. Due to its receding terraces, it is reminiscent of the Mayan temples in Central America. The top of this imposing landmark dominates over the surrounding woods. And you can climb it via a staircase. Built of red brick, the Prasat Krahom is the second tallest landmark of Koh Ker. It is also known as the Red Temple. The structure is an entrance gate to one of the Prasat Thom's enclosures. It features various gates, carvings, ponds and much more.\nLocated 50 km (31 mi) south of Phnom Penh, the Phnom Chisor is the site of the Angkorian era. Occupying the top of a high vantage point, it is also famous as the Chisor Mountain. Verdant greenery surrounds the site. But, you will be able to see rice fields in the surrounding area.\nPhnom Chisor\nMain landmarks of the Phnom Chisor are the main temple and a few sanctuaries. Half-preserved walls and two galleries, one of which is 60 meters (197 feet) long, are other notable features. The fact that the royals climbed this site during rituals make the Phnom Chisor one of the top landmarks you should visit on a trip to Cambodia.\nMore Articles about Cambodia Tour Guide\nSiem Reap\nThe 3-day tour will cover the highlights of Siem Reap Cambodia, so you can enjoy the excotic charm and the unique scenery of Cambodia ...\nSiem Reap-Phnom Penh\nThis 5 days tour includes the best of Siem Reap, which is a best way to discover the real Cambodia life and culture.

While the city boasts several worth visiting shopping malls \u2013 from the vintage-styled trendy Hatten Square Suites Shoppes to the biggest Dataran Pahlawan Melaka Megamall, the absolute must-go is the world famous Jonker Street flanked with centuries old galleries and museums and offering an incredible collection of local items to suit all tastes.\nShopping in Malaysia\nAs with the rest of Southeast Asia (SEA), you need to bargain in the markets to get a good price. But, only try your haggling skills in markets without fixed prices. Any shopping malls, supermarkets, restaurants, food courts and smaller shops with a price is what you pay. Just remember that if you get a receipt, you can\u2019t ask for a lower price.\nSo, what\u2019s the art of bargaining in Malaysia? Most of the vendors will be Chinese Malaysians who sell a range of products, clothes and trinkets. If you\u2019re in a market with lots of other foreign tourists, expect the quoted price to be higher. When you ask how much, the vendor often gives an amount that\u2019s usually double the actual rate or higher. Make sure you know what the price range for that particular item is before you bargain.\nOther tips include showing shock when they give the price and come back with an exaggerated \u2018mahal\u2019, which means expensive in Bahasa Malaysia. Always smile and be willing to walk away in most places and never ask for change if you give a large denomination note because you won\u2019t get it! There are plenty of bargains in Malaysia especially if you buy in bulk. But as a foreigner, you\u2019ll always pay more than a local.\nA word of warning. People wanting to bargain on Petaling Street in Kuala Lumpur should be very careful. The Chinese merchants who engage in negotiations expect to make a sale at the end, and they get angry with those who don\u2019t for wasting their time. If you can\u2019t agree on a price and walk away, they\u2019re likely to shout at you. So, if you\u2019re in Petaling Street, only bargain if you want to buy it!\nThe best things to buy in Malaysia to take home\nShopping in Malaysia\nThe abundance of shopping in Malaysia gives tourists the opportunity to bring home any number of souvenirs to keep the memory of their trip alive. Here are 15 unique things you can buy in Malaysia to make that perfect gift or souvenir.\n1. Batik\nBatik is a type of fabric made from silk and often used to create shirts and accessories. The high-quality material has elaborate, intricate and multicoloured patterns making an ideal gift for anyone who likes arts and crafts. Batik is famous in both Malaysia and Indonesia with each region creating their own styles and patterns. The price of Batik varies depending on quality from RM 40 ($9.60) up to RM 100+ ($24).\n2. Sarong\nA sarong is a versatile cloth both men and women wear in Malaysia. Each has its own patterns and styles and can be bought for as little as RM 20 ($4.80). Sarongs are extremely adaptable, and you can use them in a range of situations both in Malaysia and back home.\n3. Hand-woven gifts\nBamboo is ubiquitous in SEA and strips are sometimes woven into handicraft such as baskets, ornaments and souvenirs. You should be able to find these on sale in touristy areas or local handicraft shops.\n4. Tropical fruit chocolate\nIf you\u2019re a fan of chocolate and love tropical fruit, try tropical fruit chocolate. Flavours include the notorious durian as well as jackfruit and many others. You may not be able to bring the fruit back with you, but you can in the form of chocolate!\n5. Songket\nA Songket is a type of fabric unique to Malaysia consisting of multi-coloured threads interwoven into patterns similar to batik. The material itself can be used to make clothes and accessories or hang on your wall as a decoration. Songket represents the fusion of Chinese, Malaysian and India cultures.\n6. Cucuk Sanggul\nFor a more traditional souvenir, buy a cucuk Sanggul. Sanggul means to put your hair in a bun. Cucuk Sanggul are hairpins made from either silver or gold with a decorative end. Some have patterns; others have images of animals and mythical creatures. The price ranges from at least RM 100 up to RM 300 ($22 to $74) and higher depending on material quality. You may need to go to a specialist shop to buy one.\n7. Tropical art\nSome of the local handicraft and art shops have a selection of hand-drawn pictures and paintings of a tropical environment. Many have vibrant colours and will look perfect hanging in your front room. The art often depicts palm tree, banana leaves and houses on stilts especially in a 'kampung' (countryside) setting.\n8. Instant noodles\nThe shelves in the supermarkets and convenience stores are full of instant noodles. Most are unique to Asia and may not be available back home. If you like noodles, buy some Malaysian ones and bring them back home. A pack of five local instant noodles should cost no more than RM 6 (less than $2), which is much cheaper than many other countries.\n9. Rice wine\nMalaysia may not be flooded with alcohol like other SEA countries. But some of the indigenous communities in Sabah and Sarawak brew a special type of liquor called rice wine. As the name suggests, rice is fermented and distilled into a drink that shares similarities with vodka. You\u2019re unlikely to find this in Western Malaysia, though it\u2019s available in Sabah and Sarawak. If you know the right place, you can get a 1-litre bottle of rice wine for as little as RM 10 to 20 ($2.40 to $4.80).\n10. Clothes and shoes\nAnyone who lives in the west knows how expensive shopping can be. And those in Asia often experience being unable to find clothes or shoes that fit. Malaysia combines the best of both. Casual t-shirts may set you back RM 20 ($4.80), and a pair of decent shoes shouldn\u2019t be more than RM 100 ($24).\n11. Dodol\nDodol is a sticky toffee-like sweet with a soft texture often eaten as a dessert. You can find a range of flavours including some with tropical fruits such as durian. Shops often sell dodol in a prepacked box in the same way as confectionary. Depending on where you buy it from, expect anything between RM 15 ($3.60) and RM 30 ($7.20) for a large box. But beware of buying in the touristy areas; the price can be almost double. If you\u2019re in Malaysia around major festivals, you may be able to find a better deal.\n12. Sabah Pearls\nPearling was a major industry in Sabah in a bygone era. Divers without sophisticated equipment dove to the shallow depths of the South China Sea to make a living. Today, speciality shops sell pearls as ornaments and jewellery such as necklaces and earrings. Prices start from RM 100 ($24) to several thousands of ringgits depending on the quality and rarity of the pearl. However, buying in Sabah is often significantly less expensive than elsewhere. Shop around as the price and quality varies considerably.\n13. Sabah Tea\nShopping in Malaysia\nTea drinkers will love the locally-produced oraganic Sabah Tea which you can find in Sabah and West Malaysia. The tea plantation in Ranau, a small town a few hours from Kota Kinabalu, harvest the preservative-free leaves by hand. Tours are available for those who are interested to visit and learn about the process. Some say the tea has health benefits too. Expect to pay at least RM 5 ($1.20) for 200 grams box of loose tea or around RM 10 for a box 20 tea bags. Be sure to order a cup to sample the tea before buying a few boxes to take home.\n14. Spices\nWhen walking through the streets of any town or city in Malaysia you\u2019ll notice the multiculturalism and mixture of different races and ethnicities. Each group has their own style of cooking that uses various spices like saffron, paprika, curry powder, turmeric among other types in their food. Spices are on sale at very reasonable prices in markets or speciality shops around the country, especially in Kuala Lumpur. When you\u2019re at the restaurant, ask the waiter or chef what they use and try to buy some to bring back home. Having the right spices allows you to replicate and cook some of the delicious food yourself.\n15. Old Town Instant White Coffee\nWhen you\u2019re in Malaysia, you\u2019re likely to drink some Old Town coffee. Old Town has a strong flavour with a texture that\u2019s both milky and smooth to drink. Tourists tend to fall in love with the coffee. A big packet of instant coffee with 15 sachets in the local supermarkets cost around RM 15 ($4) allowing you to have your favourite drink when you get back home.\nThe five best shopping centres in Malaysia\nShopping in Malaysia\nIf you\u2019re travelling for the Malaysian to fill your suitcase or just soak up the shopping experience, check out the malls first. Here are five of the best in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Langkawi and Sabah for high-quality products at affordable prices.\n1. Suria KLCC, Kuala Lumpur\nSuria KLCC is a high-end shopping mall in the golden triangle of Kuala Lumpur and a major stop on LRT (Light Railway Transit) from KL Sentral. Shops include Marks & Spencer\u2019s, Michael Kors, Tiffany & Co, and Versace. The mall usually attracts customers from the Middle East especially for the Christmas and end of year sales. You can also take a stroll in the park outside the mall to get excellent photographs of the fountains and Kuala Lumpur\u2019s iconic Petronas Twin Towers. New shops selling international brands open all the time in this prestigious mall.\n2. Nu Sentral, Kuala Lumpur\nNu Sentral is part of Kuala Lumpur Sentral Station. This newly built mall is aimed towards average shoppers and locals with more budget-friendly prices. Shops include Parkson, Brands Outlet, Factory Outlet Store and a grocery store. Electronics stores have smartphones, tablets and brands such as Vivo, Oppo and Apple. This shopping centre is a great place to shop if you're staying in Brickfields area. Several restaurants are inside Nu Sentral too.\n3. Teow Soon Huat Duty-Free, Langkawi\nLangkawi has a reputation for duty-free shopping among both domestic and international tourists. And there\u2019s no better place on the island than at Teow Soon Huat inside Langkawi Parade Megamall. You can find everything from tax-free liquor and cigarettes to a range of confectionary and perfumes at up to 70% off the retail price elsewhere in Malaysia. If you\u2019re visiting Langkawi, check out the mall even if you don\u2019t plan to buy anything as you may stumble on the deal of a lifetime.\n4. Gurney Paragon Mall, Penang\nGurney is the main shopping centre in Penang\u2019s capital, Georgetown where the locals and tourists like to hang out and indulge in retail therapy. Shops sell clothes at big discounts as well as named brands, jewellery and electronics. The mall itself is inside an expensive residential block and has restaurants, a movie theatre and beautiful views of the esplanade.\n5. Suria Sabah, Kota Kinabalu\nKota Kinabalu, Sabah\u2019s capital, has a large shopping mall in the city centre overlooking the South China Sea. You can find a bookstore, supermarkets and a cinema inside. Shops sell popular brands such as Adidas, Nike and some budget outlets like Factory Outlet Store and Brands Outlet. There\u2019s also a food court and a sky bar with an excellent view of the sea.\nConclusion\nMalaysia is an excellent place for shopping in SEA where tourists can get clothes, shoes and other goods at a fraction of the price back at home. Whether you want a new wardrobe or a cool memento for a unique souvenir, you\u2019ll find it in Malaysia.\n2012\u20142020 \u00a9 12Go Asia Pte., Ltd. Version 290.496\n"

            "Story Saved\nTo revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories .\nClose Alert\nThis Ukrainian Artist Is Recycling \u201990s Flip Phones for Her One-of-a-Kind Fashion Accessories\nHanne Zaruma is no ordinary tech nerd. Rather than coveting the latest iPhone, the Ukrainian artist sees beauty in the gadgets of yesteryear, fastidiously scouring secondhand stores and yard sales in Lviv, her hometown, for retro computers and discarded flip phones. \u201cI make all of my work from used stuff that everyone has forgotten about,\u201d says Zaruma, who uses these found objects to embellish vintage shoes and handbags. \u201cI am trying to give it a new life.\u201d\nZaruma\u2019s Instagram page is filled with these curious technological fashion creations. Think a shoulder bag affixed with the remnants of a Nokia phone, statement earrings made from shards of a motherboard , or shoes covered with the keys of an old computer fished out from the artist\u2019s storage closet. On her Instagram, she has posted videos of herself \u201ctyping\u201d on the computerized accessories with a nearby iPhone seemingly registering her words. (The video on the iPhone is actually prerecorded, a clever optical illusion.) \u201cWith my work I want to show that it is not necessary to have money to make art,\u201d says Zaruma, 21, who enlists friends and family to model as well as orchestrating her own selfies.\nA law student by day, the artist began experimenting with her quirky designs about a year ago while living between Ukraine and China and working as a model. Rather surprisingly, one of the first pieces to ignite interest on Instagram was actually inspired by the natural world: a pair of jeans covered entirely in autumnal leaves .\nThough equally as conceptual, her latest works have proven to be more future-thinking and include sunglasses partially fashioned from an iPhone screen that  displays an image of a human eye. \u201cA human face is interesting, it\u2019s already a piece of art,\u201d she says. \u201cThe message of my work is to allow viewers to see some magic in the ordinary\u2014and also to make them smile.\u201d\nVogue Daily\nThe best new culture, style, and beauty stories from Vogue, delivered to you daily.\nSign Up Now\nThe latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nVogue may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

            "From the stone-cold classic to the low-key underrated to the\u2026well, less-than-GOAT, we're ranking the greatest basketball sneaker line in history.\nThere are a lot of things we could say here about Air Jordans , many of which you\u2019ve probably heard before. We could talk about their mystique: how they birthed sneaker culture as we know it; how they irrevocably altered the worlds of sports and fashion and marketing; how no other signature line\u2014despite our current cover guy \u2019s claims otherwise \u2014has ever matched their exact formula of technical innovation and beautiful design and cultural prominence. Or we could talk about the little things, like the irrational confidence you feel lacing them up on the blacktop; or how good Frank Ocean looked in Royal 1s at Paris Fashion Week that one time; or how intoxicating a fresh pair smells right out of the box, like Windex and freshly ground pepper.\nInstead, we\u2019re going to say something perhaps a little obvious: that like all collections of great things (movie franchises, Philip Roth novels, Tyler, the Creator fits) there are hits, misses, and plenty of weird things in between. Which means they\u2019re ripe for a ranking\u2014one both arbitrary and definitive.\nAnd so, with The Last Dance premiering tomorrow night on ESPN, we took this opportunity to re-assess all 34 Air Jordans. The good, the bad, the great, and, especially, the completely wacky\u2014of which there are many. We judged them based on their looks, their on-court performance, and their pop cultural footprint, with a healthy dose of personal nostalgia mixed in for good measure. We look forward to you judging us back in our Twitter mentions. \u2014Yang-Yi Goh\n1. Air Jordan III\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThis is it, folks. This is the one. The sneaker that catapulted the Air Jordan from just another signature line to a pop cultural phenomenon worth mythologizing, lining up for, debating over, and writing lists like this one about. The Is began writing the story, the IIs removed the Swoosh from the sides, but the III is where everything that truly makes a J a J comes into play. It\u2019s the first Jordan designed by Tinker Hatfield, the visionary who pioneered the exposed Air bubble, dreamt up Marty McFly\u2019s self-lacing bangers, and blessed us with eight of the top 10 sneakers below. And it\u2019s the first Jordan to feature the Jumpman, the only corporate logo to inspire both a life-sized bronze statue and an inescapable earworm of a Drake and Future song . The design itself somehow feels retro and futuristic and totally timeless all at once, and the OG colorways gave us the elephant print that\u2019s become a HOF-worthy sneaker culture staple. Add in the classic Mars Blackmon commercials that helped turn Jordan into the most marketable athlete alive, plus the fact that these are reportedly Mike\u2019s favorite Js ever, and you\u2019ve got yourself a clear number-one on a listful of legends. \u2014Yang-Yi Goh\n2. Air Jordan I\nCourtesy of Jordan\nLook at it! I mean, look at it. This is the future\u2014of basketball, of sneakers, of style, of Nike, of MJ\u2014in a single high-top sneaker. This is the black-and-red colorway that the NBA deemed illegal, leading Nike to pay Jordan\u2019s fines, literally every sneaker to follow to drop in its own \u201cbred\u201d iteration, and, really, sneakers to turn into vectors of personal style. Its popularity has fluctuated over the years, but ever since a guy from Chicago named Kanye West started wearing them, they catapulted to the top of the Jordan list. It\u2019s not likely they\u2019ll go anywhere soon. \u2014Sam Schube\n3. Air Jordan XI\nNathaniel S. Butler\nCourtesy of Jordan\nMJ hit his pinnacle as an athlete during the \u201890s, and the pinnacle of his sneaker line during that decade\u2014without question\u2014is the Air Jordan XI. Like all great Js, the XI is a seamless marriage of neck-snapping style and elite performance. Even now, that gleaming, tuxedo-aping patent leather is astonishing enough to elicit goosebumps from me, a grown man who has stared at these sneakers thousands of times over the past 25 years. And in 1995, people looked at these things like they\u2019d just crash landed from another galaxy. The real brilliance of the patent mudguard, though, is that it wasn\u2019t just there for the shine: because it\u2019s lighter and less stretchy than full-grain leather, it resulted in a more explosive shoe that held your feet snugly in place. Outside of the Is, the XI is the Air Jordan people are still most likely to camp out overnight to cop: a 2011 retro of the Concord\u2014a colorway so perfect that Jordan wore it for the entire \u201895-96 regular season\u2014incited actual riots outside malls across the nation. Part of that lasting appeal is also due to the fact that it\u2019s the shoe Mike had on in Space Jam, cementing them in the imaginations of an entire generation of kids forever. \u2014Y.G.\n4. Air Jordan IV\nCourtesy of Jordan\n\u201cYo man, your Jordans are fucked up!\u201d By 1989, Air Jordans had become so ingrained in the culture\u2014a shorthand for excellence\u2014that they could anchor a pivotal scene in one of the best movies of the decade. As Jordan\u2019s high-flying antics started to turn heads overseas, the IV became the first Js to get a global release, coinciding with Tinker Hatfield really coming into his own and flexing his muscles: experimenting with mesh and molded plastics, and using nubuck leather on a basketball shoe for the very first time. Outside of its Do the Right Thing cameo, the IV\u2019s earned their place in history when MJ hit The Shot in them, meaning you\u2019d do well to steer clear of rocking these anywhere in Ohio. \u2014Y.G.\n5. Air Jordan VII\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nVisually, the VIIs are nearly identical to the VIs: same geometric panelling on the uppers, same jagged edges along the midsole. So why is it ranked a full four spots higher than its predecessor? For one thing, it\u2019s because of what\u2019s not there: this was the first Air Jordan to be released under the Jordan Brand moniker rather than Nike, which meant no Air bubble (a staple of Js from III through VI) and no Swooshes of any kind inside or out. That\u2019s a critical juncture for Michael Jordan, the businessman. Oh, yeah, and Michael Jordan, the basketball player? That guy had a pretty good year in these, too: he picked up his second ring, repeated as MVP and Finals MVP, and then became the talk of the Barcelona Olympics\u2014and the world\u2014with the original Dream Team. \u2014Y.G.\n6. Air Jordan XII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nFollowing up the showstopping XIs was no easy task, but Tinker managed it by adjusting the dials on looks (swapping out the flashy patent for subtle pebbled leather and cascading quilted panels) and performance (the XII is still considered one of the finest, most durable on-court Js ever). Factor in the indelible moments on its resume\u2014perhaps you\u2019ve heard of the Flu Game?\u2014and you\u2019ve got another instant classic from the line\u2019s hitmaking heyday. \u2014Y.G.\n7. Air Jordan V\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThanks to Will Smith and a little show called The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, these might be the first shoes you picture when you close your eyes and think \u201cAir Jordan.\u201d The V carried over a couple of elements from the IV\u2014namely, the plastic mesh on the quarter and the mix of nubuck and smooth leather\u2014and supercharged them with a confluence of aggressive lines inspired by WWII-era fighter planes. (This kicked off a recurring theme of Js taking cues from famous vehicles.) On the court, Jordan delivered his career-high in points wearing these fellas, hanging a cool 69 on the Cavs. \u2014Y.G.\n8. Air Jordan II\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThere\u2019s maybe no Jordan more criminally underrated by sneakerheads than the II, probably because it arrived wedged between the two icons at the very top of this list. But don\u2019t get it twisted: this was no sophomore slump. Long before NBA stars were style gods , or streetwear scions were calling the shots at age-old European houses , or anyone had even considered the idea of wearing sneakers with a suit, the Air Jordan II attempted to bridge the worlds of sportswear and high fashion. It did so by minimizing the Nike branding, wrapping its understated silhouette in luxe materials\u2014a swath of faux lizard skin and brogue-ish perforations around the toe box\u2014and crafting the whole thing in Italy for an extra air of sophistication (pre-dating Common Projects and its many copycats by almost two decades). \u2014Y.G.\n9. Air Jordan VI\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nSupposedly, Tinker Hatfield was inspired by Jordan\u2019s Porsche 911 while designing the VI. Which seems...wrong, because the 911 is sleek and bulbous and a paragon of timeless design, and the Air Jordan VI is all hard angles, a Frankensteined mishmash of materials, and an unmistakable product of its era. Whatever its origins, it\u2019s a beautiful sneaker\u2014the model His Airness laced up to capture his first ring, and the first to introduce two technologies that would go on to be borrowed by countless future hoops shoes: a neoprene sleeve lining and a two-hole pull on the tongue for easier entry. \u2014Y.G.\n10. Air Jordan XIV\nNathaniel S. Butler\nCourtesy of Jordan\nWhen, five short weeks from now, Michael Jordan definitely doesn\u2019t push off Bryon Russell while bringing both the 1998 Finals and The Last Dance to a close, he\u2019ll be wearing these. That\u2019d be worth a high spot on this list alone, but the XIVs earn their place with a Ferrari-indebted design that looks fast even on this page. Those little dino claws up front, that tech-y tongue attachment, a logo badge that screams \u201cForza!\u201d: it\u2019d be harder to invent a shoe better for Jordan to speed into retirement wearing. \u2014S.S.\n11. Air Jordan XIII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThis was the shoe Jordan wore for long chunks of the 1997-1998 season\u2014his last one as a Bull, and the centerpiece of The Last Dance. By that point, Jordan was a global icon: McDonalds, or Xerox, or the Statue of Liberty, but a person. And the 13\u2014luxe, textured, vaguely organic\u2014is the shoe of a very wealthy basketball player. This thing looks like it weighs ten pounds and costs its weight in gold. \u2014S.S.\n12. Air Jordan XVI\nCourtesy of Jordan\nBizarrely, the XVI isn\u2019t the first Jordan to play with the idea of spats, those shoe coverings that haven\u2019t been seen since the 1940s. (That\u2019d be the XI.) But the XVI is the first to make those spats removable\u2014silly, maybe, but the latest, most notable step in the line\u2019s groundbreaking, unceasing interest in exploring what a basketball shoe could do and be. Spats? Why not! \u2014S.S.\n13. Air Jordan VIII\nNathaniel S. Butler\nCourtesy of Jordan\nEverything you need to know about the VIII is on its tongue: that, friends, is chenille. This is perhaps the most \u201890s shoe in the Air Jordan line, from the Haring-adjacent patch to the X straps to the wax-paper-cup-indebted teal-and-purple colorway. Think of this less as a fine-wine-aging J than a shot of tequila chased with blue Gatorade\u2014not refined, necessarily, but a pleasure all its own. \u2014S.S.\n14. Air Jordan XVIII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe very last dance: Jordan wore the XVIIIs to close out his career in Washington, D.C. A little odd a the time, they\u2019ve aged bizarrely well: nods to Jordan\u2019s love of very fast cars (that driving shoe heel!) and a vamp cover that looks like a goddamn loafer make this thing a real pair fit for a sendoff. \u2014S.S.\n15. Air Jordan XV\nCourtesy of Jordan\nAfter the 1997-98 season, Michael Jordan retired for the second time (then thought to be for good). For the 98-99 season, his shoes went weird. The line\u2019s first (but not last!) dip into the bizarre, the gothic, the Lovecraft-indebted, the XV nonetheless looks incredibly cool some 20 years on. Inspired by the X-15 fighter jet, the shoe looks more like a piece of postmodern architecture\u2014a very public example of sports and fashion grappling with the GOAT\u2019s absence. \u2014S.S.\n16. Air Jordan IX\nSporting News Archive\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe IX was released during Jordan\u2019s baseball-playing hiatus, and it shows: it\u2019s a little bulky, more like a baseball cleat than the sleek, visionary kicks he\u2019d worn on the hardwood. \u2014S.S.\n17. Air Jordan XVII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nJordan\u2019s first Wizards-era sneaker received mixed reviews upon launch\u2014partially owing to its then-unheard of price tag of $200\u2014but its clean-lined look has aged nicely. The single greatest thing about the XVII, though, is what it came in: a Jumpman-branded, Mission: Impossible-esque metal briefcase , complete with an oh-so-2002 CD-ROM. \u2014Y.G.\n18. Air Jordan XIX\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nBecause sometimes your shoe needs a...skirt? Face mask? Kevlar bomber jacket? Yet another instance of J\u2019s pushing sneaker design in both novel and technologically advanced ways, the XIX is the rare hoops shoe best described as \u201cmysterious.\u201d \u2014S.S.\n19. Air Jordan X\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe Air Jordan X suffers in stature among sneakerheads mostly due to poor timing. Because it was designed and released while MJ was still off cosplaying as an outfielder in the minor leagues, the X was intended as a tribute to Jordan\u2019s basketball years, with a list of his career highlights engraved down the soles. That quickly became obsolete when Jordan returned to the hardcourt wearing 45\u2014and even then, he only wore these for a handful of games before switching to a prototype of the XI during the 1995 Eastern Conference Semis. From a design standpoint, the X is sort of bland and innocuous, most notable for paving the way shape-wise for the far more beloved XIs and XIIs. \u2014Y.G.\n20. Air Jordan XX8\nJesse D. Garrabrant\nCourtesy of Jordan\nJordan Brand has always had a vexed relationship with players not named Michael Jordan. Jordan himself picked the brand\u2019s first endorsers; a generation of kids who grew up wondering why Derek Anderson got to wear Js got, in their lesson, an object lesson in crony capitalism. By 2012, though, the brand had found in Russell Westbrook an endorser capable of both the breathtaking athletic feats and the incredible obstinacy required of a true Jordan wearer. And Russell \u201cWhy Not?\u201d Westbrook was the perfect figurehead for the XX8s: a stripped-down drop-top racecar of a shoe, a midcalf stunner often done up in wacky prints. Known by pickup legends as among the best-performing Js of recent memory, these are a cult classic in a line lacking for them in recent years. \u2014S.S.\n21. Air Jordan XX3\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nAfter countless Jordans modeled after MJ\u2019s cars, it was nice to finally get one based on the GOAT\u2019s one true passion: golfing. I mean, just look at that fancy stitched argyle, and then tell me you don\u2019t want to crank out a few long balls at the range. Not mad at it, honestly! In truth, the XX3\u2014a notable release, given Jordan\u2019s jersey number\u2014was meant to be the most personal J ever: Jordan\u2019s thumbprint is embossed on the rear, his signature is etched on the toe, and that argyle we were admiring earlier is actually meant to invoke his DNA patterns. \u2014Y.G.\n22. Air Jordan XX\nCourtesy of Jordan\nYet another instance of novelty\u2014that floating ankle strap, and the crazy-embellished, history-of-MJ one at midfoot\u2014coexisting with real technical leaps forward. That midsole housed a next-level cushioning system, even if all anyone wanted to talk about was the laser etching. \u2014S.S.\n23. Air Jordan 2010\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThis is the Air Jordan with a hole in it. No further questions, your honor. \u2014S.S.\n24. Air Jordan XXXI\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThirty-one shoes in, the design minds at Jordan Brand officially ran out of ideas. So they started back at one\u2014literally, with this hypermodern flip on the Air Jordan 1. Points for trying, I guess. \u2014Y.G.\n25. Air Jordan XXXII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nSame logic as the XXXI: this is a high-performance, turbo version of the 2. [Shrugs.] \u2014Y.G.\n26. Air Jordan XX9\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe entirely woven uppers made this the lightest Air Jordan ever, and the designers used that novel construction to screen print graphics directly onto the shoes. Sometimes that worked out fine\u2014like this so-so nod to the Air Jordan III\u2019s iconic elephant print\u2014and sometimes it wound up looking like a knickknack you\u2019d buy at one of those stands in the mall where you get a mug with your baby photo on it made for your mom\u2019s birthday. \u2014Y.G.\n27. Air Jordan XXXIV\nLayne Murdoch Jr.\nCourtesy of Jordan\nSo close on this one, fellas. The XXXIV, the newest addition to the Jordan lineup, so very nearly nailed exactly what we\u2019d want, both looks- and performance-wise, from a hoops shoe in 2020. Unfortunately, that doggone hole in the middle of the outsole pushes it a little too far into something-Tom-Cruise-might-wear-in-Oblivion territory for us to really take it seriously. \u2014Y.G.\n28. Air Jordan XX2\nNathaniel S. Butler\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe XX2 had the great misfortune of being just one model number short of the XX3\u2014i.e. 23, His Airness\u2019s jersey number\u2014which, at the time, many sneakerheads were anxiously anticipating as a monumental moment for the line. As a result, it felt like the designers sort of looked past this one, too: it\u2019s a relatively plain and straightforward design, with some fighter jet-inspired detailing that makes it look fast. As in, \u201cthe faster we get this shoe out the door, the sooner we can get to the one you\u2019re all waiting for.\u201d \u2014Y.G.\n29. Air Jordan XXXIII\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe 33s take MJ\u2019s otherworldly leaping ability a bit too literally, resulting in a silhouette best described as \u201chigh-tech moonboot.\u201d The ditching of laces for a quick-pull system is laudable (late period Jordans are nothing if not elaborately, ostentatiously technical), but the result is somehow a few feet to the left of what we understand as an Air Jordan. \u2014S.S.\n30. Air Jordan XXI\nCourtesy of Jordan\nSome Jordans take inspiration from MJ\u2019s beloved world of racing: lines borrowed from sports cars, parts modeled after spoilers or shoes or helmets. The XXI, though, takes that borrowing a little too liberally. These just...look like a pair of legit racing shoes, the sort that pass as stylish footwear in certain European cities. Jordans are best when they interpret and interpolate\u2014less good when they look like something an F1 driver would wear to work. \u2014S.S.\n31. Air Jordan 2009\nJordan 2009Courtesy of Jordan\nYou know things are getting tough in JordanWorld when the designers start taking inspiration from\u2014and yes, this is correct\u2014\u201cdefense\u201d and \u201cfencing.\u201d Defense might win championships, but high scorers make great shoes. And this one just doesn\u2019t have it. (This is the 2009 and not the XX4 because the brand retired the number system with MJ\u2019s own XX3\u2014only to bring it back a few years later.) \u2014S.S.\n32. Air Jordan 2011\nAndrew D. Bernstein\nCourtesy of Jordan\nSensing a theme? The Jordans of the 2010s, while perhaps the best-performing shoes in the history of basketball, nonetheless suffer from a distinct lack of charisma. Maybe it\u2019s because the brand was lacking a true figurehead\u2014\u201cRay Allen PE\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly send me running to StockX\u2014or because the line\u2019s focus on tech came at the expense of looks. Either way: another tough one for the GOAT. \u2014S.S.\n33. Air Jordan XXX\nCourtesy of Jordan\nYou ever have a friend who, instead of celebrating their 30th birthday, just asks everyone to kind of ignore it, and maybe just hangs out at 29 for another year? Yeah, me neither. \u2014S.S.\n34. Air Jordan 2012\nCourtesy of Jordan\nThe official copy for the AJ 2012 explains that the shoe pulled inspiration from \u201csome of basketball\u2019s ancestors\u201d\u2014which is to say, not from the greatest player of all time. The intentions were good, but the results (\u201cwingtip-like shapes and perforations,\u201d anybody?) leave plenty to be desired. They can\u2019t all be great\u2014but thankfully, just about all of them are better than this. \u2014S.S.\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n"

            "Penang Water Sports\nYou would think that a tropical island would be surrounded by water sports but the reality on Penang\nIsland is more limited. Penang Island\u2019s south coast, reserved more for industrial development, is not conducive to water sports; the west coast is largely protected by the island\u2019s National Park; and, the east coast\u2019s busy shipping lane holds only pollution and danger. Which, really, only leaves the northern coast as the best shore to host aquatic entertainment.\nIs it any wonder that Penang Island has water sports dotted along its northern shore? Not really. What is surprising are the amount of complaints about the lack of them, or at least the ability to take part in them. The weather is congenial, the water warm, clean and safe\u2026 and the prices \u2013 as so often a consideration that has made Penang, if not Malaysia, popular in recent years \u2013 very reasonable.\nThe first port of call must be the Penang Water Sport Recreation Centre (Pusat Kegiatan Sukan Air (PKSA)). Located just beyond the Tanjung Bungah Floating Mosque, PKSA is a non-profit organization that aims to provide the people of Penang with an outlet for engaging in outdoor activities and enjoying Penang\u2019s natural marine environment. Kayaks can be rented by groups of up to ten people on walk-in and must be booked beforehand by groups of ten or more. However, as their most popular activity, available for just RM15 per person per hour, we recommend booking any way. The obvious destination, while standing on the beach and looking out to sea, is Pulau Tikus (the Island) \u2013 an hours round trip that provides a brilliant sea-view of the Tanjung Bungah beach and its ever developing skyline.\nIf you are looking for more of a workout, PKSA also offers Dragon Boat rental. The traditional Chinese rowing is, however, a demanding sport and as such should not be approached lightly. Unlike kayaking \u2013 which requires no more than two arms and a reasonable sense of balance \u2013 Dragon Boats are unruly beasts, unstable unless guided by professionals, uncomfortable and glide less easily through the water. A maximum of 20 people can rent a boat for RM200 per hour along with an instructor (RM100) and steersman (MR60), an important attendee as the boats cannot steer solely by oars. Lifeguards can be hired upon request. In addition, sailing and windsurfing lessons are also available upon request.\nAddress: Jalan Batu Ferringhi, 11200, Tanjung Bungah, Pulau Pinang\nOpening hours: Monday to Friday, 10:00am \u2013 12:30pm/2:30pm \u2013 6:00pm; Saturday and Sunday, 9:00am \u2013 12:30pm/2:00pm \u2013 6:00pm\nContact: +604-890-9373\nAs well as PKSA, the beaches in Tanjung Bungah and Batu Ferringhi both offer more touristy water sport activities. Cools Watersports in Tanjung Bungah and Ferringhi Sea Sports. Co in Batu Ferringhi are two such companies, not that the names really matter. Walking along the beach, it is easy enough to recognise a small shack advertising parasailing, jet skis and banana boats in each location. Geared mainly to tourists, these activities will come with a premium cost but can\u2019t be had anywhere else. Comparatively, they still fall far below the average prices for beach water sports around the world. For the most part, the coordinators and drivers are friendly and responsible, even if a tad boisterous, but what can you expect from guys filled with sea air and salt water as a standard requirement in a day-to-day job.\nEscape Water Park\nIt is also good to keep in mind that in Teluk Bahang, on the northwest corner of Penang Island, next door to Entopia, the newly opened ESCAPE Water Park offers dingy rides, plunge pools, drop slides and much more. While not offering water sports per se, the park is a welcome addition to Penang Island\u2019s family friendly activities.\nLastly, if you are looking to take water sports more seriously as an investment of time and money, why not join a club specifically designed for water sport activities. Windsurfing & Aquatic Sport, affiliated to the Chinese Swimming Club (CSC), has equipment catered for sailing, windsurfing, stand up paddleboard (SUP),\nkayaking and canoeing. A popular course is their introductory sailing and windsurfing course designed for complete beginners. For members of the CSC they charge RM60 per person and RM100 for non-members, not a huge amount of money for those eager to develop skills as well as having fun. Plus, lunch is included!\nAddress: 562, Jalan Tanjung Bungah, 11200 Tanjung Bungah, Penang\nContact: CSC: +604-899 0813\nCoach: Katherine +6012-543 9369\nHelp keep the FREE SHEET free by supporting our sponsors \u2026\nGet the Free Sheet delivered to your Inbox every week\nOnly one email a week \u2026 we promise!\nSign up\nThank you!\nRecent Posts\n"

            "/ 02:40\n/ 21:40\nFeatured articles\n19 Nov 2018 09:45 4186\n0\nSHARES\n00\nFrom snowboarding and snorkeling to bungee jumping and zorbing, Japan is a diverse geographical and cultural landscape offering travelers a wide variety of extreme sports options. Becoming more popular amongst adrenaline junkies, Japan is quickly becoming a destination for those seeking their next thrill.\nSometimes called shock tourism, extreme tourism is a unique pocket of the tourism industry, a niche area that generally includes travel to a dangerous or risky destination. These global destinations can range from rugged mountainous regions, vast canyons, dark and deep caves, and remote deserts. One thing that is in common with each destination, is that travelers not only visit these precarious locations, but they also engage in risky, sometimes dangerous activities while there. Recently, extreme tourism has been gaining momentum in the land of the rising sun \u2013 Japan.\nAs Japan prepares for the 2020 Olympics, tourism is booming exponentially. According to cnbc.com, \u201c[There is a] historic boom [in Japan] in the wake of the drive to draw some 20 million leisure visitors, timed to coincide with the planned Olympics in Tokyo\u201d. In the past year, Japan excitedly welcomed some 28.7 million tourists, a major increase from 10.4 seen previously in 2013. Beyond the obvious draw of the upcoming Olympics, there has also been a recent increase in extreme sports tourism in Japan. As The Telegraph Travel section notes, \u201cJapan is the 8th fastest growing travel destination for adventure, out of 20 destinations including Sierra Leone, Iceland and Vietnam\u201d.\nAt Tourist Japan , CEO and Founder Ben Julius has seen a recent influx of tourists arriving in Japan specifically interested in extreme sports and seeking a new adrenaline rush. \u201cBeyond the many tourist attractions, impressive culinary scene and deeply rooted traditions seen in Japan, there is an extensive array of options for those travelers seeking adventure in Japan\u201d, says Julius. He continues to say, \u201cThese travelers are interested in combining culture, nature and thrill-seeking action, a perfect combination and something easy to accomplish while traveling in Japan\u201d.\nFilled with natural beauty and splendor, Japan offers many national parks, nature reserves, forests, and mountains.\u00a0 According to Nellie Huang, adventure travel writer and social media expert of Wild Junket , \u201cThere are more travelers heading to Japan for surfing and skiing\u201d. Huang thinks Japan is considered a great destination specifically for winter skiing and as she notes, \u201cEspecially in the northern parts of Hokkaido they have some of the best ski pistes in the region\u201d. The diverse landscape is ideal for travelers seeking to find their adrenaline rush from the snowy, mountainous region of Hokkaido as Huang says, popular amongst skiers of all levels to the Tone River in the Minakami area which a well-known location for river rafting of all levels. In fact, Japan offers many rivers ideal not only for rafting but also kayaking and canyoning. Hiking, cycling, and paragliding are also popular activities for those seeking a rush of adventure while in Japan.\nOne of the most notable attractions for extreme thrill-seekers looking for their next conquest is a 62-meter skydiving jump found in Sarugakyo Onsen known to bring many visitors. Additionally, Japan also offers a 100-meter drop from Ryujin Gorge Suspension bridge which is found in the Nametoke Valley. Adrenaline junkies can also seek out the Forest Canyon which offers a thrilling 40-meter natural waterslide, a perfect outdoor playground for those interested in canyoning, abseiling and hiking amidst the beautiful natural surroundings creating an unforgettable experience.\nEven among locals, extreme sports and adventure are bringing people together to get the adrenaline pumping. Meetup groups can be found in Tokyo ranging from kiteboarding to mountain climbing, online communities have formed to help adventure seekers connect. Tourists can also use these meetup groups and online forums to find their next adventure while traveling in Japan and connect with the local extreme sports enthusiasts who know the best places to visit.\nBeyond the rapid growth amongst locals and tourists, extreme sports tourism has also gained force and popularity due to social media and the rise of extreme sports influencers. Instagram has thousands of accounts devoted to extreme sports travelers, with hundreds of thousands of followers living vicariously through daily photo posts and videos showcasing extreme activities and travelers pushing the boundaries, continually increasing the danger and the threshold of specific destinations and adventure. Part of the thrill for these influencers is capturing the latest jump, trick or thrill on camera, sometimes reaching dangerous heights or locations which is difficult to capture. Hashtags like #extremesports, #adrenaline, #adventure #gopro are seen on a global scale all over Instagram with over 800,000 tags. The hashtag #japan currently has 94,693,498 posts on Instagram attracting adventure seekers and those looking for their next extreme endeavor in Japan.\nFrom kiteboarding, flyboarding, and zorbing to paintball and tandem snowboarding, Japan had caught onto the trend and offers travelers and locals a wide variety of options. Using the natural terrain and landscape to its advantage, it is obvious to see why more and more extreme sports tourists are visiting this diverse country.\nTags:\nOther Organizations 20 April 2020 09:32 778\nHotels & Lodging 20 April 2020 09:12 1095\nAviation 20 April 2020 08:22 931\nStatistics & Trends 17 April 2020 09:35 1715\nStatistics & Trends 17 April 2020 09:31 1530\nStatistics & Trends 17 April 2020 08:20 1290\nAssociations 16 April 2020 08:54 1557\nAviation 16 April 2020 08:44 1577\nMICE Industry 16 April 2020 08:40 1543\nHotels & Lodging 16 April 2020 08:32 1481\nAviation 15 April 2020 08:45 1401\nArticles 15 April 2020 08:41 737\nCruises 15 April 2020 08:08 1601\nBusiness Travel 14 April 2020 09:03 1715\nAviation 14 April 2020 08:06 1160\nFeatured Articles 13 April 2020 08:36 861\nFeatured Articles 13 April 2020 08:19 1029\nHotel review: Westgate New York Grand Central Hotel\nModus & Amplio, new brand identity and new collaborations\nThe Radisson Blu Park Hotel, a memorable accommodation in Athens city center\nIthra, an all-purpose cultural destination\nKrakow - a city that does not sleep\nA Quick Guide to Anguilla \u2013 the Best Kept Secret in the Caribbean\nThe best apartment accommodation in the UK.

            "Written by Jack Lee Last updated May 07, 2019\nHome to over 500 ski resorts, its hosted two Winter Olympics, and the ski season here is one of the snowiest in the world! When it comes to pure, unadulterated powder skiing, the Land of the Rising Sun is undisputedly world-class. Here's our top list of the best ski resorts in Japan!\nGo back\nMap View\nTop expert terrain easily accessible in the sidecountry\nEasy access - 40 minutes\u2019 drive from Sapporo\nCons\nSmall ski area won\u2019t keep you busy for long\nSlopes fill up with nearby city dwellers on weekends\nKnown for: Being an economical option for sampling some of Japan\u2019s steeper slopes and its famous powder\nBeginners and Experts, the slopes at Sapporo Teine are all yours!\nSkiing at Sapporo Teine offers one of the cheapest ways to experience the legendary powder that Japan is so famous for. With just under 188 ac of skiable terrain it\u2019s not a particularly big resort, and the vertical drop of 2,240 ft isn\u2019t much to write home about either, but slopes with a 38\u00b0 pitch sure make up for it! It actually does get pretty steep here, something that Japanese ski resorts in general aren\u2019t renowned for.\nSki Terrain to Satisfy Both Beginners & Experts\nIf you\u2019re still learning how to ski or snowboard this resort offers plenty to keep you busy, and there is even a green trail running from the very top of the resort at 3,356 ft. For skiers who are most at home when off-piste, powder stashes and tree skiing are easy to find just behind the boundary ropes, but remember that skiing out of bounds is at your own risk! The only group of skiers who might feel let down by the terrain here are intermediates. If you fall into this category consider a more intermediate-friendly Japanese ski resort, like Kiroro.\nWith views like these, it\u2019s hard to say no to Sapporo Teine\nThe Snow, Sea, and City All in One View!\nBeing literally just outside of Hokkaido\u2019s biggest city, Sapporo Teine holds something unique over most other ski resorts in Japan. Head to the Highland Zone at the top and you\u2019ll not only be able to gaze on the white mountains surrounding you, but look down and you\u2019ll see the urban patchwork of Sapporo along with the endless blue of Ishikari Bay. It honestly is a rare view among ski destinations and enough of a reason by itself to visit! With the city so close by, this place does fill up quick on the weekends so try to come during weekdays if you can!\nExcellent off-piste and backcountry without the crowds!\nPlenty of trails to keep intermediate skiers carving up corduroy all day\nConsistent powder makes it easy to find freshies on weekdays\nOffers a traditional Japanese ski vacation experience including cheap and authentic cuisine to enjoy off the slopes\nEasy access to Naeba for more terrain to explore\nCons\nResort doesn\u2019t focus much on terrain parks so freestylers could be disappointed\nHigh altitude means it can get bitterly cold and windy here\nNot many facilities or activities for families and new beginner skiers\nNightlife is practically non-existent\nKnown for: Offering a truly authentic Japanese ski experience away from the crowds\nExcellent skiing without the crowds at Kagura\nIt\u2019s barely two hours by train out of the Japanese capital, but the snow-drenched peaks of Kagura are a world away from the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo. With 417 ac of skiable terrain and 23 trails, one of which stretches for over 4 mi, it\u2019s far from a small ski resort by Japanese standards. However, it\u2019s what lies beyond the boundaries that make this place so special. The highest lift-served point here sits at over 6,050 ft, from where you can access many off-piste tree runs packed with exceptionally good powder. The only downside to this high altitude is the freezing temperatures and wind chill, so just make sure you wrap up warm!\nScore Pristine Backcountry Powder Without the Crowds\nKagura is relatively unknown to the international ski world, so you won\u2019t find that many skiers from overseas nor many crowds on the mountain here. It really is a hidden gem considering how much amazing backcountry there is to explore, with much of it perfectly suited for a skier\u2019s first foray into a powder-filled wilderness. Even though you won\u2019t find much in the way of gnarly chutes or huge cliff jumps here, there\u2019s enough variety to keep experienced backcountry skiers entertained. Talk to the guys at Mikuni Cat Skiing to arrange a guided tour!\nEnter the awesome backcountry at your own risk or just grab a guide!\nVisit Naeba on the Dragondola to Ski an Entirely New Mountain\nOnce you ski everything that Kagura has to offer, you can access a whole other ski area via a lift that runs for almost 4 mi! Dubbed the Dragondola, this remarkable feat of engineering is one of the longest ski lifts in the world. It\u2019ll get you over to Naeba, where another 22 courses are waiting for you to carve up. When you combine the terrain of both Kagura and Naeba you have yourself a pretty big ski area, along with fun ski touring adventures between these two stand-alone resorts!\nReliable snowfall and uncrowded trails for every level of skier\nBig inbounds tree skiing zone complete with a lift to drop you off at the start\nGreen runs on the lower and upper sections of the mountain\nEasy to access the entire ski area using the two cozy gondolas\nAuthentic Onsen/ hot springs village\nCons\nIt\u2019s prohibited to ski many of the powder stashes between the slopes\nCan be difficult to make it over the flat spots, speeding is essential\nHaving to skate or walk some parts of trails is not that uncommon!\nBusy on-mountain restaurants mean long waits for meals\nKnown for: Its delightfully old-fashioned hot spring town and inbounds off-piste tree skiing\nRace trails in the distance at Nozawa Onsen\nBefore skiing transformed this historic mountain village into the fantastic ski resort it is today, people came to Nozawa Onsen for its healing hot spring baths. Now it combines these two attractions perfectly, along with retaining its small-town feel despite its new found fame. The ski area on Mount Kenashi is well-suited for skiers of all abilities, with gentle green groomers to cruise along and steep blacks to race down. Spectacular scenery awaits too, especially at the end of the day when the sun sets in front of skiers making their last run down the mountain!\nTry out the Tree Skiing\nNozawa Onsen makes it easy for skiers to go from on-piste schussing to deep snow skiing. Thanks to an inbounds tree skiing area easily accessed from the highest point in the resort you don\u2019t have to duck any ropes to find freshies! Being way up high means this spot fills up with white stuff after a dump and there\u2019s no grooming to pack it down. Ride the Yamabiko Four chair to get a birds-eye view of the terrain on offer, then go test out your powder skiing skills.\nDuck into the trees at Yamabiko ski area\nVisit Revered Onsens & Experience Unique Festivities\nOnsens are found all over Japan, but in Nozawa Onsen they are held in particularly high regard. There are many to choose from around town, with the standout being the longstanding O-yu onsen. Located right in the middle of town, its ornate wooden facade is unmissable. There\u2019s something else that attracts people to the town too, the spectacular Dosojin Fire Festival. It\u2019s been running since 1863, held on the 15th of January each year, and this traditional celebration involves battling torch bearers and quaffing down sake throughout the evening!\nPractically no crowds here makes it easy to find freshies!\nAmazing backcountry and sidecountry to explore\nExpect huge dumps of top quality powder\nEnjoy an authentic contemporary Japanese ski trip\nCons\nNot many on-piste trails suited for expert skiers\nCan be difficult to get here, few transfer options and difficult to drive yourself\nOnly accommodation options are the two on-site hotels\nSki hire facilities are few and far between\nKnown for: Being a modern ski resort with easy access to epic backcountry\nYou won't find crowds here at Kiroro!\nA modern Japanese ski resort that only opened up shop in 1991, Kiroro enjoys all the benefits of well-thought-out planning and a top-notch lift system. It\u2019s perfectly suited for destination skiers ready to spend all day on the mountain, then ski right back into their hotel at the bottom of the slopes. In fact, that\u2019s your only option at this purpose-built ski resort, because there really is little to do outside of your hotel at night.\nDecent Variety of Trails & Unreal Backcountry\nThe 21 trails here are spread out across two mountain peaks, and many of them are fantastically wide and long, no matter how steep they are. The longest course stretches for just over 3 mi, and there\u2019s plenty to keep beginner and intermediate skiers happy for days on end. Advanced skiers won\u2019t find that much to challenge them on-piste, but outside of the resort boundaries there\u2019s powder-filled backcountry to absolutely rave about!\nUnlike Niseko, there's plenty of room for everyone!\nSame Great Snow as Niseko, Minus the Crowds!\nPerhaps Kiroro\u2019s biggest draw for those in the know is how overlooked this ski resort is by international visitors. It\u2019s true that not much English is spoken here and that there isn\u2019t really a ski village with restaurants and nightlife to enjoy, but if epic skiing is your number one priority this place is an absolute gem. Whether you\u2019re in the backcountry bouncing through waist-deep powder or cutting lines through the fresh corduroy, finding other skiers in your way is not a problem, unlike at the much busier Niseko nearby.\nHigh alpine territory keeps temperatures low and snow in fantastic condition\nPlenty of off-piste tree skiing is kept open here\nQuiet mountain trails to suit all levels of skier\nExcellent interconnectivity of ski lifts and slopes across multiple resorts\nAn abundance of ski-in/ski-out hotels, a few even have their own gondola!\nCons\nWindhold can shut down exposed sections of the upper mountains\nNot many restaurants and bars to visit outside of the big hotels\nHard to explore off the slopes unless you have your own wheels\nSmoking areas next to the gondolas aren\u2019t pleasant to walk through\nKnown for: Serving up the biggest interconnected ski area in the entire country\nMade of 19 ski resorts, you\u2019ll be skiing for days at Shiga Kogen\nWelcome to the largest interconnected ski area in Japan! Shiga Kogen is made up of 19 separate ski resorts, with trails running between them through the mountains and a shuttle bus operating on the roads below. Being able to visit different alpine villages during your ski day gives it a European feel, and our top pick from all of them is Yakebitaiyama. Of all the stand-alone ski areas that make up Shiga Kogen, this one is the biggest! It\u2019s also close to the Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park, which makes for an unforgettable day trip off the slopes.\nTake a lift up to sample of Shiga Kogen\u2019s many slopes!\nTall Mountain Makes for Top Quality Snow\nNot only are there more trails at Yakebitaiyama than anywhere else in Shiga Kogen, the mountain here is also the tallest. With a snowy peak standing tall at 6,588 ft, the white stuff stays in excellent condition for longer compared to some nearby resorts. It also enjoys bigger dumps than other ski spots in the region, and that high elevation guarantees some wonderful views. Keep your eyes peeled for special viewing spots marked out by the resort and whip your camera out to capture amazing shots of the Japanese mountains!\nPerfect Corduroy & Powder Skiing Made Easy\nYou won\u2019t encounter any sloppy slope grooming at this place, expert precision is paid to the creation of fresh corduroy each day. Cruising the blues is a real joy here, but so is heading off-piste in search of powder. You\u2019ll find a variety of gates scattered around the resort that point you in the right direction when it comes to exploring out of bounds terrain. The idea is that you\u2019ll end up back inside the ski area once you\u2019ve finished your powder run, which makes venturing off-piste much safer here than at some other Japanese ski resorts.\nInbounds off-piste skiing is allowed here and it\u2019s awesome!\nSnow Cat tours available to safely explore nearby backcountry\nA family-friendly resort with fun activities for non-skiers\nCons\nCrossing between the two main ski areas can be a pain\nNot much variety for accommodation, just four huge tower block hotels\nNon-existent nightlife\nKnown for: Its relaxed attitude towards off-piste skiing and amazing family leisure facilities\nTest out the slopes at Tomamu\nThere aren\u2019t many ski resorts like Tomamu in the world, or even in Japan for that matter. Nestled within a pristine national park and blessed with bundles of fluffy powder during the winter, you could say this flashy resort with 36-story skyscrapers sticks out against the natural splendor surrounding it! Whatever your first impressions might be, once you stay here you\u2019ll realize just how much of a unique and amazing experience this place serves up, both on and off the slopes!\nThe 36-storey skyscrapers are hard to miss here!\nTop Destination for Off-Piste and Backcountry\nUnlike many Japanese ski resorts where off-piste skiing is prohibited and doing so can lose you your lift pass, at Tomamu you can ski off the trails into untracked powder without worrying about ski patrol chasing you! There are marked expert zones that aren\u2019t groomed, but practically all the treed areas between pistes are open to ski if you want to try them! For a guaranteed fix of the deepest powder around this resort, book yourself on a CAT tour and head off into the backcountry of Mt. Karifuri. It really is the ultimate untracked powder experience, and might just be the best experience on snow you\u2019ve ever had!\nFamily-Friendly Skiing & Fun-Packed Activities\nNot only does Tomamu cater well for expert off-piste skiers, there\u2019s also a nice balance of beginner, intermediate, and advanced groomed trails to keep families of all skiing abilities happy. What\u2019s more, off the slopes things can get even more interesting! Mina-Mina Beach features one of the largest indoor wave pools in Japan, and the Ice Village is home to a restaurant, bar, and church made out of ice, along with an ice rink and ice slide! That\u2019s really just the start too, with sledding, snow rafting, snowmobile rides, and even curling all on the activities list here.\nReliable powder dumps and excellent ski touring across resorts\nProfessional level terrain park plus an open gate for backcountry access\nModern and fast lift system combined with quiet trails during the week\nPerfect for family ski vacations\nCons\nNot much variety for on-mountain dining so the few restaurants fill up quickly\nSerious lack of accommodation options at the base areas\nApr\u00e8s-ski leaves much to be desired\nKnown for: Having the finest terrain parks in all of Hakuba and ski terrain to suit all abilities\nBeginner and advanced runs at Goryu\nWhatever you\u2019re looking for on your ski vacation, whether it\u2019s exploring unspoiled backcountry, bouncing over moguls, or jibbing rails, Hakuba 47 & Goryu serves it all up and then some! This ski resort is all about variety, so every skier, no matter what their ability, will find something to keep them happy. On the downside, off the mountain there isn\u2019t so much to do, with just a few places to stay, eat, and drink next to the slopes. However, the advantage of this is that the slopes rarely get crowded!\nAmazing Inbounds Off-Piste\nYou don\u2019t even have head outside of the ski resort boundaries to score deep untracked powder, Hakuba 47 & Goryu have two special off-piste zones where you can get waist-deep in the white stuff! Just sign up for access at the ski patrol hut located at Hakuba 47\u2019s base area and you\u2019ll get your pass. These exclusive high mountain areas are north-facing so the snow stays in great condition for a few days after a dump. Finding freshies has never been easier!\nGet waist deep at Hakuba 47 & Goryu\nUnbeatable Terrain Parks\nIf the incredible skiing across Habuka 47 & Goryu doesn\u2019t impress you then perhaps their epic terrain parks will. Home to the best terrain parks in the Habuka Valley , Hakuba 47 & Goryu serves up some of the most epic features to keep freestylers frothing. You\u2019ll find well-experienced park rats jibbing, jumping and stomping all day long at Hakuba 47\u2019s terrain park and superpipe while those new to the game can test out their first tricks over at the more mellow terrain park at Goryu.\nPros\nA large ski resort by Japanese standards, complete with a variety of trails for all abilities\nIts central location in Hokkaido means snow quality here is often better than at Niseko\nNearby city of Furano offers plenty of amenities, restaurants, and shopping to enjoy\nCons\nAverage snowfall doesn\u2019t match that of Hokkaido\u2019s coastal ski resorts\nThere\u2019s not a great deal of luxury accommodation near the slopes\nKnown for: Blending amazing skiing with an equally amazing cultural experience\nLooking for some of the best pow Japan has to offer?\nFurano has long been one of the most famous ski resorts within Japan, thanks to its place on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit and for having some of the best quality snow of anywhere in the country. Despite its popularity at home, for years and years this place really didn\u2019t get much attention from overseas destination skiers. Well, the secret of Furano is well and truly out now, with visitor numbers increasing year on year, but it\u2019s still far from being overwhelmed or westernized like some other Japanese ski destinations.\nOne of the Best All-Round Ski Resorts in Japan\nFurano has adapted very well to its increasing popularity, catering well for international skiers without losing its authentic Japanese charm. Alongside a fulfilling cultural experience, you\u2019ll enjoy some fantastic skiing here too. The ski area is above par in comparison to the rest of Japan, providing plenty of terrain to suit all abilities. It\u2019s also home to the Furano Ropeway, the fastest ski lift of its kind in the country. Clamber aboard and join up to 100 other skiers and snowboarders heading up to the top of the mountain!\nDon't miss out on this all-rounder!\nEnjoy Local Cuisine & Culture in the City\nBeing so close to the city of Furano, just 4 mi away, means you don\u2019t have to stay right by the slopes. Choose a hotel downtown and have an urban center to explore while you\u2019re not skiing! Even if you choose just to head into the city during the evenings or for a day, you\u2019ll find a huge variety of restaurants serving all manner of traditional Japanese delicacies. Also, the beautiful Blue Pond in nearby Biei is worth a visit if need a day off from skiing, it\u2019s just under an hour away by car.\nFrequent powder dumps keep the slopes topped up all winter\nWide range of terrain, from one-time Olympic ski racing trails to wide gentle groomers\nBackcountry gate beside the top lift makes going off-piste easy\nUpper mountain is quickly reached with fast gondola\nEasy access to the slopes from most lodgings within the resort\nCons\nBeginner terrain is seriously lacking here\nThe upper mountain is exposed so windhold can be a problem\nSome old and slow chairlifts are still in operation here\nWeekends and holidays see plenty of crowds\nKnown for: Having the biggest vertical drop and longest trail of all the resorts in Hakuba Valley\nKurobishi run at Happo One\nWelcome to the largest and most popular ski area in Hakuba Valley ! Happo One has got some serious skiing pedigree, not only because it hosted the Super-G event of the Nagano 1998 Winter Olympics. Skiers have been schussing down the mountain here since the resort opened way back in 1958, and they keep coming back for good reason. Even though Japan isn\u2019t renown for its steeps, this place bucks the trend both on and off-piste. If you\u2019re looking for plenty of challenging terrain Happo One is sure to satisfy, and with plenty of first-rate restaurants and bustling bars you\u2019ll be entertained off the slopes too!\nSki the Skyline Course for an All-Mountain Adventure\nFor a trail that serves up a little bit of everything, there\u2019s no better choice than the Skyline Course. It takes a little imagination to get the most out of this run, but you could honestly lap it all day long without getting bored. Just ski off into the sidecountry to find deep powder between the trees, bumps to bounce through, and banks to launch off. All this is easily accessed from the safety of the groomed piste, which is always nearby for when you get tired and need a quick break!\nFor some mixed groomed and off-piste fun, don't miss the Skyline course\nPilar for Fine Dining & Sakka for Beers Around the Fire\nHappo One really does cater for everyone, whether you\u2019re looking for a top-notch restaurant or just somewhere to hang out and drink with friends. To treat yourself to a sumptuous three-course lunch visit Pilar, where you can ditch your ski boots and get comfy in a pair of slippers! If kicking back around a fire with the smell of street food wafting through the air is more your thing, head to the Sakka base area. Here you\u2019ll find food trucks serving up eats from around the world, with beers flowing, music pumping, and a fire roaring!\nHead up to Pilar for some fancy fine dining\nBundles of dry and light powder to enjoy\nLarge ski area connecting four different resorts and trails to suit all abilities\nExcellent backcountry gate system provides access to out of bounds terrain\nGreat night skiing on offer\nEasy to get to with plenty of transport options running to and between the base areas\nGreat shopping, lively nightlife, and English is widely spoken\nCons\nFresh powder gets tracked out quickly\nOne of the most expensive places to ski in the country\nThe slopes can get crowded, particularly during the holidays\nWith so many westerners visiting it\u2019s not exactly the most authentic Japanese ski experience\nKnown for: Its huge quantities of powder and being very accommodating for overseas skiers\nFreshies and stunning views of Mt Yotei, what more could you ask for?\nNiseko is often the first choice for international skiers and snowboarders planning a ski vacation in Japan, and it really is no surprise why. It\u2019s one of the snowiest ski resorts in Japan, with an awesome variety of terrain, access to amazing backcountry, and plenty of bars and restaurants for entertaining apr\u00e8s-ski! However, its fame has brought with it an increase in prices and crowds on the slopes, while eroding the traditional Japanese charm it once had. Still, if it wasn\u2019t an awesome place to ski people wouldn\u2019t come, and it really is up there with the best ski resorts in the world!\nA Great Resort for First Time Visitors to Japan\nLife is made easy for foreign visitors in Niseko, so you really shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re out of your comfort zone. This place caters for English speakers better than any other ski resort in the country and there are plenty of restaurants serving up western fare. Multiple transport connections also make it really easy to get to, plus there\u2019s accommodation to suit every budget and taste. The Grand Hirafu base area should be your first choice to ease yourself into the Japanese ski experience, but don\u2019t overlook Annupuri, Hanazono, or Niseko Village, they are all worth exploring too.\nNiseko Village is worth exploring if you're a first timer to Japan\nScore a Powder Stash and Some Solitude at Nearby Moiwa\nJust outside of the Niseko United ski area lies a quaint little resort named Moiwa. There are only three lifts here, and little in the way of accommodation or restaurants, but it makes for a fantastic day trip from Niseko. Head here on a powder day to escape the crowds and search out the freshies! The off-piste terrain is the best thing about this place, and the powder gets seriously deep. It can actually be pretty scary when you stop and the white stuff is all the way up to your chest!\nGreat mix of powder-filled off-piste and corduroy groomers to ski\nAn abundance of sidecountry and tree skiing to explore\nThe slopes are much less crowded than nearby Niseko\nCons\nNot much variety of accommodation, difficult to find self-contained apartments\nDining options outside of hotels are limited\nOnly accessible by bus or car, there\u2019s no train service running to the resort\nPartygoers will be disappointed, the nightlife here is very quiet\nKnown for: Having insanely deep powder like Niseko but without the crowds!\nOur pick for the top resort in Japan!\nSo we come to our top pick for the best ski resort in Japan, the powder nirvana of Rusutsu ! Home to some of the deepest snow you\u2019re ever likely to experience in your life, a place where crowds are non-existent (for now), and offering true indulgence to enjoy off the slopes. As far as ski vacations go, a trip to Rusutsu is one you surely won\u2019t forget. But wait, there must be something wrong with the place right? If you want to party this resort isn\u2019t the best choice, but honestly, after bouncing through powder all day you\u2019ll probably be too exhausted anyway (along with frothing to get out there again in the morning!).\nUnbeatable Powder Skiing for Both Beginners and Experts\nPerhaps what makes Rusutsu such an awesome ski resort is its versatility, with a nice balance of trails to suit all abilities. There\u2019s gentle terrain for first-time powder skiers and terrific tree skiing for those comfy in the steep and deep. The impressive 4,200 ac ski area is spread out over three summits, with Mt. Isola the largest of the trio at just over 3,260 ft. Another thing that makes this resort so great is its modern lift system, with 4 gondolas and 5 high-speed hooded chairlifts to keep you toasty!\nWith an average annual snowfall of 500 in, you won't want to miss Rusutsu!\nVoted Japan\u2019s Best Ski Resort!\nAfter years of being second best to Niseko , Rusutsu finally managed to knock its neighbor off the top spot and take the crown for itself! In fact, not only was Rusutsu voted Japan\u2019s best ski resort at the 2017 World Ski Awards, but The Westin Rusutsu Resort retained its title as Japan\u2019s Best Ski Hotel. It is really the place to live in luxury for your Japanese ski vacation; this resort comes complete with thermal hot spring baths constructed out of healing maifan stone, lavish to say the least!\nFewer crowds than Niseko? Rusutsu is a sure winner!\nGo back\nMap View\nTop resorts in other areas\n"

            "Check Out The Design Of Shake Shack\u2019s Second Outlet\nConceptualised by Zebra, it is inspired by the location, local culture and the eatery\u2019s original outlet in New York\nLOCATION / SINGAPORE\nCOMPLETED / 2020\nGFA / 450M2\nINTERIOR DESIGNER / ZEBRA\nCLIENT / SHAKE SHACK\nIts burgers and beverages are queue-worthy but it is also heartening to know that Shake Shack is championing design and heritage too.\nThe self-professed \u201cmodern day roadside burger stand\u201d opened a second outlet in Singapore last month at 89 Neil Road.\nLocated at the junction of Neil and Craig Road, the building it is in was built in 1924 and has a storied history.\nIt was once home to Eng Aun Tong factory, responsible for producing the famed Singapore-branded Tiger Balm ointment.\nAs a result, it has been granted URA\u2019s Voluntary Conservation Scheme in 1992, ensuring its original neoclassical bones are well-preserved.\nAcross its three storeys are strong geometric lines, arches and columns. On the wall facing The Pinnacle@Duxton is a colourful mural designed by Singaporean artist Sam Lo.\nIt ties in with Shake Shack\u2019s support of the arts and aspiration to work with local purveyors and artists to create a lively gathering place in the city.\nLo sought inspiration from the East and West \u2013 much like the melting pot that is Singapore \u2013 incorporating elements such as glazed ceramic tiles, traditional Peranakan cultural patterns, the Lucky Bat, Qilin and rising sun from local culture.\nStep into the 138-seat Shake Shack and the immediate sense is of contemporary caf\u00e9 chic, courtesy of interior design partners Zebra .\nThe palette is blush pink and mint green, taking its cue from the neighbouring Peranakan-style shophouses.\nLiberally spread throughout the interiors are fittings like plantation shutters, colonial-style rattan fixtures, mosaic tiling and arched wooden panelling.\nThese establish a connection to the agriculture-focused history of the neighbourhood the outlet is located in.\n\u201c89 Neil is thoughtfully designed to mirror Singapore\u2019s distinct Chinatown neighbourhood and honour the rich heritage of the building,\u201d says Lee Roberts, creative director at Zebra.\nAt the same time, Roberts and his team also infused the space with signature Shake Shack elements, balanced out with modern details.\nThere is park bench seating, metal cladding, I-beam signage and lush greenery, referencing the original Madison Square Park location in New York City.\nSome design details were also updated, including rose gold accents, white menu boards and blush terrazzo.\n\u201cWe collaborated with Shake Shack to create warm community gathering places,\u201d says Roberts, of the design intention.\nOur favourite part of this second outlet though, is somewhat less tangible: Shake Shack has adopted Very Special Arts Singapore as a design charity partner.\nFive percent of sales go to the non-profit that provides opportunities for the disabled through the arts \u2013 a move that makes dining there even more palatable.\nBy:\nNewsletter\nType here to search\nAPR / MAY ISSUE 115\nJOIN OUR MAILING LIST\nSubscribe to d+a mailing list to stay updated within the design and architecture community.\nSUBMIT\nAPR / MAY ISSUE 115\nJOIN OUR MAILING LIST\nSubscribe to d+a mailing list to stay updated within the design and architecture community.\nThank you for joining our mailing list.\nSUBMIT\n"

            "How To Design A High-Rise Vertical Greenery System In The Tropics\nHere are some basic strategies to adopt that help to maintain one efficiently and effectively\nVertical greenery systems (VGS) have been one of the widely-accepted design strategies in greening the built environment of Singapore.\nSeveral research studies have emphasised the economic (e.g. higher property values), social (e.g. health and well-being) and environmental (e.g. better microclimate) benefits of VGS.\nHowever, only a few researchers have focused on the issues and their maintainability challenges, specifically in high-rise building facades located in a tropical setting.\nA research study conducted by the NUS Maintainability of Building Lab on the \u201cMaintainability of Green Facades\u201d has highlighted the major VGS defects that mostly occurred in the 60 case studies accessible for field observation works.\nOut of these, 12 were used as instrumental case studies for further investigation and references.\nThe research study is the first comprehensive assessment to determine the green maintainability potential and performance of high-rise VGS in tropical conditions.\nIt aims to promote the value of integrating the maintainability of high-rise VGS facades in tropical conditions during its design inception.\nDesigning with maintainability in mind is crucial in delivering efficient and sustainable buildings.\nChallenges Identified\nBased on the study, there are 10 identified VGS issues.\n1. Climatic conditions: heavy rainfall and strong winds can damage VGS foliage and fallen leaves and even cause withering\n2. Design considerations: provision of inappropriate plant species and unavailability of natural elements\n3. Structural stability and material durability: structural corrosion and bursting of felt\n4. Construction and installation methods: fixtures improperly secured\n5. Water and irrigation systems: water wastage/leakage and poor irrigation\n6. Drainage systems: water dripping on floor/wall and water stagnation/water seepage\n7. Maintenance cost\n9. Environmental considerations: presence of algae and mould, dirt accumulation\n10. Lack of coordination among involved professionals\nUneven plant coverage at the upper level while more growth on the ground level (Source: Author\u2019s filed work photo)\nSome VGS Defects (Source: Chew and Conejos, 2016)\nThe top five VGS defects found in the case studies are:\n1. Plant suitability issues: fallen leaves, withering plants and dirt accumulation\n2. Safety issues: safety issues during cleaning and repairs\n3. Maintenance issues: lack/insufficient maintenance access, algae/biological growth\n4. Drainage issues: water stagnation/ponding\n5. Irrigation issues: poor/faulty irrigation and water dripping, unavailability of natural elements\nGood Practice for VGS Maintenance Access (Source: Conejos et al., 2019)\nBased on best practices and lessons learnt from the study, here are the ABCs of designing high-rise VGS in the tropics.\nThese take into consideration the design for maintainability strategies to reduce the cost and frequency of maintenance, plant replacement and design inconsistency.\nMost importantly, it maximises the VGS performance.\nA\nAdopt a passive approach towards accessibility right from the design stage. Maintenance access should be free from obstacles and barriers, wide and not restrict the transporting of bulky maintenance equipment like wheelbarrows.\nAesthetics of the VGS and their perimeter should be ensured by frequent and proper maintenance regimes. The plant maintenance can be done fortnightly to check their condition, minimising the application of insecticide, clearing dead leaves and checking out for issues. The plants should be irrigated twice daily in the morning and afternoon.\nAlgae and mould growth not only affects the aesthetics of the VGS but can cause slip hazards, especially occurring on floorings and guard rails. Algae growth is prevalent on the substrate panels, on water stains below planter boxes and in areas of water ponding. Thus, waterproofing of the VGS perimeter walls and frequent checks for water ponding and water leakage must be done.\nB\nBacking for the VGS should be fireproof and conforms with the SCDF Fire Code 2013 (i.e. fire-proof aluminum composite backing). Fire safety should be considered at the design stage as an essential requirement for the safety of VGS implementation.\nBird nesting can be prevented through a simple VGS design of high-tensile steel cables, using plant vines and ensuring that the wire trellises grid is narrow in width, so there is no space for birds to roost in the vines.\nBugs and pathogens can be prevented using inorganic growth media instead of organic soil.\nUse thin and lightweight panels (less than 25 kg/m2) to provide ease in handling, installation and maintenance; as well as to accommodate more than plant species, instead of the continuous frame, which can accommodate limited number of plants.\nBiodiversity should be an essential element in the design of the VGS to promote the health of the urban ecosystem.\nC\nChoose the right plant species that are suitable to Singapore\u2019s climate, such as the Thunbergia Ggrandiflora which is a popular choice in climber systems, as it is able to grow fast and reach its mature stage in about six months. Another one is the Bauhinia Kockiana plant species which is native to Singapore.\nCoordination and teamwork during the design stage among landscape architects, designers and structural/M&E engineers are deemed necessary to reduce design inconsistencies.\nChoke issues on gutters due to falling leaves from the VGS may lead to stagnant water and mosquito breeding. Thus, frequent maintenance and clearing of debris is essential in keeping the VGS and its surrounding clean and free from pest infestation.\nD\nDurability of materials, structural stability and good workmanship is the prerequisite for a safe and effective VGS installation and implementation.\nDrainage management and waterproofing must be ensured to prevent water ponding, which is a serious issue that could negatively affect building tenants and overall public health. A best practice example for drainage measures and prevention of algae growth is by having drainage holes built into the base of the trays to prevent water ponding within each tray. This negates the possibility of mosquito breeding and algae growth.\nDesign for Maintainability must be considered right at the outset, so that the lack of drainage and improper drainage systems due to the flat gradient of access walkway surfaces or lack of screed at a gradient can be prevented. VGS installation should not be designed near, at or over the pool deck, which will require frequent cleaning of the pool to preserve water quality. This will also hinder maintenance access during VGS cleaning and replacement.\nUnsafe access to VGS as it is barred by Jacuzzi and constant Jacuzzi cleaning to maintain water quality (Source: Conejos et al., 2019)\nDead zones which are essentially full of dead plant matter can possibly catch fire during dry spells and are potential major fire hazards if not well taken care of and left to dry. This can be prevented if there is sufficient sunlight exposure, planters with sufficient soil and proper irrigation regimes to facilitate even VGS plant coverage.\nDefects should not be left for long periods of time, to prevent irreversible damage and additional spending is required on the replacement of components or a total overhaul. The increased frequency of VGS maintenance cycles will prevent the occurrences of some defects (e.g. excessive algae growth, leaky irrigation), which have surfaced during the VGS completion.\nDr. Sheila Conejos is a Senior Lecturer and Deputy Head of Program in the School of Science and Technology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences .

It is the world\u2019s most-visited art museum, with a collection that spans work from ancient civilizations to the mid-19th century.\nLouvre MuseumLouvre Museum, Paris, with steel-and-glass pyramid designed by I.M. Pei.\n\u00a9 Mary Ann Hemphill/Photo Researchers\nView of the Louvre Museum from across the Seine River, Paris.\n\u00a9 Richard A. McGuirk/Shutterstock.com\nHistory of the building\nIn 1546 Francis I , who was a great art collector, had this old castle razed and began to build on its site another royal residence, the Louvre, which was added to by almost every subsequent French monarch. Under Francis I, only a small portion of the present Louvre was completed, under the architect Pierre Lescot . This original section is today the southwestern part of the Cour Carr\u00e9e. In the 17th century, major additions were made to the building complex by Louis XIII and Louis XIV . Cardinal de Richelieu , the chief minister of Louis XIII, acquired great works of art for the king. Louis XIV and his minister, Cardinal Mazarin , acquired outstanding art collections, including that of Charles I of England. A committee consisting of the architects Claude Perrault and Louis Le Vau and the decorator and painter Charles Le Brun planned that part of the Louvre which is known as the Colonnade.\nThe Colonnade, the eastern facade of the Louvre Museum, Paris, 19th-century print.\nLibrary of Congress, Washington, D.C. (LC-DIG-pga-13069)\nThe Louvre ceased to be a royal residence when Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles in 1682. The idea of using the Louvre as a public museum originated in the 18th century. The comte d\u2019Angiviller helped build and plan the Grande Galerie and continued to acquire major works of art. In 1793 the revolutionary government opened to the public the Mus\u00e9e Central des Arts in the Grande Galerie. Under Napoleon the Cour Carr\u00e9e and a wing on the north along the rue de Rivoli were begun. In the 19th century two major wings, their galleries and pavilions extending west, were completed, and Napoleon III was responsible for the exhibition that opened them. The completed Louvre was a vast complex of buildings forming two main quadrilaterals and enclosing two large courtyards.\nLouvre Museum, Paris, with pyramid designed by I.M. Pei.\n\u00a9 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nThe Louvre building complex underwent a major remodeling in the 1980s and \u201990s in order to make the old museum more accessible and accommodating to its visitors. To this end, a vast underground complex of offices, shops, exhibition spaces, storage areas, and parking areas, as well as an auditorium, a tourist bus depot, and a cafeteria, was constructed underneath the Louvre\u2019s central courtyards of the Cour Napol\u00e9on and the Cour du Carrousel. The ground-level entrance to this complex was situated in the centre of the Cour Napol\u00e9on and was crowned by a controversial steel-and-glass pyramid designed by the American architect I.M. Pei . The underground complex of support facilities and public amenities was opened in 1989. In 1993, on the museum\u2019s 200th anniversary, the rebuilt Richelieu wing, formerly occupied by France\u2019s Ministry of Finance, was opened; for the first time, the entire Louvre was devoted to museum purposes. The new wing, also designed by Pei, had more than 230,000 square feet (21,368 square metres) of exhibition space, originally housing collections of European painting, decorative arts, and Islamic art. Three glass-roofed interior courtyards displayed French sculpture and ancient Assyrian artworks. The museum\u2019s expanding collection of Islamic art later moved into its own wing (opened 2012), for which Italian architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti enclosed another interior courtyard beneath an undulating gold-coloured roof made of glass and steel.\nLouvre Museum, Paris, with pyramid designed by I.M.

The museum, designed by the Japanese architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa , was intended to boost the economy of the region and to alleviate crowds at the Paris site. Five years later, after nearly a decade of delays, the Louvre Abu Dhabi opened in a building designed by French architect Jean Nouvel on Saadiyat Island, the emirate\u2019s planned cultural hub. The new institution was the result of a controversial agreement between the governments of France and the United Arab Emirates , wherein the Louvre leased its name, parts of its collection, and its expertise to the nascent museum for a period of 30 years.\nNouvel, Jean: Louvre Abu DhabiThe Louvre Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, designed by Jean Nouvel.\n\u00a9 Louvre Abu Dhabi; photography, Roland Halbe\nCollection\nThe Louvre\u2019s painting collection is one of the richest in the world, representing all periods of European art up to the Revolutions of 1848 . (Works painted after that date that the Louvre once housed were transferred to the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay upon its opening in 1986.) The Louvre\u2019s collection of French paintings from the 15th to the 19th century is unsurpassed in the world, and it also has many masterpieces by Italian Renaissance painters, including Leonardo da Vinci \u2019s Mona Lisa (c. 1503\u201319), and works by Flemish and Dutch painters of the Baroque period .\nLeonardo da Vinci: Mona LisaA visitor viewing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa (c. 1503\u201319) at the Louvre Museum, Paris.\n\u00a9 Kai Hecker/Shutterstock.com\nThe department of decorative arts displays the treasures of the French kings\u2014bronzes, miniatures, pottery, tapestries, jewelry, and furniture\u2014while the department of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman antiquities features architecture, sculpture, mosaics, bronzes, jewelry, and pottery.

Make that a quadruple threat since he also wrote poetry. Though he bounced between Florence, Bologna and Venice, his greatest commissions were for the Medici Popes (including Julian II and Leo X, among others) in Rome. Aside from the aforementioned Sistine Ceiling, St. Peter's Basilica and Piet\u00e0, there was his tomb for Pope Julian II (which includes his iconic carving of Moses) and the design for the Laurentian Library at at San Lorenzo's Church. Twenty years after painting the Sistine Ceiling, he returned to the Chapel to create one of the greatest frescoes of the Renaissance: The Last Judgment.\nMichelangelo's David, 1501-1504, Galleria dell'Accademia (Florence)\nPhotorgaph: Courtesy CC/Wikimedia/Jorg Bittney Unna\nAdvertising\n3\nRembrandt\nOne the greatest artists in history, this Dutch Master is responsible for masterworks such as The Night Watch and Doctor Nicolaes Tulp's Demonstration of the Anatomy of the Arm. But he is particularly know for portraits in which he demonstrated an uncanny ability to evoke the innermost thoughts of his subjects (including himself through the play of facial expression and the fall of light across the sitter\u2019s features.\nRembrandt van Rijn, Self Portrait as the Apostle Paul, 1661\nPhotograph: Shutterstock\n4\nVermeer\nRemarkably, Vermeer was largely forgotten for two centuries before his rediscovery in the 19th century. Since then, he\u2019s been recognized as one of art history\u2019s most important figures, an artist capable of rendering works of uncanny beauty. Many have argued the Vermeer used a camera obscura\u2014an early form of projector\u2014and certainly the soft blur he employs appears to foreshadow photorealism. But the most important aspect of his work is how it represents light as a tangible substance.\nJohannes Vermeer, Het meisje met de parel (Girl with a Pearl Earring), 1665\nAdvertising\n5\nJean-Antoine Watteau\nWatteau (1684\u20131721) was arguably the greatest French painter of the 18th-century, a transitional figure between Baroque art and the Roccoco style that followed. He emphasized color and movement, structuring his compositions so that they almost resembled theater scenes, but it was the atmospheric quality of his work that would become highly influential for artists like J.M.W Turner and the Impressionists.\nJean-Antoine Watteau, The Shop Sign of Gersaint, (1720\u201321)\nPhotograph: Courtesy CC/Wikimedia Commons/Antoine Watteau\n6\nEugene Delacroix\nEug\u00e8ne Delacroix (1798\u20131863) was one of towering figures of 19th-century art. A leading figure of Romanticism\u2014which privileged emotions over rationalism\u2014Delacroix\u2019s expressive paint handling and use of color laid the foundation for successive avant-garde movements of the 1800s and beyond.\nEugene Delacroix, Self-Portrait with Green Vest, ca. 1837\nPhotograph: Courtesy CC/Wikimedia Commons/cgfa.sunsite.dk via web.archive.org\nAdvertising\n7\nPhotograph: Shutterstock\nClaude Monet\nPerhaps the best know artist among the Impressionists, Monet captured the changeable effects of light on the landscape through prismatic shards of color delivered as rapidly painted strokes. Moreover, his multiple studies of haystacks and other subjects anticipated the use of serial imagery in Pop Art and Minimalism. But the same token, his magisterial, late-career lily pond paintings foreshadowed Abstract Expressionism and Color-Field Abstaction.\nClaude Monet, 1901\nPhotograph: Courtesy The Art Institute of Chicago/Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection\nGeorges Seurat\nMost people know Georges Seurat (1859\u20131891) as the inventor of pointillism (which he actually developed with the artist Paul Signac), a radical painting technique in which small daubs of color where applied to the canvas, leaving it to the viewer\u2019s eye to resolve those dots and dashes into images. Just as importantly, Seurat broke with the capture-the-moment approach of other Impressionists, going instead for ordered compositional style that recalled the stillness of classical art.\nGeorges Seurat, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte, 1884\u20131886\nPhotograph: Courtesy The Art Institute of Chicago/Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection\nAdvertising\n9\nVincent van Gogh\nVan Gogh is legendary for being mentally unstable (he did, after all, cut of part of his ear after an argument with fellow painter Paul Gauguin), but his paintings are among the most famous and beloved of all time. (His painting, The Starry Night, inspired a treacly Top 40 hit by Don McClean.) Van Gogh\u2019s technique of painting with flurries of thick brushstrokes made up of bright colors squeezed straight from the tube would inspire subsequent generations of artists.\nVincent van Gogh, Self Portrait, 1889\nPhotograph: Shutterstock\nEdvard Munch\nI scream, you scream we all scream for Munch\u2019s The Scream, the Mona Lisa of anxiety. In 2012, a pastel version of Edvard Munch\u2019s iconic evocation of modern angst fetched a then-astronomical price of $120 million at auction (a benchmark which has since been bested several times). Munch\u2019s career was more than just a single painting. He\u2019s generally acknowledged as the precursor to Expressionism, influencing artists such 20th-century artists as Egon Schiele, Erich Heckel and Max Beckmann.\nEdvard Munch, The Scream, 1893\nPhotograph: U.S. Public Domain\nEgon Schiele\nVienna at the turn of the 20th century was a hothouse of psychologically and sexually charged tension and repression, and no figure channeled the milieu better than Egon Schiele (1890\u20131918), whose fevered sensibility found expression in drawings and paintings of subjects that were as explicit as they were jittery.\nEgon Schiele, Self Portrait with Physalis, 1912\nPhotograph: Courtesy CC/Wikimedia Commons/Google Arts & Culture\n12\nGustav Klimt\nThe fin de si\u00e8cle Viennese Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt is know for using gold leaf, something he picked up on while visiting the famous Byzantine frescoes in Ravenna Italy. He most famously put the idea to use in his masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\u2014also know as Austria\u2019s Mona Lisa\u2014a painting looted by the Nazis during World War II. The story of its eventual return to its rightful owner served as the basis of the film, Woman In Gold, starring Helen Mirren. Another Klimt painting, The Kiss, is equally iconic.\nGustav Klimt, 1914\nPhotograph: Electa/UIG/REX/Shutterstock\nPablo Picasso\nBorn in M\u00e1laga, Spain, Pablo Picasso is undoubtedly one of the most famous artists ever. His name is virtually synonymous with modern art, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that he fits the commonly held image of the outlaw genius whose ambitions are matched by an appetite for living large. He changed the course of art history with revolutionary innovations that include collage and, of course, Cubism, which broke the stranglehold of representational subject matter on art, and set the tempo for other 20th-century artists. He utterly transformed multiple mediums, making so many works that it\u2019s hard to grasp his achievement.\nPablo Picasso, Woman with Fan, 1909\nPhotograph: Electa/UIG/REX/Shutterstock\nHenri Matisse\nNo artist is as closely tied to the sensual pleasures of color as Henri Matisse. His work was all about sinuous curves rooted in the traditions of figurative art, and was always focused on the beguiling pleasures of pigment and hue. \u201cI am not a revolutionary by principle,\u201d he once said. \u201cWhat I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity, devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter\u2026a soothing, calming influence on the mind, something like a good armchair.\u201d\nHenri Matisse, Paris, May 13th, 1913\nPhotograph: Alvin Langdon Coburn\nPhotograph: Electa/UIG/REX/Shutterstock\nRene Magritte\nThe name Ren\u00e9 Magritte is widely recognized by art lovers and agnostics alike, and for good reason: He utterly transformed our expectations of what is real and what is not. When someone describes something as \u201csurreal,\u201d the chances are good that an image by Magritte pops into his or her head.\nMagritte Rene, The Roof of the World, 1926-1927\nPhotograph: Electa/UIG/REX/Shutterstock\nSalvador Dal\u00ed\nDal\u00ed was effectively Warhol before there was a Warhol. Like Andy, Dal\u00ed courted celebrity almost as an adjunct to his work. With their melting watches and eerie blasted landscapes, Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings were the epitome of Surrealism, and he cultivated an equally outlandish appearance, wearing a long waxed mustache that resembled cat whiskers. Ever the consummate showman, Dal\u00ed once declared, \u201cI am not strange. I am just not normal.\u201d\nSalvador Dal\u00ed with Babou, the ocelot and cane, 1965\nAdvertising\n17\nPhotograph: Alfred Stieglitz\nGeorgia O\u2019Keeffe\nGeorgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s reputation rests in part on the idea that many of her paintings evoke a certain part of the female anatomy. O'Keeffe herself angrily rejected the notion that her compositions\u2014especially her floral studies\u2014were symbolic representations of vaginas, but the idea has stuck. Nevertheless, there so much more to the artist\u2019s work, which could be described as a blend of symbolism, precisionism and abstraction.\nGeorgia O'Keeffe, 1918\nPhotograph: Alfred Stieglitz\nEdward Hopper\nHopper\u2019s enigmatic paintings look into the hollow core of the American experience\u2014the alienation and loneliness that represents the flip side of to our religious devotion to individualism and the pursuit of an often-elusive happiness. In compositions such as Nighthawks, Automat and Office in a Small City, he captures stillness weighed down by despair, his subjects trapped in the limbo between aspiration and reality. His landscapes are similarly suffused with a sense that America\u2019s open spaces are as purgatorial as they are limitless.\nEdward Hopper, Self Portrait, 1906\nAdvertising\n19\nFrida Kahlo\nThe Mexican artist and feminist icon was a performance artist of paint, using the medium to lay bare her vulnerabilities while also constructing a persona of herself as an embodiment of Mexico\u2019s cultural heritage. Her most famous works are the many surrealistic self-portraits in which she maintains a regal bearing even as she casts herself as a martyr to personal and physical suffering\u2014anguishes rooted in a life of misfortunes that included contracting polio as a child, suffering a catastrophic injury as a teenager, and enduring a tumultuous marriage to fellow artist Diego Rivera.\nFrida Kahlo, 1932\nPhotograph: Guillermo Kahlo\nJackson Pollock\nHampered by alcoholism, self-doubt and clumsiness as a conventional painter, Pollock transcended his limitations in a brief but incandescent period between 1947 and 1950 when he produced the drip abstractions that cemented his renown. Eschewing the easel to lay his canvases fait on the floor, he used house paint straight from the can, flinging and dribbling thin skeins of pigment that left behind a concrete record of his movements\u2014a technique that would become known as action painting.\nJackson Pollock, Reflection of the Big Dipper, 1947\nPhotograph: History Archive/REX/Shutterstock\nAndy Warhol\nTechnically, Warhol didn\u2019t invent Pop Art, but he became the Pope of Pop by taking the style out of the art world and bringing it into the world of fashion and celebrity. Starting out as a commercial artist, he brought the ethos of advertising into fine art, even going so far as to say, \u201cMaking money is art.\u201d Such sentiments blew away the existential pretensions of Abstract Expressionism. Although he\u2019s famous for subjects such as Campbell\u2019s Soup, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, his greatest creation was himself.\nAndy Warhol\nPhotograph: Aflo/REX/Shutterstock\nYayoi Kusama\nKusama (born 1929) is one of the most famous artists working today. Her huge popularity stems from her mirrored \u201cInfinity Rooms\u201d that have proved irresistible for Instagram users, but her career stretches back over six decades. Starting as a child, the Japanese artist began to suffer from hallucinations that manifested as flashes of light or auras, as well as fields of dots and flowers that talked to her. These experiences have provided the inspiration for her work, including the aforementioned rooms along with paintings, sculptures and installations that employ vivid, phantasmagorical patterns of polka dots and other motifs. Between 1957 and 1972, she lived in NYC, where she gained notoriety for chairs upholstered with stuffed-fabric phalluses, as well as outdoor happenings that involved public nudity. Her psychological afflictions, though, have continued to plague her, and in 1977, she committed herself to mental hospital in Japan where she\u2019s lived ever since.\nPhotograph: Aflo/REX/Shutterstock\nPhotograph: Courtesy CC/Flickr/Wally Gobetz\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Collective\nLoosely defined, an art collective is a group of artists working together to achieve a common objective\nArtists working within a collective are united by shared ideologies, aesthetics and, or, political beliefs.\nIn the early modern period, there were roughly two forms of art collective. Those who sought to bring about social change by cultural means like the futurists . They looked towards the future where they envisioned a radically new way of life. Others, like the dada artists, represented the psychological consequences of the loss of a pre-modern existence and reflected that in their art. They spoke for a collective group, in this case those mentally and physically scarred by the First World War.\nToday, thanks to social media, art collectives have an extraordinary global reach, giving them the power to bring about change through direct action. Collectives today are about the present and how they can change society in the here and now.\nWe Recommend\nJoin in\n"

            "October 31, 2016\nIn order to understand what an artist collective is, we can turn to an unlikely scene that is familiar to most \u2013 that of hip hop. Rap collectives have been around for a couple of decades now and can give us a pretty clear image on how those in the modern world function too. Gathered around shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views, tightly-knit groups of artists on common goals and create works (of all kinds, whether it be music, painting, sculpture, performance or something altogether different) supporting and promoting the pieces of every member of the collective. Yet not all goals are quite so lofty. Often, reasons can be very mundane and practical, such as sharing equipment, space or materials, cutting the costs of production, as well as promotion and more effective media exposure programs and visual arts foundation. Regardless of the background story, such forms of association have been a staple of the creative scene since its very beginning. From ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on Milos to intricately organized medieval painter\u2019s guilds, from monumental decoration projects of the baroque to the groups formed during and after Russian revolution \u2013 creative minds have always worked together, at least to a certain extent. In fact, the idea (or should we say stereotype?) of the solitary, misunderstood rebels is a relatively new one. Today\u2019s popular discussions on the internet over the idea of extroverts vs. introverts, with creators commonly being placed in the latter category in the past, shed only a partial light on the whole matter. In reality, practitioners of creative skills have more often than not worked in groups, with or without a hierarchy.\nThe collectives themselves, as we know them today, arose as a social unit in the 1960\u2019s. In a time not too different from our own \u2013 marred by nuclear proliferation, threats of terrorism, increasingly right-wing discourse and fragmentation of society into opposed groups \u2013 a counterculture, quite liberal in outlook, arose, with political protest movements becoming an alternative way of life. It produced a string of influential and immensely creative groups. Fluxus blurred the lines and practically blending visual skills with music and literature. The futurist, anti-heroic and pro-consumerist architectural group Archigram and the Ant Farm that, in the 70\u2019s, produced works on the fringe of architecture, both stretched the definition of architecture as it was known until then. General Idea were a collective of pioneers in conceptual and media-based pieces, while Guerrilla Girls represented a quintessential feminist group with their shocking tactics, always wearing gorilla masks, miniskirts, and fishnet stockings, tirelessly working on promoting women artists. The Cacophony Society, a randomly gathered network of free spirits united in the pursuit of experiences beyond those of mainstream society and arts center, and Critical Art Ensemble, specializing in computer graphics and web design, photography, film, video and performance, dominated the last decade of the millennium.\nIn the 21st century, the world seems as tense, as divided, and as threatening as it did half a century ago. Yet again, creators are coming together into collectives, setting their own rules, establishing networks, and breaking all the conventions (sometimes even living and working together as an extended family), creating together in pursuit of shared aims, under their own management. The last decade or so has seen the birth and flourishing of several important artist collectives that push the boundaries of creativity in contemporary world to a whole new level. Bringing together ideas, methods and styles as far flung as architecture and fashion, guerilla social activism and painting, trend forecasting, digital media and large-scale installations, these collectives are as ever-changing and as diverse as each of their artists\u2019 members.\nImages in slider: teamLab \u2013 Crystal Tree, 2015 \u2013 image via team-lab.net; Assemble \u2013 The Cineroleu \u2013 image via assemblestudio.co.uk; The Miss Rockaway Armada \u2013 Let Me Tell You About A Dream I Had \u2013 Photo Credits Nicole Steinberg; Gelitin \u2013 Rabbit, 2005 \u2013 image via gelitin.net\nteamLab - Investigation of Modern Human Behavior\nFounded in 2001 by Toshiyuki Inoko in Tokyo, Japan, teamLab is an interdisciplinary group of ultra-technologists. Relying on the tradition of ancient Japanese art as well as 21st century forms of anime and manga, their practice seeks to navigate the information and contact of arts, technology, design, and the natural world around us. They investigate human behavior in the information era, effectively proposing innovative models of social and cultural development and change. With installations scaled up to larger-than-life proportions, their works are a labyrinth of virtual experiences. Having been subject of numerous exhibitions and programs across the globe, teamLab are possibly one of the most recognizable arts collectives in the international art circles today.\nFeatured image: teamLab \u2013 Wander Through the Crystal Universe, 2016 \u2013 image via designboom.com\nAssemble - Merging Artistic Expression and Social Activism\nEmbracing a DIY sensibility, Assemble are a London-based collective whose work spans the fields of art, architecture and design. Focusing on projects that involve and benefit the people who use and inhabit them, they merge artistic expression and social activism in a community-oriented way. Described by one of the members as sort of architects, sort of not, sort of maybe, in 2015 they became the first non-artists to win the prestigious Turner Prize for their work tackling urban dereliction in Toxteth, Liverpool. Resolutely valuing people over profits, Assemble have remained faithful to what they call the unfashionable art of making a difference.\nFeatured image: Assemble \u2013 Granby Four Streets installation at the Turner prize show in Glasgow \u2013 image via guim.co.uk\nMiss Rockaway Armada - Nautics-Inspired Artworks\nBased in Philadelphia, Miss Rockaway Armada is both a collection of individuals and an idea. 13 creatives make up this nationally recognized collective. With a history of making nautics-inspired art pieces, starting with a convoy of raft-like sculptures that floated down the Mississippi in 2006, the also work in graffiti and other forms of street art, present musical and theatrical performances, as well as art installations. In November 2013, their How to Turn Anything into Something Else project included 31 Mural Arts art education students aged 10 to 15. They were offered creative exercises to more easily access their imagination, which meant to show students that not every idea needs to end the way it began.\nFeatured image: The Miss Rockaway Armada \u2013 Let Me Tell You About A Dream I Had (view inside the raft) \u2013 image via guim.co.uk\nGelitin - Masters of Decay Art\nA group of four creatives from Vienna, Austria, Gelitin was formerly known as gelatin but changed their name in 2005. Infused with a lively sense of humor, their sensational arts and cultural events are in the tradition of relational aesthetics. Having first met in 1978 at a summer camp center they started exhibiting internationally in 1993 and represented Austria at the 2001 Venice Biennale. Their most famous piece to date may be The Rabbit, a giant (55m tall) plush toy installed thanks to the artists\u2019 efforts in 2005 at Colletto Fava, Piemont, Italy. Having taken well over five years to make and donate, this fine example of decay art is intended to remain there until November 2025.\n0100101110101101.ORG - Groundbreaking Net Art\nPioneers of the Net Art movement, Eva and Franco Mattes are a duo of artists from Italy currently based in New York City. They collaborate under the pseudonym 0100101110101101.org and are renowned for their subversion of public media. Producing pieces that involve ethical and political issues, they investigate the fabrication of situations, where fact and fiction merge into one. This is particularly true of events and ideas that arise from the inception of the internet. Overtaking of the domain name vaticano.org, fabrication of the fictional recluse artist Darko Maver, experimental works employing the video game Second Life are but a few of their more recent projects.\nFeatured image: 0100101110101101.org \u2013 Now you\u2019re in my computer, 2007 \u2013 Courtesy of the artists\nK-HOLE - Commercial Ventures with a Twist\nRiding the line between commercial venture and creative collab, K-HOLE is a collective that breaks the mold by working outside the gallery space and often dealing with big businesses. The most Googled fashion word of 2014 \u2013 #Normcore \u2013 sprung from one of their trend forecasting PDFs and put the group on the map. With their name being a slang term for the subjective state of dissociation from the body induced by dissociative anesthetic ketamine, they are however very much in touch with reality, having worked as a trend forecasting group for MTV, Coach, Kickstarter, Stella Artois, and the Museum of Modern Art.\nFeatured image: K-HOLE \u2013 Being special vs. being free \u2013 image via studiovisitsshow.com\nThe Con Artist Collective - Ever-Evolving Creative Group\nWhile most collectives comprise of a small and usually permanent lineup of members, others tend to be far larger and ever-evolving. The Con Artist Collective, founded in 2010, is an art collective, community, workspace and gallery that hosts events, publications, collaboration, and products. While the core of the group is more or less permanent, the general majority of members are free to join and leave as they wish, each adding something of their own creative vision to the ever-expanding and changing ethos of the group. A veritable beehive of creativity, it lifts the concept of artists working together to a whole new level.\nFeatured image: The Con Artist Collective \u2013 No.1986-K10 , 2010 \u2013 image via flickr.com\nPaper Rad - Recreating Digital Aesthetic\nWith three primary members \u2013 Jacob Ciocci, Jessica Ciocci, and Ben Jones \u2013 Paper Rad are a collective dividing their time between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Providence, Rhode Island. At once affirmative and critical, their pieces posess an exuberantly neo-primitivist digital aesthetic. In keeping with their focus on current pop culture and media, Paper Rad synthesize popular material from television, video games, and advertising, making comics, zines, net art, video art, MIDI files, installations, paintings, and music. The rules of their style and practice are No Wacom tablet, no scanning, pure RGB colors only, only fake tweening, and as many alpha tricks as possible.\nFeatured image: Paper Rad \u2013 Ice Cream Truck, 2010 \u2013 image via blogspot.com\nBernadette Corporation - Between Performance and Fine Art\nArt and fashion collective founded in 1994, an offspring of the 90\u2019s NYC club-kid scene, Bernadette Corporation core members include Bernadette van Huy, John Kelsey, and Antek Walzcak. Basing their views on anti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century, they indulge in performance, fashion, and art which in different ways emulates and disturbs corporations. They believe the key to running a successful collective: dress for job, learn proper manners \u2013 and don\u2019t have sex with each other. Presenting a conceptual alternative for making art, they write novels, host events, do films, create fashion and so much more.\nFeatured image: Bernadette Corporation \u2013 2000 Wasted Years, 2013 \u2013 Courtesy of the artist and Greene Naftali, New York.\nArtists Anonymous - Full-Fledged Interdisciplinarity\nTaking pride in their participation in a cultural system that is now open to anything, by anyone, from anywhere, Artists Anonymous are an art group based in Berlin and London. Always having a number of shows and projects at various different stages of development, their work ranges from mixed media to full-fledged interdisciplinarity, covering a wide variety of themes and issues. The collective was founded in 2001, during their studies at Berlin University of the Arts. In 2007 they organized and set up their own exhibition space in London, and in September 2012 held their first show with Banksy at Lazarides Gallery.\nFeatured image: Artists Anonymous \u2013 Balron (Detail), 2011 \u2013 image via riflemaker.com\nAngela de la Cruz - Stretching Paintings Into Sculptures\nSituated somewhere in between painting and sculpture, the work of Angela de la Cruz centers around the stretcher that is usually used for keeping the canvas smooth and pliant. In this way, she engages with the discourse about the \u201cproblem\u201d of painting. Mangling the stretcher and piercing the flat edifice of the canvas to unleash it into three-dimensional space, her works become transformed into something closer to sculptures.\nFeatured image: Angela de la Cruz, via gettyimages.com; Angela de la Cruz \u2013 Larger than Life, 2004, via lissongallery.com\nFollow These Artists\nRead Other Interesting Stories\nWe aim at providing better value for money than most.\nLogin Registration\nPlease leave this field empty\nEmail *\nSubscribe\nCheck your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.\nSign Up With\n"

            "What Is World History?\nThere are a few key qualities that set world history apart from other types of history. World historians use a wide spatial lens, though they do not always take the entire world as their unit of analysis. They tend to de-emphasize individual nations or civilizations, and focus instead on regions defined differently, including zones of interaction, or on the ways in which people, goods, and ideas moved across regions through migration, conquest, and trade. Most world historians think that history should be studied on a range of chronological and spatial scales, including, but not limited to, very large ones. Some world history has a narrow temporal framework, examining developments around the world in a single decade or even a single year. Other historians use an expanded timeframe, beginning with the Big Bang to examine history on a cosmic scale. Histories of single commodities such as salt, sugar, or silver can be world history, as can those of single individuals, organizations, or ideas.\nIn the twenty-first century, world historians are building on different national and regional roots and traditions to create a multivocal version of world history, working upwards and outwards from the available sources in multiple languages and from multiple sites. World history today is a research field, with academic journals, conferences, books, and research centers, as well as a teaching field, from primary school through postgraduate work. Scholars, teachers, and students have developed innovative approaches and materials and regularly engage in debates about theory, methodology, and content on Web sites, blogs, and in print.\nPeople have actually been doing world history for a long time. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus set his story of the war between the Persians and the Greeks within the context of the world as he knew it, and the ancient Chinese historian Sima Qian told history through an encyclopedic presentation of events, activities, and biographies of emperors, officials, and other important people. Medieval chroniclers in India, Europe, and the Muslim world devised \u201cuniversal histories\u201d that began with the creation of the world, and from the fifteenth through the nineteenth centuries scholars, poets, nuns, physicians, obscure officials, former slaves, and others wrote histories with a broad scope. In the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, however, the focus of most professional history\u2014that is, history written by men trained at universities\u2014became the nation-state, which fit with the rising importance of nations as political units and with growing nationalism.\nBut after World War II, scholars and teachers began to challenge nationally-organized histories. In the United States, area studies programs at universities increasingly trained people to study many parts of the world, some professional historians began to write works with a broad scope, and college instructors and high school teachers created courses in world history. In Europe, the study of diplomacy gradually widened into imperial, international, and what was termed \u201coverseas\u201d history. Beginning in the 1980s, scholars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America critiqued much existing world and international history as overly centered on Europe, and posited different centers or called for a more polycentric world history. The 1990s brought other new directions, including transnational history, histoire crois\u00e9e, Transfergeschichte, Atlantic World history, borderlands histories, connected history, world systems history, diasporic history, and many others. Some historians began to describe their field as global history, to reflect the increasing integration of world regions into a single system through globalization, though other historians see world and global history as the same.\nToday world history has many shapes and many voices. The World History Association is proud to be one of those voices, and we hope you will look elsewhere on this site to see all that we do, including publications , conferences , and awards . The Network of Global and World History Organizations ( NOGWHISTO ), the international umbrella group to which the World History Association belongs, has prepared a bibliography of recent works in world history which can provide an overview of current trends in world history scholarship worldwide.\n7 April 2020 0\n"

Even the earliest histories we have today\u2014some dating back thousands of years\u2014grapple with making sense of everything that came before them. Infoplease is here to help you get everything in order.\u00a0Check out the 100 Most Significant Events of the Last Thousand Years, an ancient history timeline, world history timelines and more.\nPre-Modern1 History\nBeginning with the Earth's formation, through\u00a0to the beginning of the modern day,\u00a0fan favorites like ancient Egypt, Babylon, Harappa, Rome, and Aksum make their debuts. Though they have a less direct impact on the world today, these historic cultures held major influence over the course of history. The inventions of agriculture, fire, megalithic construction, and speech are the foundations of human life, as well as the development of the arts\u00a0and sciences.\u00a0Check out our timelines to discover more about these remote (and often unrecognizable) times.\nEarly Modern2 History\nWith the \"rediscovery\" of Classical learning in the West, the invention of new economic models like mercantilism, and increased contact around the globe, the world begins to take the shape it has today. Early modernity will see the creation of the nation-state, the rise of capitalism and colonialism, and the beginnings of industrialization. Across the entire world, from Mali to the Maratha, this time period will see\u00a0the consolidation and rise of thousands of notable polities and countries. Explore some of the highlights from this defining period of human history.\nLate Modern3 History\nLate modernity, if it can be meaningfully distinguished from \"now\" ends with World War II and\u00a0the beginning of the atomic era. The late modern period is characterized by industry, locomotion, the peak of colonialism in Africa and Asia, and the beginnings of industrialized warfare. By the end of this time period, the multinational empires of the past will begin to break apart, paving the way for the current nations of the world.\nContemporary\u00a0History\nContemporary history begins with the splitting of the atom and the rise of computers. These two new technologies more than anything else will fundamentally shape the course of human affairs. The contemporary period is characterized by the end of colonial imperialism, the rise of global capitalism and neocolonialism, and the rapid growth of global communication. Being the present, it's impossible to say when or how this time period may end.\n1. The distinction between modern and pre-modern is a bit shaky at times. The most common dispute about when \"modern\" history begins is whether it starts right before or right after the Middle Ages (being named as such because they fall between Classical history and Modern history). Ultimately the distinction between modern and pre-modern is fairly arbitrary, especially when applied to places outside of Europe.\n2.\u00a0The editors at Infoplease have decided to split the divide around the beginning of the Italian Renaissance.\u00a0With the Italian Renaissance, things start to look more familiar than in the Middle Ages. Medieval societies were built around systems of government, economic practices, and schools of thought that are often completely alien to today's readers, while by the Renaissance things like standing armies, stock-bond companies, and ethnic states come into play.\n3. The division between early modernity and late modernity is also relatively fuzzy, as it's most commonly decided based on industrialization and complex modes of production. These factors arise at different times in different places, and are not universal metrics of \"progress.\" For simplicity's sake, the editors have marked the break with the industrialization of the United Kingdom and the United States.\nIt's important to stay informed. We've put together a list of sources so you can stay up to date on the ongoing pandemic.\nInfoplease knows the value of having sources you can trust. Infoplease is a reference and learning site, combining the contents of an encyclopedia, a dictionary, an atlas and several almanacs loaded with facts. Our editors update and regularly refine this enormous body of information to bring you reliable information.\nFooter\n"

            "ANNOUNCEMENT \u2014 The Museum is closed from 26 March 2020. A re-opening date will be announced on our website and social channels once confirmed.\nAbout The Museum\nVision\nThe Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum strives to be a leader in Southeast Asian biodiversity \u2013 in research, education and outreach.\nWe aim to:\nNurture public interest in biodiversity and associated environmental issues\nMaintain and grow a natural heritage knowledge base that focuses on its huge collection of historical and research specimens\nPursue, encourage, develop, and support biodiversity research in Singapore as well as with partner institutes in Southeast Asia, and internationally\nEndeavour to maintain the relevance of biodiversity and environmental issues in the lives of present and future generations of Singaporeans\nOur Goals\nTHE STRENGTHENING, GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME\nThe museum will continue to grow new areas and encourage the use novel technologies for research and the research collection. Apart from maintaining its Singaporean-Malayan strength, it will also take on an increasingly Southeast Asian perspective.\nINCREASED CURRICULUM RELEVANCE AND EDUCATIONAL ENGAGEMENT\nWITH PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY STUDENTS:\nThe younger generation needs to be engaged and trained, so there is a pool of capable talent that not only knows about the needs of sustainable development and biodiversity, but also able to serve the cause of conservation, and service national and regional manpower requirements.\nINCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PUBLIC:\nAs a \u201cpeople\u2019s museum\u201d \u2013 the museum not only serves the public\u2019s needs and interests, it should also enthuse and educate them of new developments and challenges, as well as raise the level of environmental awareness.\nTIMELINE:\n1823 \u2013 Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles established the Singapore Institution\n1849 \u2013 Singapore Library proposed the establishment of a museum after receiving a special gift of coins from the Temenggong Ibrahim of Johore.\n1874 \u2013 Official papers which first mentioned funding for \u201cRaffles Library and Museum\u201d in 1874\n1878 \u2013 Legislative Council for the island of Singapore approved the \u201cRaffles Societies Ordinance\u201d, formally making the entity legal\nRegardless of the date one chooses, the Raffles Museum and its present incarnations, the National Museum of Singapore and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, are the oldest such institutes in Southeast Asia. For management purposes and point of law, the date of 16 December 1878 is a practical, and perhaps the most objective one for the \u201cstart\u201d of the natural history museum.\nThe museum inherited the natural history collection from its predecessor, the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research (established in 1998), whose collection was that of the Zoological Reference Collection (formally opened on 31 October 1988), which of course stems from the original Raffles Museum that was renamed the National Museum of Singapore in 1965.\nFormally established as an independent academic unit under the Faculty of Sciences on 1 April 2014. The building housing the museum was built on public donations and sustained by a substantial endowment to safeguard the national collection of animals and natural heritage.\nOperationally, the LKCNHM is composed of two major entities:\nThe plant and animal collections form the core of its existence and is research-centric.\nThe public gallery, together with the teaching and outreach components of the museum.\nThey are supported by the museum\u2019s building management and administrative departments.\nPUBLIC GALLERY\nSpread over 2500 square meters, the biodiversity gallery consists of 15 zones, tracing the history of life on earth, with different sections devoted to the origin of life and all major branches of the Tree of Life. Other sections are thematic zones dedicated to scientific knowledge, exploring topics such as how terrestrial vertebrates evolved from life in the water and why birds are actually \u201cdinosaurs.\u201d The museum is also home to the three much talked-about diplodocid sauropod skeletons, each of them is about 80% complete, making them a rarity in dinosaur discoveries!\nComplementing the biodiversity gallery on the mezzanine floor is the heritage gallery, where the history of the Raffles Museum and LKCNHM forms the backdrop to the history of natural history in Singapore. Explore Singapore\u2019s history of biodiversity work and find out more about the men and women who helped build up the biological treasures that the museum has accumulated over more than 100 years of its history. It also has a zone titled \u201cSingapore Today\u201d, which showcases the geology of the island as well as the important conservation work done by national agencies.\nThe journey through the gallery is also designed to be an experiential one, with the layout as well as natural history specimens chosen with intent to maximise this outcome. The gallery is complemented by a web-based app that allows visitors to find out more about whichever plant, animal or scientific fact they are most interested in.\nCOLLECTIONS\nThe bulk of the space in the museum houses our natural history collections, consisting of two floors for bottled specimens and one floor for dried specimens. The major collections of the LKCNHM are in two parts, the herbarium and the zoological collection.\nNUS Herbarium (SINU)\nThe NUS Herbarium (SINU) was founded in 1955 as a teaching museum by Professor Gilliland of the then Department of Botany. Transferred to the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research in 1998, it serves as a documentation of the rich plant resources in Singapore and Southeast Asia with more 33,000 catalogued specimens in its holdings.\nZoological Reference Collection (ZRC)\nThe major part of the LKCNHM is the Zoological Reference Collection (ZRC), which is renowned internationally. The ZRC is one of the largest collections of Southeast Asian animals in the region with over 560,000 catalogued lots and over a million specimens in total and one of the most comprehensive collections of Singapore and Malayan animal specimens in the world.\nWith active research work being carried out by the museum\u2019s scientists, regional collaborations and many expeditions over the years,the collections have grown by some 50% since the late 1990s. The ZRC also has an active exchange program with museums around the world, from which we have obtained many important species.\nThe museum also regularly receives donations of large collections from private collectors and benefactors; three noteworthy ones being the large collection of cone and cowrie shells from Mr Yap Kim Fatt, a substantial holding of Malayan shells from the late Professor Lim Chuan Fong and Dr Ng Cher Siang, and the most recent being the Fleming Collection of butterlies courtesy of Mr Angus Fleming and Mr T. H. Tan.\nLooking to the future, the museum also has a modern cryofacility using liquid nitrogen to store over 12,000 important plant and animal tissue samples as well as modern facilities for molecular work.\nRESEARCH\nStaff of the museum and their colleagues in Department of Biological Sciences of the National University of Singapore, as well as several government agencies actively conduct research in conservation biology, ecology, and systematics that covers many terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. Numerous surveys, expeditions and collaborative work are also conducted in the Asia-Pacific region with colleagues from Asia, Europe, Australia and the Americas.\nResearch strengths resident in the museum include systematics of many aquatic and terrstrial arthropods, molluscs, reptiles, amphibians and fish; as well as conservation of small mammals. More than 90% of the museum\u2019s specimens are used for research by academics, students and scientists from Singapore and the world; generating more than 70 scientific publications every year. Since the mid-1990s, the staff and students of the museum with its many associates have published between 1700-2000 scientific papers!\nA research room with laboratory facilities is available for visiting scientists at the museum. Bench fees are not normally levied since much of the work done with international organisations is of a collaborative nature. In addition to standard microscopes, the museum also has a radiography machine and a dedicated photography room.\nThe museum also leverages on the expertise of international and local colleagues who are not with the museum. These research friends have helped us become stronger as they complement us.\nOUTREACH AND EDUCATION\nThe museum offers a range of educational workshops and programmes for teachers and students of all levels in the area of natural history, conservation and ecology, leveraging on the museum\u2019s extensive knowledge base in biodiversity research. The approach of these workshops and programmes is interactive and stimulating, with cutting-edge content delivered through engaging hands-on experience.\nThe new galleries, together with a dedicated teaching laboratory and garden, are wonderful new resources that will take public education in LKCNHM to the next level. Adjacent to the main building is a single-storied teaching laboratory that can easily host more than a hundred students, and can be customised depending on the needs of the class \u2013 whether it is laboratory based or for lectures as a seminar room.\nPUBLICATIONS\nSince 1998, the museum has been actively publishing papers through its own dedicated organ, The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology (RBZ); as well as many educational books. The RBZ is a leading international, peer-reviewed journal focusing on Southeast Asian biodiversity that is in the Web of Science\u2019s Science Citation Index as well as many other indexing systems.\nOne of the few such journals in the region, it receives hundreds of submissions every year from around the world. The main journal has gone fully electronic since early 2014, expediting publication as well as saving costs. The RBZ also publishes thematic supplements, and although designed to be occasional, the numbers have been slowly increasing over the years.\nThe museum manages two other scientific publication. Nature in Singapore (NiS), an online peer-reviewed journal, publish papers on the natural history, biology, conservation, botany, zoology, and ecology of Singapore. Singapore Biodiversity Record (SBR) complements the NiS, providing a platform for the publication of short communications on previously unrecorded sightings of rare species of plants and animals. In addition, the museum publishes the peer-reviewed Lee Kong Chian Natural History Books (LKCNHMB) to share information pertaining to the biodiversity of Singapore, Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world. All our publications are open access and freely downloadable.\nDepending on funding and occasion, the LKCNHM also authors and/or publishes major books. These have included books on the Colugo, seashores and forests; the Private Lives Series of nature books on Singapore\u2019s habitats; as well as the landmark book \u201cSingapore Biodiversity \u2013 An Encyclopedia of the Natural Environment and Sustainable Development\u201d which became a bestseller.\nLIBRARY PUBLICATIONS\nA library contains a choice of literature including reference books, periodicals, journals and about 6,000 articles concerning materials in the museum. Although prior permission is required to access the library, a collection of about 10,000 zoological reference books and periodicals, as well as thousands of reprints originally form the Raffles Museum, is presently housed at the Science Library in NUS or hosted online .\nThe specimen catalogues of various floral and faunal groups in the museum have been maintained as handwritten entries in catalogue books. The catalogues are now currently being maintained digitally.\nParts of the reptile and amphibian collection is available online and searchable on Herpnet. The two moss databases available online are East Asian and Malesian. The next stage of the LKCNHM is currently in progress and will see the type collections digitised to modern standards and a basic databasing of the collections to facilitate their usage to the international community.\nSubscribe to our newsletter:\nFaculty of Science\n"

            "Natural history museum in  London\nNatural History Museum\nLocation\nThe Natural History Museum in London is a natural history museum that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of natural history . It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington , the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum . The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road .\nThe museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany , entomology , mineralogy , paleontology and zoology . The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy , identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin . The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture\u2014sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature\u2014both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling . The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world.\nAlthough commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum . The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections.\nLike other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. (It did but was scrapped in 2001) [2] The museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport . [3] Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge , is a patron of the museum. [4] There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group. [5]\nContents\nAn 1881 plan showing the original arrangement of the museum. This plan was re-drawn by Naama Ferstenfeld based on original plans in the museum's collection. The image is from Carla Yanni, Nature's Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Johns Hopkins UP, 2000.\nThe foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury , in 1756, which was the home of the British Museum .\nMost of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Dr George Shaw (Keeper of Natural History 1806\u201313) sold many specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons and had periodic cremations of material in the grounds of the museum. His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens. [6] In 1833, the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favouritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth. [7] [8] [ verification needed ]\nJ. E. Gray (Keeper of Zoology 1840\u201374) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the 12th edition of Linnaeus ' Systema Naturae ; another had removed all the labels and registration numbers from entomological cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the conchologist Hugh Cuming was acquired by the museum, and Gray's own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered. [9]\nThe Principal Librarian at the time was Antonio Panizzi ; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the museum's natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir Henry Ellis said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues.\nMany of these faults were corrected by the palaeontologist Richard Owen , appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led Bill Bryson to write that \"by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for\". [10]\nPlanning and architecture of new building[ edit ]\nThe Natural History Museum, shown in wide-angle view here, has an ornate terracotta facade by Gibbs and Canning Limited typical of high Victorian architecture . The terracotta mouldings represent the past and present diversity of nature.\nOwen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke , who died shortly afterwards. The scheme was taken over by Alfred Waterhouse who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the fa\u00e7ades in his own idiosyncratic Romanesque style which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent. [11] The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre.\nWork began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened in 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883.\nBoth the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of architectural terracotta tiles to resist the sooty atmosphere of Victorian London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of Gibbs and Canning Limited . The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of Darwin's attempt to link present species with past through the theory of natural selection . [12]\nThe central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of Imperial College London (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the Royal Albert Hall and Albert Memorial further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as Albertopolis .\nSeparation from the British Museum[ edit ]\nThe central hall of the museum\nEven after the opening, the Natural History Museum legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name British Museum (Natural History), usually abbreviated in the scientific literature as B.M.(N.H.). A petition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the Royal , Linnean and Zoological societies as well as naturalists including Darwin , Wallace and Huxley , asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the British Museum Act 1963 , the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own board of trustees, although \u2013 despite a proposed amendment to the act in the House of Lords \u2013 the former name was retained. In 1989 the museum publicly re-branded itself as the Natural History Museum and effectively stopped using the title British Museum (Natural History) on its advertising and its books for general readers. Only with the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 did the museum's formal title finally change to the Natural History Museum.\nIn 1976, the museum absorbed the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey , which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world's first computer-enhanced exhibition (Treasures of the Earth). The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as The Earth Galleries, with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled The Life Galleries. The Natural History Museum's own mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building.\nThe central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors' reluctance to visit the upper galleries by \"pulling\" them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The museum's 'star' geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures were the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth. These were later removed to make place for a Stegosaurus skeleton that was put on display in late 2015.\nThe Darwin Centre[ edit ]\nThe Darwin Centre (named after Charles Darwin ) was designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum's history.\nPhase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the zoological department's 'spirit collections'\u2014organisms preserved in alcohol . Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice C. F. M\u00f8ller Architects in the shape of a giant, eight-story cocoon and houses the entomology and botanical collections\u2014the 'dry collections'. [13] It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. [14]\nArguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long giant squid , affectionately named Archie. [15]\nThe Attenborough Studio[ edit ]\nAs part of the museum's remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio will form an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the BBC's Natural History Unit (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studio\u2014named after the broadcaster Sir David Attenborough \u2014provides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio holds regular lectures and demonstrations, including free Nature Live talks on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.\nMajor specimens and exhibits[ edit ]\nOne of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibits\u2014nicknamed \" Dippy \"\u2014is a 105-foot (32\u00a0m)-long replica of a Diplodocus carnegii skeleton which was on display for many years within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie , after a discussion with King Edward VII , then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie paid \u00a32,000 for the casting, copying the original held at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History . The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled to great public and media interest. The real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh was still being constructed to house it. As word of Dippy spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most major European capitals and in Latin and South America, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing .  After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the actual skeleton of a young blue whale , a 128-year-old skeleton nicknamed \"Hope\". [16] Dippy went on a tour of various British museums starting in 2018 and concluding in 2020 at Norwich Cathedral . [17] [18] [19]\nDippy in the Hintze Hall at the Natural History Museum in 2008\nThe blue whale skeleton, Hope, that has replaced Dippy, is another prominent display in the museum. The display of the skeleton, some 82 feet (25\u00a0m) long and weighing 4.5 tonnes, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the New Whale Hall (now the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour , Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers. [18] At this time, it was first displayed in the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery, but now takes pride of place in the museum's Hintze Hall. Discussion of the idea of a life-sized model also began around 1934, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed inside\u2014this soon growing to an urban myth that a time capsule was left inside. The work was completed\u2014entirely within the hall and in view of the public\u2014in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at 92 feet (28\u00a0m) in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with Hope was documented in a BBC Television special, Horizon : Dippy and the Whale, narrated by David Attenborough , which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before Hope was unveiled for public display. [20]\nA blue whale skeleton\u2014nicknamed \"Hope\"\u2014installed in Hintze Hall, 2017\nThe Darwin Centre is host to Archie , an 8.62-metre-long giant squid taken alive in a fishing net near the Falkland Islands in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items behind the scenes for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. [14] On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, \"wet storage\" was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45-metre acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to Damien Hirst ), and the body preserved using a mixture of formalin and saline solution .\nThe museum holds the remains and bones of the \" River Thames whale \", a northern bottlenose whale that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the Thames. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum's storage site at Wandsworth .\nDinocochlea , one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant gastropod shell , then a coprolite , and now a concretion of a worm's tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921.\nThe museum keeps a wildlife garden on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling Arocatus roeselii was discovered in 2007. [21]\nThe entrance to the Earth Galleries, designed by Neal Potter\nA balcony view of the Large Mammals Hall\nRed Zone\nThis is the zone that can be entered from Exhibition Road, on the East side of the building. It is a gallery themed around the changing history of the Earth.\nEarth's Treasury shows specimens of rocks, minerals and gemstones behind glass in a dimly lit gallery.

These include for example a highly praised \"How Science Works\" hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the Jurassic Coast of Devon and Dorset as a UNESCO World Heritage site and has subsequently been a lead partner in the Lyme Regis Fossil Festivals.\nIn 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including 'facsimiles' of luminaries such as Carl Linnaeus , Mary Anning , Dorothea Bate and William Smith . They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors. [22]\nIn 2010, a six-part BBC documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled Museum of Life exploring the history and behind the scenes aspects of the museum. [23]\nSince May 2001, the Natural History Museum admission has been free for some events and permanent exhibitions. However, there are certain temporary exhibits and shows that require a fee.\nThe Natural History museum combines the museum's life and earth science collections with specialist expertise in \"taxonomy, systematics, biodiversity, natural resources, planetary science, evolution and informatics\" to tackle scientific questions. [24] In 2011, the museum led the setting up of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, [25] to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria. [26] [27]\nThe closest London Underground station is South Kensington \u2014 there is a tunnel from the station that emerges close to the entrances of all three museums. Admission is free, though there are donation boxes in the foyer.\nA connecting bridge between the Natural History and Science museums closed to the public in the late 1990s.\nThe museum is a prominent setting in Charlie Fletcher 's children's book trilogy about \"unLondon\" called Stoneheart . George Chapman, the hero, sneaks outside when punished on a school trip; he breaks off a small dragon's stone head from a relief and is chased by a pterodactyl , which comes to life from a statue on the roof.\nThe museum is the primary setting for Rattle His Bones, the eighth Daisy Dalrymple Mystery by Carola Dunn . The story revolves around a murder and jewel theft occurring during the time Daisy Dalrymple is writing a story about the museum for an American publisher.\nThe museum plays an important role in the London-based Disney live-action feature One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing ; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid nannies hide inside the mouth of the museum's blue whale model (in fact a specially created prop \u2013 the nannies peer out from behind the whale's teeth, but a blue whale is a baleen whale and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the blue whale model was built.\nIn the 2014 film Paddington , the villain is Millicent Clyde a taxidermist at the museum. She kidnaps Paddington, intending to kill and stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and on the roof of the building. [29]\nIn the first episode of the third season of the TV series Penny Dreadful (2014\u20132016), the main character, Vanessa Ives ( Eva Green ), visits the museum after her psychotherapist tells her to \"go somewhere different\". There, she meets Dr. Alexander Sweet ( Christian Camargo ), who is a zoologist and the Director of Zoological Studies. The museum is frequently seen in the following episodes as Vanessa and Dr. Sweet's relationship flourishes.\nNatural History Museum at Tring[ edit ]\n.\nGunther, Albert E. (1975).

The toys and items hail from over 40 countries and range in date from the 1840s to 1970s. These are displayed across the rooftop, basement and 4 thematic levels of the museum: Outerspace, Characters, Childhood Favourites and Collectables.\nThe collection is made up of various key collections, including Batman, Dan Dare, Japanese character and space-related toys, and collectables. In addition to toys, the museum houses a collection of confectionary vintage tin boxes, large-item displays, such as Mobo horses and pedal cars, as well as original enamel advertising signs. Over the years, these have been incorporated into various exhibitions and programmes run by the museum, serving as windows into the past as well as inspirations for the present.\nToday, MINT Museum of Toys serves diverse and expanding audiences, including tourists, families, collectors, artists and students. It continues to fascinate and inspire the imaginations of audiences, taking them to on a journey of rediscovery to rekindle that Moment of Imagination and Nostalgia with Toys (MINT).\nHistory\nThe museum began as an idea in the mind of founding CEO, Mr Chang Yang Fa. Driven by his passion for design and the arts, Mr Chang, who is an avid toy collector, imagined a space that is devoted to presenting vintage toys and childhood memorabilia \u2013 a space where visitors can also rediscover the past and revisit wonderful childhood memories.\nWhen Mr Chang founded MINT Museum of Toys in 2007, it was the first museum in the world known to be purpose-built for toys, and to date, it remains to be the only one. MINT was envisioned to be a world-class toy museum, with the objective of reaching out to the child in each and every person. Today, it continues to promote that belief.\nThe building was also conceptualized to be a space that would provide visitors with a holistic experience. In 2007, the retail space, MINT Shop, and the dining space opened alongside the museum, promoting both the spirit of imagination and nostalgia. Later in 2015, the dining space evolved to become Mr Punch Public House, a gastrobar serving modern European cuisine. The name took inspiration from the museum\u2019s collection of Punch & Judy puppets. The space doubles also as an enamel sign gallery.\nBuilding\nDesigned by world-renowned firm, SCDA Architects, the building was built specifically to accommodate the collection.\nThe facade was designed to exclude external lighting that could potentially damage the exhibits. It is also one of the iconic features of the building;\u00a0made up of twenty-six glass panels shaped into a wave-like structure, the facade lends fluidity and movement to the building.\nAwards\nCityscape Dubai Architectural Review Awards, 2006\nBest New Global Design,\nWinner in the category of the Tourism, Travel and Transport,\nCityscape Dubai Architectural Awards, 2008\nTeam\nMINT Museum of Toys houses a world-class collection of vintage toys and collectable items in an international award-winning contemporary building on 26 Seah Street.\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nShare this article:\nInvestigating the culturally rich city of Seoul , we list 10\u00a0established museums located within a city marked with a fascinating past. With a variety\u00a0of museums that display the nation\u2019s history from the prehistoric era to the present day, Seoul is where Korea\u2019s traditional and modern cultures coexist.\nNational Palace Museum of Korea\nScattered within 40 kilometers of Seoul are the famous 40 Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty , the longest ruling Confucian dynasty spanning five centuries from 1392 to 1897. Much of the history of the dynasty can be explored at The National Palace Museum of Korea , where one can view artefacts in an extensive collection consisting of more than 40,000 items. The permanent collection covers all aspects of the Joseon lifestyle, including the art, science and music of the period. The museum also hosts special temporary exhibitions and education programs for English speakers.\nThe National Museum of Korea\nLocated in Yongsan, in the heart of Seoul, The National Museum of Korea is a cultural complex that not only preserves and displays relics but also hosts a variety of programs, such as the Children\u2019s Museum and other cultural events linked to its exhibitions. More than 220,000 collections are on display, spanning from ancient and medieval history, to early modern history, focusing on calligraphy and painting, sculpture and crafts, and much more. The museum also holds international artefacts from places such as India, Southeast Asia , Central Asia, China and Japan . The museum is located in the center of the Yongsan Family Park facing the Han River , with the impressive Mt. Namsan standing behind it.\nPulmuone Kimchi Museum\nThe Pulmuone Kimchi Museum is a unique way to discover the tradition of kimchi, a staple of Korea. This is a fermented food prepared by mixing and ripening brined cabbage or radish with seasonings such as red pepper powder, spring onion and garlic. Since opening in 1986, the museum has acted as a cultural and educational space that promotes this Korean icon. The museum is located in the Korea World Trade Centre in Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu.\nEwha Womans University Natural History Museum\nThe Ewha Womans University Natural History Museum is the first established natural history museum in Korea, and was opened in 1969. The collections include specimens of Korean natural monuments, internationally protected birds, and species that are endemic, rare, or newly discovered. The grounds of the Ewha Womans University, one of the top ten universities in Korea, are also a recommended visit, featuring impressive architecture and picturesque scenery. The nearby University Museum has one of the National Treasures of South Korea on display: number 107 of 315, the White Porcelain Jar with Grapevine Design.\nThe National Folk Museum of Korea\nThe National Folk Museum of Korea is dedicated to presenting the traditional ways of life of the Korean people, starting from prehistory to how they live today. Opened in 1945, the museum has been hosting special exhibitions including the Korean Annual Traditional Handicraft Art Exhibition and the Artisans of Korean Traditional Skills Exhibition. The open-air exhibition in the front gardens of the museum offers diverse themes of Korean folk life, further illustrating traditional rural culture. Noteworthy artefacts are the Jangseung spirit posts to which villagers prayed in an attempt to prevent calamity and to bring a successful harvest.\nCheongGyeCheon Museum\nThe CheongGyeCheon Museum is dedicated to the story behind the Cheonggyecheon water course, a major stream that ran through Seoul\u2019s downtown area long before the city was made the capital of Joseon. Part of the Seoul Museum of History , the museum is the result of the Cheonggyecheon restoration project. This restoration was a major part of the development of Seoul, and since its completion in 2005 its surrounding areas have constantly changed and evolved. The museum explains the history and significance of Cheonggyecheon, the problems related to the stream, and the solutions to such issues from the conversations of Kings Taejong, Sejong, Yeongjo, and Jeongjo of Joseon.\nA flood in 1925 resulted in the discovery of the largest Neolithic site found in South Korea. These 6000-year-old artifacts have been turned into a museum where visitors can experience a recreation of life in the prehistoric village. Neolithic remains from the site include comb pattern pottery and stone tools such as axes, arrowheads, scrapers and fishing net weights. There were also acorns and grinding stones found as well as hand-held ploughs and stone scythes. These remains indicate that hunting, gathering and developing agriculture were all practiced at Amsa-dong during the fourth millennium BC.\nCheongwadae Sarangchae\nTo learn about Korea\u2019s past, specifically about the culture and political history of its capital, Cheongwadae Sarangchae is a recommended visit. Known as the presidential museum of South Korea, the museum also promotes the image of a high-tech Korea, offering creative and unique experiences through interactive devices. Opened in January 2010, the two-story exhibition and museum space were designed to be more environmentally friendly, embracing the power of solar and geothermal energy. Reducing the use of fossil fuels is a fitting response to Korea\u2019s ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent by the year 2020.\nLeeum Samsung Museum of Art\nRun by the Samsung Foundation of Culture, The Leeum Samsung Museum of Art houses an extensive collection of traditional and contemporary art, by both national and international artists. The name Leeum is from the family name of its founder, Hoam Lee Byung-chul, who was also the founder of Samsung and is a keen art collector. The buildings of the museum were designed by the internationally renowned architects Mario Botta , Jean Nouvel and Rem Koolhaas , their designs combining the past, present and future of art and culture.\nThe popular T.um: Telecom Ubiquitous Museum is situated in the impressive T Tower in the Uljiro district of Seoul. This museum presents the developing technology of Korea, and speculations on what the future may hold. Each exhibit in the museum features smart phone interactions, which are given to every visitor. Examples of this include a shopping section, where one can take pictures of commercials on TV using their smart phone and instantly buy the item they are advertising. Another highlights the process of transforming an already existing 2D film into 3D.\n"

            "Sauna and Jacuzzi\nOf all the relaxation techniques that people use, one of the most enduring is the power of heat. Warm water baths were used during Roman\u00a0times to help relax and heal people. Today, we use the power of heat in therapeutic settings such as jacuzzis and saunas. Both of these\u00a0apparatuses have several benefits associated with their use.Heat has long been used in physiotherapy as a means to relax and help heal muscles. The heat which the jacuzzi or sauna generates is no\u00a0different, but it works on a much larger scale.

            "(October 2015)\nJjimjilbang room\nA jjimjilbang (\nKorean pronunciation:\n[t\u0348\u0255imd\u0291ilba\u014b] ; Korean : \ucc1c\uc9c8\ubc29; Hanja : \ucc1c\uc9c8\u623f; MR : tchimjilbang, lit. 'Steamed-quality room') is a large, sex-segregated public bathhouse in South Korea , furnished with hot tubs , showers, Korean traditional kiln saunas and massage tables. Jjimjil is derived from the words meaning heating. In other areas of the building or on other floors there are unisex areas, usually with a snack bar, ondol -heated floor for lounging and sleeping, wide-screen TVs, exercise rooms, ice rooms, heated salt rooms, PC bang , noraebang , and sleeping quarters with bunk beds or sleeping mats. [1] Many of the sleeping rooms have themes or elements to them. Usually jjimjilbangs will have various rooms with temperatures to suit guests' preferred relaxing temperatures. [2] The walls are decorated with woods, minerals, crystals, stones, and metals to make the ambient mood and smell more natural. The elements used have traditional Korean medicinal purposes in the rooms. [3]\nMost jjimjilbangs are open 24 hours and are a popular weekend getaway for South Korean families. During the week, many hardworking South Korean men, whose families live out of the city for cost savings, stay in jjimjilbangs overnight after working or drinking with co-workers late into the night. The cost is around 8,000-12,000 won to enter, and one can sleep overnight and enjoy the bathhouse and sauna. [4]\nContents\nHanjeungmak ( Hangul : \ud55c\uc99d\ub9c9, Hanja : \u6c57\u84b8\u5e55) is Korean traditional sauna . Intensely hot and dry, it uses traditionally burning wood of pine to heat a domelike kiln made of stone. Nowadays, hanjeungmaks are incorporated into jjimjilbang rather than being independent facilities. Bulgama installed in jjimjilbang is a variety of hanjeungmak, heated with higher temperature. Sometimes the dome-shaped walls of kiln rooms are plastered with loam , salt, minerals.\nThe first mention of hanjeungmak, initially referred to as Hanjeungso ( Korean : \ud55c\uc99d\uc18c, Hanja : \u6c57\u84b8\u6240), is found in the Annals of Sejong in the 15th century. [5] [6] The record also states that the Korean kiln saunas were used for medicinal purposes. At that time, hanjeungmaks were state-supported kiln saunas maintained by Buddhist monks. Since 1429, the saunas were constructed separating facilities for men and women. [7] There are a picture painted by Kim Jun geun in the 19th century depicting a hanjeungmak and its circular wall made from bricks accompanied by a bath house.\nJjimjilbangs usually operate 24 hours a day. In the entrance, there are the doors labelled \u201cmen\u201d or \u201cwomen\u201d and shoes are to be stored using a given key. Once inside, the shoe locker key is exchanged with another locker key to store clothes and belongings. Afterwards bathers walk into the gender-segregated bathhouse area (children of both genders below seven years of age are free to intermingle) and take a shower. Then, one should wear the jjimjilbang clothes (usually a T-shirt and shorts, color-coordinated according to gender), which are received with the locker key.\nIn the bathing areas, there are kiln saunas with themes including a jade, a salt, or mineral kiln: the dome-shaped inside the kilns are plastered with jade powder, salt and mineral respectively.\nOften there are several kilns with temperatures ranging from 16 to 49\u00a0\u00b0C (60 to 120\u00a0\u00b0F). [8] The temperature of the kilns is displayed on a sign at the entrance.\nJjimjilbangs are kept in a very sanitary condition for the health of patrons, and most are cleaned continuously. No harsh chemicals are used in the waters or saunas.[ citation needed ]\nBut there were cases to be detected with molds or athletes foot germs during the hygiene checking, and also the cases of receiving administrative measure due to the foods over the expiry date. [9] [10] Currently, health control standards are forced to be followed according to Public Health Control Act. [11] Yet, it is better to avoid the patients with cold or fever, or poor general condition.\nAll wet areas prohibit the use of clothing for safety reasons. With the extreme heat of the baths and steam rooms, it is believed that toxic chemicals can leach out of apparel and into the body. It is also believed that if you wear a swimsuit or cover up you may be trying to hide a disease.[ citation needed ]\nRecently, the hygienic quality and healthiness of some jjimjilbangs were questioned, especially the proper washing of clothing provided by the jjimjilbangs. Concerns about the clothes increasing atopy symptoms in patients, or even of accidentally hosting parasites, were voiced, although the evidence was inconclusive. [12]\nTheft, usually of smartphones, is occasionally a problem at some jimjilbangs. [13]\nEffect on the human body[ edit ]\nThis article may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards . The specific problem is: Very bad pidgin English, written by a non-native speaker. Please help improve this article if you can.\n(November 2019)\n(Experimental group mainly was elderly people)\nThe temperature of the rectum which is closely related to the body temperature has raised slowly before the Jjimjil.

            "12/3/2019\nThe traditional Javanese lulur or massage is a royal ritual used to purify and soften the skin. It originally began in the palaces of Yogyakarta around the 18th century, when brides prepared their skin for their wedding night by completing the ritual every day for 40 days. What was once exclusive to royalty can now be found in spas all over Indonesia and even abroad. Taman Sari Royal Heritage Spa in Prague, Czech Republic, beautifully represents the Javanese culture through its intricate traditional designs and truly authentic spa rituals.\nBuilt in the mid-18th century, Taman Sari is the name of a former royal garden of the Sultanate of Yogkyakarta. It had multiple functions and four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions, a bathing area, a complex of pavilions and pools, and a smaller lake. This was the main inspiration of this incredible spa located right in the middle of Europe.\nDesigned by TMS Creative (PT. Talenta Multikreasi Sejahtera), this project had the challenge of translating traditional Javanese elements into a modern approach. It was important to incorporate tradition, heritage and nature into a Royal Javanese spa experience whilst using modern technology in its construction and design in order to fit into the international market.\nWater is traditionally believed to be a means of purification for ritual ceremonies, which is why water was highlighted as an essential element within the space. The various effects of nature expressed in this historic place was believed to help people to balance their jiwa raga sukma (mind, body, and soul). This concept was adapted into the spa, where visitors can experience a unique atmosphere influenced by the familiarity of elements and spatial layout found in traditional Javanese houses. The interior design explores current trends which is perfectly juxtaposed with the cultural elements of the Javanese heritage in order to create a relaxing royal spa experience.\nTraditional patterns were incorporated into the design using  modern applications such as resin technology, laser cutting and woodworking machinery. These methods were chosen for its precise and sleek finish while maintaining the pattern\u2019s materiality and authentic look.  A harmonious colour scheme and careful selection of materials were integrated to give the essence of natural balance. Wood is the most important element, as it signifies nature and heritage. The continuous spatial sequence in the spa was derived from the beauty ritual of the Javanese Royal Family, which  authentically reflects the Javanese culture and its traditional homes, also called Joglo .\nThe lobby emanates grandeur, with four columns in the middle of the room that serve as the focal point of the space. These four columns were inspired by Soko Guru or master pillars in the centre of Joglo houses which is the roof\u2019s main structure. This wooden frame structure is tied to a set of wooden beams known as Tumpangasari beams. The Tumpangsari are usually composed of three to five layers of interconnected beams. The layers are always in odd numbers because it is considered good fortune in Javanese culture.\nTaman Sari Royal Heritage Spa perfectly recreates the beauty of the Javanese culture, from its layout, to its choice of treatments and all the way to the intricate wood carvings found throughout the space. It is a great representation of Indonesia, and it proudly stands out among other establishments found in Prague. With every visit, guests can experience a truly authentic Javanese ritual.\nLike this story, share to your friends\nTHIS STORY WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN\n"

be it at the Pilates Reformer, Mat work or using specific auxiliary Pilates equipment - to target your postures, movement and chronic pains and concerns but in a group setting.\nPre and Post Natal\u00a0Pilates Classes\nThe Pilates Work\u2122 offers pre-natal and post-natal Pilates classes by certified Pre-and-Postpartum\u00a0Pilates instructors.\nWe do not advocate synchronised pre-natal classes like other studios as mommies-to-be at different trimesters demand particular\u00a0Pilates exercises and fitness objectives for their best optimum care.\nMommies-to-be can choose to join private Pilates classes or Pre-natal Customised Group Pilates classes where the dedicated instructor can continue to focus on your own trimester fitness needs and concerns such as lower back aches and neck pains. \u00a0The instructor will also share where you\u00a0should focus on during the respective trimester and simple exercises to do at home.\nAfter delivery, new mommies can choose to join our private Pilates classes or post-natal Customised Group Pilates classes. \u00a0Again, this allows us to work through to your optimal recovery post-delivery based on your delivery profile (natural or C-section), breast-feeding and baby-carrying strengthening\u00a0postures, and address your particular post-delivery concerns such as diastasis, wrist pain, and poor hip alignment.\nSeniors Pilates Classes\nThe Pilates Works\u2122 has specialised classes for seniors.\u00a0 The key purpose is to improve quality of life by helping our class participants regain mobility, improve balance and flexibility, sensory functionality as well as overcome postural challenges.\nThe class is conducted in smaller group size (5-6 persons).\u00a0 Everyone follows the sequence of movements at an appropriate pace.\u00a0 However, each movement is adjusted and customised to individual, depending on their needs and problems. Our clients often have knee problems and pain,\u00a0 inability to squat and knee down, shoulder and back aches that we help them with during the class.\nThe class is conducted by the more experienced instructors, who have been trained to work with equipment and props to cater to declined tactile sensory ability.\u00a0 We focus particularly on mind-body coordination to help mature participants build concentration and presence of mind.\u00a0 This greatly reduces fall risks as well as increased reaction ability to break their falls, which is top concern for the mature population.\nby Collin Low\nCollin Low is the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pilates Master Teacher Alvin Giam (1955-2015) who single-handedly started the pilates movement in Singapore and Asia. \u00a0His Pilates Bodyworks was the first pilates studio in Singapore. \u00a0The late Master Alvin studied with Joseph Pilates's students\u00a0Pilates elders Mary Bowen and Ron Fletcher as well as the 1st and 2nd generation students of Pilates elders\u00a0Eve Gentry, Diane Miller, Michele Larsson and Pat Guyton. \u00a0Collin was schooled and groomed under the careful tutorship of Master Alvin for close to a decade.\nCollin ran the Bodyworks almost as long as it has been there with Alvin. \u00a0Post Alvin's passing, Collin transited and continued Alvin's legacy under The Pilates Works.

            "10 Yoga Poses You Need to Know\nThe building blocks of yoga are poses. These are good ones to learn as you build a regular yoga practice.\nThese 10 poses are a complete yoga workout. Move slowly through each pose, remembering to breathe as you move. Pause after any pose you find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start again when your breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next one.\nChild's Pose\nThis calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child\u2019s pose to rest and refocus before continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, thighs, knees and ankles and relaxes your spine, shoulders and neck.\nDo it: When you want to get a nice gentle stretch through your neck spine and hips.\nSkip it: If you have knee injuries or ankle problems. Avoid also if you have high blood pressure or are pregnant.\nModify: You can rest your head on a cushion or block. You can place a rolled towel under your ankles if they are uncomfortable.\nBe mindful: Focus on relaxing the muscles of the spine and lower back as you breathe.\nChild\u2019s Pose\nThis should be your go-to pose whenever you need to rest for a moment during a yoga workout.\nTry It!\nDownward-Facing Dog\nDownward-facing dog strengthens the arms, shoulders and back while stretching the hamstrings, calves and arches of your feet. It can also help relieve back pain.\nDo it: To help relieve back pain.\nSkip it: This pose is not recommended if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist problems, have high blood pressure or are in the late stages of pregnancy.\nModify: You can do the pose with your elbows on the ground, which takes the weight off your wrists. You can also use blocks under your hands, which may feel more comfortable.\nBe mindful: Focus on distributing the weight evenly through your palms and lifting your hips up and back, away from your shoulders.\nDownward-Facing Dog\nTry it!\nPlank Pose\nA commonly seen exercise, plank helps build strength in the core, shoulders, arms and legs.\nDo it: Plank pose is good if you are looking to tone your abs and build strength in your upper body.\nSkip it: Avoid plank pose if you suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.

If a pose causes pain or proves too difficult, there are variations and modifications that can be made to help students. Props like blocks, blankets and straps \u2014 even chairs \u2014 can be used to help you get the most benefit from the poses. Yoga is not one-size-fits-all: The best yoga workout for you will depend on your individual needs and goals.\nThe benefits of a regular yoga practice are wide-ranging. In general, a complete yoga workout can help keep your back and joints healthy, improve your overall posture, stretch and strengthen muscles and improve your balance, says Roger Cole, Ph.D., a psychobiologist and certified Iyengar yoga teacher. Yoga also has \u201ca restorative side that is deeply relaxing and rejuvenating,\u201d Dr. Cole says. \u201cRelaxation is built into every yoga session.\u201d\nIn addition, yoga\u2019s focus on the breath can calm you and help you learn to be more mindful of your body, says Dr. Timothy McCall, the author of \u201cYoga as Medicine,\u201d and that can help you to move with greater ease.\nIn recent years, more and more research is demonstrating the wide-ranging health benefits of yoga.\nStudies show that yoga can help:\nReduce back pain:\nyoga practitioners were shown to have increased bone density in their spine and hips, compared to people in a control group.\nImprove balance: Male athletes\nStave off mental decline:\nReduce stress: A\nRelieve depression: In\nAncient, But Not Foreign\nYoga is tied to ancient Indian philosophy, so yoga poses have both Sanskrit and English names \u2014 adho mukha svanasana is more commonly known as downward-facing dog, for example \u2014 and you may hear both in a class.\nBut even if you have never tried a yoga class, you may already be familiar with some yoga poses. Ever tried a plank? You\u2019ve done yoga.\nTrainers and fitness classes around the world, not to mention college and professional sports teams, are including yoga into more traditional workouts as a potent form of mind-body conditioning, helping athletes to breathe better and increase their focus.\nThe\n\u201cThe attention-focusing and alignment-honing potential of a yoga practice is a solid complement to more athletic, explosive and calisthenic endeavors,\u201d says Derek Cook, a former personal trainer who teaches yoga.\nYoga and Meditation\nBefore yoga was a popular physical exercise, it was, for thousands of years, mainly a meditation practice.\nMindfulness with Yoga\nIn a yoga class, as you learn to do yoga poses, you will be instructed to notice your breath and the way your body moves during the exercises. The is the foundation of a mind-body connection.\nA well-balanced series of yoga exercises gives you the opportunity to scan your entire body, noting how you feel as you move through the poses. You may begin to realize, for example, that one side of your body feels different than the other during a stretch, or that it\u2019s easier to balance on your right leg, or that certain poses helps ease tension in your neck.\nThis is how yoga turns physical exercises into tools to help students become more mindful and even learn to meditate.\nStephen Cope, who teaches yoga and mindfulness at Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Massachusetts has written that learning to focus in this way can help us outside of yoga class, too. \u201cAs we train our attention, we\u2019ll begin to notice our postures throughout the day, not just on the yoga mat,\u201d Mr.Cope writes in his book \u201cYoga and the Quest for the True Self.\u201d\nLearning to be aware of your posture at your desk or when you walk, for example, can be the first step to making improvements that will make you move more easily and feel better all the time.\nRelated Guide\nThe Breath\nBreathing techniques are an essential part of yoga \u2014 not only do they help you to stay focused while practicing yoga, they can also help reduce stress and relax the nervous system and calm the mind.\nYoga breathing techniques also offer a \u201c way into meditation,\u201d says Elena Brower, a yoga and meditation teacher and the author of \u201c\n.\u201d Ms. Brower says that more people who have in recent years focused on the physical aspects of yoga are moving toward meditation, as they find \u201cthey have an increasing need to have time to reflect, release and recalibrate.\u201d\nHere are a few types of breathing techniques that may be included in a yoga class:\nAbdominal Breathing: Also called diaphragmatic or belly breathing, this is the most common breathing technique you\u2019ll find in basic yoga. It helps foster healthy, efficient breathing in general.\nTry it:\nInflate your abdomen as you inhale.\nExhale, trying to empty your abdomen of as much air as you can.\nUjjayi or \u201cvictorious\u201d breath: This type of deep breathing allows you to slow and smooth the flow of breath. It is often used in flow classes to help students regulate their breathing as they move through the poses.\nTry it:\nConstrict the muscles in the back of your throat and breathe in and out with your mouth closed.\nSome say this breathing technique sounds like Darth Vader; others say it sounds like the ocean. In any case, the sound should be audible to you only; your neighbor doesn\u2019t necessarily need to hear it.\nInterval or interrupted breathing: In this type of breathing, the student is instructed to pauses and hold the breath during the inhalation or exhalation, or both. It is a good way to begin to learn to control the breath, especially if you are looking to try more advance yoga breathing techniques.\nTry it:\nInhale fully.\nPause.\nPause.\nRepeat.\nIf you like, you can then do a couple rounds of interrupted breathing during exhalation.\nAlternate nostril breathing: This technique is said to be effective in balancing the nervous system and is a good idea to try before meditation\nTry it:\nHold one nostril closed and inhale through the open nostril.\nExhale through the open nostril.\nSwitch your hands and block the open nostril, releasing the closed nostril.\nInhale through the open nostril and exhale.\nRepeat several times.\nMore about mindfulness\nYou don\u2019t need anything to start a yoga practice, but here\u2019s what you may want as you progress.\nNo Sock, No Shoes, No Problem\nYoga is generally practiced in bare feet on a mat. Socks are slippery, which is why wearing them is not recommended. If you really want to wear socks, look for sports socks that have rubber grips on the soles.\nYoga Mats\nMost yoga studios and gyms offer mats, but many yoga students prefer to buy a mat, for hygiene and because mats differ in material, density and stickiness. You may find you develop a strong preference for a certain type of mat.\nChoose a mat that prevents you from slipping and sliding, as that will give you a stable base for transitioning from one pose to the next. Clean your mat regularly with antibacterial wipes. If you plan to rent mats at your studio or gym, it would be a good idea to carry around a small packet of antibacterial wipes to clean your rental mat.\nIf you are looking to buy your own yoga mat, The Wirecutter, a website owned by The New York Times Company,\nClothes\nComfortable clothing is recommended. Any workout clothes would generally work well for a yoga class. However, clothing that is too loose-fitting may get in the way if you progress into headstand and handstand poses.\nGet the Well Newsletter\nGet the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox every week.\nYour email address\nSign up now\nBeginning a Yoga Practice\nIf you want to reap the full benefits of yoga, it\u2019s important to find a way to make it a regular part of your routine.\nCreating a Habit\nThe most important thing to remember when starting a yoga practice (or any new health habit) is that the key to success is doing it routinely. Start small and manageable, says Dr. McCall. Ten or 15 minutes a day of yoga may be more valuable than going to one class a week. \u201cI would rather have a student succeed at doing a one-minute-a-day practice, than fail at doing a five-minute-a-day practice,\u201d says Dr. McCall.\nHopefully, as you begin to see the benefits of your daily practice, however short, chances are you will be convinced to do more.\nFind a Class\nYoga can be done at home, but \u2014 especially for the beginner \u2014 it is important to try a class or two that is taught by a seasoned instructor, in a private or group setting, to be sure you are doing the yoga exercises safely.\nLook for an experienced yoga instructor who has at least a 200-hour teaching certificate from a teacher-training program accredited with the Yoga Alliance. Those programs include training on injury prevention. If you have any specific medical concerns, check with a doctor before beginning to see what types of yoga might be best for you.\nLook for yoga studios or gyms that provide good slip-resistant mats (if you are planning on renting a mat) and sturdy, clean blocks for support. If you do rent a mat, make sure there is antibacterial spray or cloths available for you to wipe down your mat before and after use.\nRelated Guide\nWhat Class is Right for Me?\nThere are many styles of yoga classes taught today. Some are very physically challenging and will leave you sweating; others are gentle and restorative. Some teachers play music in class; others don\u2019t. Some classes include references to yoga philosophy and spirituality; others don\u2019t.\nHere are a few types of classes your yoga studio or gym may offer:\nHatha: Most yoga styles being taught in America today are a form of hatha yoga, which is a general term that refers to the physical part of yoga, rather than yoga philosophy or meditation. A Hatha yoga class is likely to be a combination of poses and breathing exercises, but it\u2019s hard to know whether it will be challenging or gentle. Check with the school or the teacher to find more about the level of classes that are described only as Hatha yoga.\nAshtanga Yoga: This is a challenging style of yoga that is centered around a progressive series of yoga sequences that, traditionally, students practice on their own under the guidance of a teacher. If you think that yoga is not a workout, you haven\u2019t tried an Ashtanga class. Classes include advanced poses such as arm balances and inversions including headstands and shoulder stands. Beginner students are strongly advised to study with an experienced teacher. Ashtanga classes will also often include teachings in yoga philosophy.\nPower Yoga: As its name suggests, power yoga is a challenging style of yoga aimed at strength-building. These classes will include advanced poses and inversions like headstands and handstands that require a lot of strength.\nVinyasa or Flow: These classes usually consist of a fairly energetic flowing sequence of yoga poses that will include \u2014 depending on the level \u2014 advanced poses, such as arm balances, headstands, shoulder stands and handstands. Many vinyasa classes have musical accompaniment of the teacher\u2019s choosing.\nIyengar: Love learning about how your muscles and joints work together? This is the yoga for you. Iyengar yoga focuses on the precision of your yoga poses. Iyengar classes are known for their use of props, including blankets, blocks, straps and bolsters, to help students do poses that they wouldn\u2019t be able to do otherwise. Classes can also include ropes that are anchored to the walls to do inversions and other poses. They also tend to include breathing exercises and references to yoga philosophy.\nBikram or Hot Yoga: Like the heat? Bikram yoga is a set series of 26 poses performed in a room heated to 105 degrees, which is said to allow for deeper stretching and provide for a better cardiovascular workout. Unlike most yoga classes, Bikram classes are always done in rooms with mirrors. Hot yoga refers to any yoga class that is done in a heated room \u2014 generally from 80 to 100 degrees.\nRestorative Yoga: If you are looking for a little more relaxation from your yoga class, restorative yoga is for you. This yoga style usually involves a few restful poses that are held for long periods of time. Restorative poses include light twists, seated forward folds and gentle back-bends, usually done with the assistance of many props, including blankets, blocks and bolsters.\nYin Yoga: Looking for a new kind of stretching experience? Yin yoga is aimed at stretching the connective tissue around the pelvis, sacrum, spine and knees to promote flexibility. Poses are held for a longer amount of time in yin yoga classes, generally from three to five minutes. It is a quiet style of yoga, and will quickly show you how good you are at sitting still.\nNote: It\u2019s a good idea to try several yoga classes. How much you enjoy any class will come down to how much you like the teacher, not how it\u2019s labeled.\nClass Etiquette\nYoga students are expected to be on time to class and respectful of one another. Crowded classes can mean that students will be aligned mat-to-mat, so don\u2019t assume that you will have a lot of room around you for personal belongings. Most yoga classrooms have shelves for your valuables, drinks and other personal items. Remember to turn your cellphone off before class.\nFor Bikram or hot yoga classes, bring a towel. You are going to sweat, and it will help prevent slipping.\nClasses usually begin with a brief introduction by the teacher that may include a focus or theme for the day, such as backbends or particular poses, and then the teacher often will instruct the class to chant the word \u201cOm\u201d together. (Om is a Sanskrit term that connotes the connectivity of all things in the universe.)\nTo \u201cOm\u201d or not to \u201cOm\u201d? There is no obligation to chant, but you should at least remain quiet during that time.\nSome breathing techniques taught in yoga classes are meant to be loud and others are not. Students should take cues from the teacher.\nIf you have to leave early, try to tell the teacher ahead of time, and, if you can, position yourself near the back of the room and leave before the relaxation period at the end of class.\nA note to the over-achiever: Trying too hard often leads to injury. Being aware of your physical limitations and when you need to modify a pose will be more beneficial to your body than reaching to be the most flexible or strongest in the class.\nMore on Beginning a Yoga Practice\nYoga Online\nCan\u2019t make it to yoga class regularly? Prefer to practice yoga at home? No problem. Yoga can come to you, online.\nFinding an App\nThere are a dizzying array of apps and streaming sites available for yoga: for the office, on a plane, in bed and just about anywhere else. There are apps for breathing exercises, yoga philosophy and anatomy for the yoga student. They cater to the curvy, the runner, the veteran, the child, the health-care provider and everyone else. Here are a few good options to explore:\nStill want more?\n, started in 1975 by a group of yoga teachers from California, is one of the most comprehensive online yoga sites available.

            "Best nightclubs in Kuala Lumpur\nFood and shopping isn\u2019t the only thing we Singaporeans head over to Malaysia for \u2013 there\u2019s also the city of Kuala Lumpur for a clubbing fix at more affordable prices, thanks to the sweet exchange rate. Although Malaysia\u2019s capital is smaller than Singapore, it\u2019s rich in nightlife, with lots of pubs and clubs to hype your nights up.\nHere\u2019s a list of the most happening nightclubs in KL so you can jump straight into the action after a short bus ride across the border.\nTREC\nTREC is a relatively new area within the city dedicated to nightlife establishments, with a good view of the Petronas Twin Towers in the distance. You needn\u2019t worry about safety here as tight security in each club ensures order throughout the night.\n1. Artebar \u2013 where vibrant art and clubbing come together\nImage adapted from: @artebartrec\nTo prove its namesake, Artebar proudly shows off its DC Comics artwork hanging from its ceiling above patrons as DJs spin alternative hip-hop. Matching its vibrant interior is a selection of European-inspired Asian culinary choices that are just as novel, such as dishes like Spicy Beef Salad (RM26).\nMany come by for its unique drinks too, like the Martini Tiramisu (RM15) and Grand Sour (RM26) that\u2019s brandy mixed with orange juice, sweet and sour punch and egg white.\nCover charge (1st floor only): Males Wed 11PM onwards RM30 | Fri RM40 | Sat RM30\nAddress: 436 Jalan Tun Razak, E-G-03 E-1-03 Electric Boulevard, TREC, 50400 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Mon \u2013 Sun 5PM \u2013 3AM\nAttica frequenters may feel a tinge of familiarity when visiting Le Noir, as they\u2019re managed by the same group. Le Noir also has a couple of floors with different concepts on each to cater to varying nightlife tastes.\nRegardless of whether you prefer to sing along to live performances on the ground floor, dance away to hip-hop and house music in the lush club-lounge on the 2nd, or lepak on the roof with a cocktail, you won\u2019t feel stuffy due to the airy open layout.\nCover charge:\nFri \u2013 Sat RM40 (club and roof) 11PM onwards (includes 1 free drink)\nAddress: H-G-07 The Hive, TREC, Jalan Tun Razak 50400 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Sun \u2013 Thu 5PM \u2013 3AM | Fri \u2013 Sat 5PM \u2013 5AM\nPetronas Twin Towers\nEven though this iconic building is no longer the world\u2019s tallest building, it\u2019ll still allow you to catch a bird\u2019s eye view of the city as you\u2019re partying!\n3. Kyo \u2013 Happy Hour with 1-for-1 housepours\nImage adapted from: @keepcarmm\nWhile Kyo in Singapore has closed for over a year now, Kyo KL carries the same upscale vibe and tasteful house playlists as its bygone Singaporean sibling. Nevertheless, its graffitied hallway is easily distinguishable from the rest of the towers\u2019 sophisticated steel and glass interior, making the club easy to find.\nAs it\u2019s situated in Mandarin Oriental hotel within the Petronas Twin Towers, Kyo\u00a0KL is flocked to by clubbers all around the world so perhaps you\u2019ll make a few international friends here. Happy hour takes place between 5PM \u2013 12MN with 1-for-1 promos on housepours and a complimentary bottle with every 2 purchased.\nCover charge: RM40 (11PM \u2013 1AM), RM60 (1AM onwards)\nAddress: 12 Jalan Pinang, Kuala Lumpur City Centre, 50450 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Wed, Fri \u2013 Sun 5PM \u2013 5AM | Thu 5PM \u2013 1AM\nBangsar Baru\nLined with luxury condos and villas along its outskirts, Bangsar Baru is regarded as a more affluent area of the city. The surrounding high-end residences mean you\u2019ll be able to access a more exclusive club experience.\n4. Jiro \u2013 exclusivity and underground house music\nFor a start, Jiro is actually pronounced as \u201cjai-ro\u201d, so that you won\u2019t mistakenly refer to it as \u201cjee-ro\u201d as others including myself have initially done. Equipped with a top-of-the-line surround sound system to bring out the calming ambient sounds of deep house, this club caters to discerning underground music lovers.\nWith its prime location over Bangsar Baru and Jalan Telawi, Jiro hosts frequent VIP room bookings, where bottle service and a private DJ will make you feel extra special over the already-exclusive club.\nCover charge: RM40\nAddress: 61 Jalan Telawi 3, Bangsar Baru, 59100 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Tue \u2013 Sat 6PM \u2013 3AM\nIt\u2019s no secret Malaysia has plenty of heritage, so BarAtas combines its modern hip-hop and Top 40 music concept with \u201860s Malaysian artifacts like Chinese lanterns, a rusty old bicycle, framed 1960s beer ads and a mural of a girl flying a Kelantanese wau kite decorated throughout its interior.\nTo really get into the traditional mood, you can chill by the bar or out on the cosy balcony with a locally-influenced Cendol Atas (RM28) cocktail. Ladies get free cocktails for the whole night twice a week, so this is definitely one to head to if on a budget.\nCover charge: None\nAddress: 3-1 Jalan Telawi 2, Bangsar Baru, 59100 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Tue \u2013 Sun 5PM \u2013 3AM\nLike Artebar, SIX is similar in that you can get your hunger fixed in its lower floor and head upstairs for a raving good time with its plentiful R&B parties. Ladies get to party for cheap twice a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays, with specially-made drinks from 10:30PM onwards.\nCocktails are where it\u2019s at though, and a visit to SIX without having its signature 6 Wrongs Do Make A Right (RM32) is never complete. If you\u2019re looking for something less common but still unique, the Sweet 6teen (RM36) is a good choice.\nCover charge: None\nAddress: 33 Jalan Telawi 3, Bangsar Baru, 59100 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Tue \u2013 Sun 7PM \u2013 3AM\nHilton Hotel\nJust about everyone is familiar with the Hilton chain of international hotels, so it\u2019s of no surprise that its entertainment choices are at least of decent quality. With plenty to do within the hotel itself, there\u2019s no real need to leave the premises, even for having fun.\n7. Zeta Bar \u2013 jam along to live music from resident bands\nWhile most clubs have dedicated DJs spin and mix recorded music, Zeta Bar is the only major club in KL solely dedicated to live bands performing, namely international ones. If you prefer your beats to be raw, this is definitely your jive. Bands performing at Zeta generally hold residencies for 3 months, before they\u2019re replaced to keep things fresh.\nBeing within the established Hilton hotel, celebrities sometimes drop by to visit, with Jennifer Lopez once even crashing the club with an impromptu set before her world tour concert the next day! As you dance away on the spacious floor in front of the stage, it\u2019s a good idea to pick up a Dirty Martini (RM54) with olives to quench your thirst.\nCover charge: None\nAddress: 3 Jalan Stesen Sentral, Hilton Kuala Lumpur, 50470 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Mon \u2013 Tue 8PM \u2013 2AM | Wed \u2013 Sat 8PM \u2013 3AM\nJalan Raja Chulan\nA short walk from Bukit Bintang, the trendy entertainment district of KL, the foot reflexology spas and roadside hawkers at Jalan Raja Chulan let you recharge from the tiring business of clubbing, so you can get back on your feet in no time.\n8. Prime Touch Luxury \u2013 themed clubbing nights\nAs the name suggests, Prime Touch Luxury aims to provide an upscale experience to its patrons, featuring a floor-to-ceiling glass wall to give its facade a look of sophistication. The club is frequently packed full of people wanting to be part of the action within, especially on weekends with EDM or Tupac tribute nights.\nCover charge: Ladies RM60 | Males RM70\nAddress: Wisma Goldhill Level 31, Jalan Raja Chulan, 50200 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Tue \u2013 Sun 10PM \u2013 5AM\nFuze is renowned for its massive floor capacity, large enough to accommodate 1,500 people, ideal for when international DJs such as Alexis Grace drop by and the party jumping into full swing. The dual floor design with a balcony overlooking the main stage ensures a great view of the proceedings from anywhere within, ideal for those with FOMO.\nTo draw in discerning clubbers seeking more intimacy, Fuze opened its doors to its secondary concept Flux in October 2017, with a respectable 200-pax capacity. The red interior all around brings a seductive twist to its urban R&B and hip-hop theme, just right for channeling your inner Ne-Yo.\nCover charge:\nThursday \u2013 Ladies free all night | Males free entry before 12AM, RM38 after 12AM\nFriday \u2013 Ladies free entry before 12AM, RM38 after 12AM | Males RM48 all night\nSaturday \u2013 Ladies RM38 all night | Males RM48 all night\nAddress: 1 Jalan Kia Peng, 50450 Kuala Lumpur\nOpening hours: Thu \u2013 Sat 10PM \u2013 3AM | Sun 9AM \u2013 3AM\nGet the party started in KL\nKuala Lumpur has a lot to offer when it comes to clubbing, as long as you know where to go. With lower entry fees in comparison to that of Singapore\u2019s clubs, the experience is a lot more accessible to those on a budget weekend getaway. Armed with this list, you\u2019ll easily be able to find a KL nightspot to suit your preferences!\nUpcoming Events\nTrending\n1 day ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\n3 days ago\n4 days ago\n5 days ago\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2020 TheSmartLocal.com\n56\nSHARES\n"

            "Entertainment | March 19, 2020\nImage: Zouk Club\nAfter dark, Singapore instantly transforms itself into a vibrant entertainment hub.

At that height, you can expect a panoramic, breathtaking view that will serve as a splendid backdrop for your drinking and socializing night.\nPartying with the finest cocktails and beautiful crowd: Their creative cocktails and premium spirits will give you a beautiful start.

            "08.07.19\nIn the past, it was only a handful of clubs that dictated the nightlife scene in Singapore. They set the direction for music tastes, decided which nights to draw crowds, and in turn, determined when and where people had a good time. This has changed dramatically in the last few years, thanks to a growing number of independent party promoters who are hosting regular events that offer much more diverse sounds and entertainment in unlikely spaces. On any given weekend, we can count on their specialty nights to deliver feel-good ambient, hip-hop and house music in warehouses, hotels and secret locations for a new generation of seasoned club kids. We asked some of Singapore's best party organisers why they do what they do and what you can expect from their next event.\nOrio Leshem, Fat Fish Familia\nOriginally from Israel, Orio Leshem used to throw parties in Jerusalem in the early 2000s. The founder of Fat Fish Familia is known for his genre agnostic sets that can range from disco to sixties rock 'n' roll, to the latest house releases, all packed back-to-back in a set. It's this anything-goes format that has seen him and guests such as Louie Vega, Soulclap, and Wolf and Lamb pack out their various theme nights that includes The Lost Boys, Purpleism and the Fat Fish flagship\u00a0event Strawberry Space.\nState of the Singapore party scene: It's in a great place, compared to four years ago. There are a lot of interesting collectives, talented DJs and producers, and proper clubs that deliver fantastic vibes and great international bookings, as well as many badass promoters that deliver out-of-club experiences.\nContribution to Singapore's entertainment scene: We book different big acts from around the world who represent house, disco, funk and soul, and give local and Singapore-based DJs, artists and designers a platform alongside them.\nAudience: Our audience ranges from 21 to 60 years old who want to share the love for life, music, and our planet.\nUpcoming event: Our upcoming event is on 13 July, over the French Independence Day weekend. Guests can expect incredible sounds and out-of-this-world decorations (literally)! With music from over 15 local and international DJs, you can expect great vibes at our very first Strawberry Space Open Air . Guests will also have the chance to win amazing prizes. We will be donating proceeds from each ticket purchased to our non-profit partner, Paddle for the Planet to raise awareness for marine conservation and clearing plastic from our oceans.\nVibe of party in three words: Nothing but love!\nZig Zach, Blackout Agency\nWhat started off as a club night with his buddy Danny Fry at Kilo Lounge in 2014 has gone on to evolve into Blackout, a full-fledged booking agency, music consultancy and events company. Over the last five years, it has been responsible for the party series Escape 56, Secret Villa Parties Asia, and the afternoon market Sunday Social that takes place in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia.\nState of the Singapore party scene: Singapore has totally\u00a0raised its game! On any given\u00a0weekend, we are spoilt for choice. From warehouse parties, pool parties, rooftop parties, clubs, secret location parties and daytime parties, sometimes there can be abit too much going on for the amount of people we have here. However, it adds flavour and variety to this tiny island.\nIf you weren't a promoter, what would you be doing: I'd be beating people up for money. I was a professional muaythai fighter. I racked up 35 professional fights internationally before I decided to stop.\nUpcoming event: The confirmed dates so far are 13 September and 9 November under the Escape 56 banner in Singapore. Our party in September has been picked up by Singapore Tourism Board and will be part of the F1 GPSS events. I'm glad that we're getting noticed for all the right reasons. We haven't announced our guest DJ or location, so we have to keep it a secret for now.\nVibe of party in three words: Unique. Quality. Experience.\nCollective Minds is a collaborative events and talent agency that's located in nine cities across Asia. It has been responsible for bringing some of the most exciting and eclectic names in jazz, soul and electronica to our shores such as Kasmasi Washington, Daniel Casear, Lauryn Hill, and Mac Ayers to name a few. Co-founded by Zaran Vachha and Alfred Castillo who met while working on Singapore Jazz Festival, Zaran cut his teeth in London for 10 years and Hong Kong for five, before co-founding Collective Minds in 2017. Realising that promoters in the region were working against each other and not with each other while agents were taking advantage of this to drive up prices, their mission is to collaborate, not cannibalise, to champion niche markets and support independent promoters, and change perceptions of the Asian music scene in the process.\nState of Singapore's party scene: The scene is popping. It seems Singapore is fighting hard to get rid of its 'boring' city label. People are doing some amazing stuff here. Each club is different from the next.\nBecoming a promoter: I honestly tried to shy away from it. I have a degree in neuroscience and statistics and a masters in business, but it kept on drawing me back in.\u00a0It has to be up there with the most stressful careers on the planet. If you don't believe me, come and fight me. I have always wanted to own a deli with wines, meats, and cheese though. Perhaps, I'll do that when I retire.\nAudience: Whether you are a weekday lawyer who's a weekend raver, hip-hop kid stuck in the golden era, a red wine-drinking aunty or someone who's Spotify playlist is from the future, we want to ensure everyone has access to the music they want.\nSingapore-based party collective, Ice Cream Sundays have only been around since August 2016, but they have already thrown over 20 parties, from intimate rooftop gatherings in residential spaces to large-scale public space takeovers. The collective got its start when high school classmates Jake Camacho and Daniel O'Connor reunited in Singapore after stints abroad, with a desire to introduce fresh experiences to the local scene. They kicked off their first event on a rooftop in Geylang. It quickly expanded when photographer Meltem Acik stepped in to take photographs for their first event, going on to become an integral member of the organising team. Soon after, Yasmine Faingnaert became involved as a volunteer, where she quickly made her contribution felt and took on a core role in the group. More recently, the collective has added resident DJs Nick Bong and Muto Masashi into the mix. A diverse group spanning six nationalities and counting, they believe in bringing people together to build friendships, collaborate, champion social causes, and celebrate good music.\nState of Singapore's party scene: There's no shortage of top-class international acts stopping through, driven by the likes of The Council, Kilo, and promoters like Collective Minds, Blackout Agency and Fat Fish, to name a few. It's also especially heartwarming to see more Singapore-focused collectives, like Darker Than Wax, go from strength to strength. Beyond the world of promoters, the relatively recent spate of record stores such as White Label, The Analog Vault, and Choice Cuts, as well as content platforms like Singapore Community Radio, are tirelessly pushing the diverse spectrum of sounds day in, day out, and providing opportunities for lesser known local and regional talent to play.\nBecoming a promoter: All of us at Ice Cream Sundays have day jobs that keep us busy when we aren't in party mode. Promoting the events is purely a passion project, albeit one that has become a truly significant part of each of our lives.\nContribution to Singapore's entertainment scene: We provide a refreshing alternative to the club circuit, because we try to pop up in unique outdoor venues around the island. Daytime parties are relatively out of the ordinary, especially when they fall on a Sunday. There weren't too many options for a good Sunday session when we kicked off a few years ago. Though we are not necessarily bound to Sundays anymore, the day-to-night concept will always be at the heart of what we do. Recently, we've started to collaborate with local creatives to integrate visual art, as well as decorative installations to really complete the experience, while still remaining true to the DIY spirit that permeates through all of our parties.\nAudience: While the bulk of our crowd are in their mid 20s to mid 30s, the demographic has broadened to include all ages with a good blend of locals and internationals that has naturally developed over time thanks to the collaborative work we've done with a range of local collectives, DJs, and creatives.\nUpcoming event: Our next event will be a collaboration with one of our favorite local collectives on National Day. It hasn't been announced yet, so we can't provide too many details, but mark your calendars for August 9th! The party will be held at a rooftop venue with a great view of the planes and fireworks.\nVibe of party in three words: Funky. Community. No-frills.\n.WAV(Y) was started by Prav and XG based on their mutual love of hip-hop and streetwear culture that they grew up with. The first .WAV(Y) party series was at a small bar along Haji Lane with a crowd of only five people on their first night, but it has grown exponentially over time. Championing unrelenting high-energy and uncompromising new school hip-hop, WAV(Y) has done over 40 standalone club nights in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, partnering up with global brands like GUESS and G-Shock.\nState of the Singapore's party scene: It's a beautiful time for the Singapore scene at the moment. Everyone is pushing the envelope in their own respective artforms and it's so great to see our peers excelling in what they do.\nContribution to Singapore's entertainment scene: We're bringing something refreshing to the nightlife and entertainment scene here. We're building a community and platform for like-minded people to gather. The vibes and energy on the night are always really organic.\nAudience: Our audience is a mix of people who are into different cultures and styles. The beauty of it is seeing people who dress differently and who are into different genres of music all vibing along together on the night.\nVibe of party in three words: Energetic, good, wavy.\nEileen Chan aka Cats on Crack, The Council\nCo-founded by Clement Chin and Eileen Chan aka DJ Cats On Crack, the duo kicked off their first event in December 2015 and had so much fun that they decided to start The Council in January 2016, so they could continue to organise parties at unexpected locations. In May 2016, they opened their first club and homeground, Headquarters. Their second alternative music venue TUFF CLUB launched in April 2018.\nState of Singapore's party scene: It's at a very exciting point right now, and there's a lot of room for exploration and experimentation. The audience has grown with an open mind and open ears too.\nContribution to Singapore's entertainment scene: Singapore has always had a thriving entertainment scene, but we've brought things back to basics. It's important to show the next generation of music lovers, punters and ravers that you don't need the frills to enjoy a good night out. Having our own venues has given us the flexibility to book acts, champion the sounds that we truly believe in, and the opportunities to take risks and experiment.\nAudience: When we first started, there were a lot more expats and foreigners attending our events, whether it was at the club, our warehouse, open-air or pop-up events. It brings me a lot of joy to see that there are a lot more locals coming out to our events with an open mind to discover the emerging sounds of the underground.\nUpcoming event: We're breaking conventions with the start of our new ambient series 'Soft Landing', where we hope to explore a different side of electronic music with our close-knit community of music lovers. We're ditching the dancefloor for a more relaxed and comfortable environment. With the right setting, we hope to open people's mind for a journey into curious spacious sounds.\nVibe of party in three words: Cathartic, spontaneous, energetic.\nBuro 24/7 Selection\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nThe Best Karaoke Bars In Tokyo\nKaraoke Kan outside | \u00a9 Dick Thomas Johnson/Flickr\nKaraoke is a mashup of the Japanese words for \u2018empty\u2019 and \u2018orchestra\u2019 \u2013 kara oukesutora. A musical track with no words has always been useful for professional singers who can\u2019t always have access to their full cast of performers. And historically it was a Japanese tradition to entertain guests with music. Combine that with the nation\u2019s penchant for innovation and entertainment, and karaoke was born. Here are the top places to get in touch with your inner Japanese and sing your heart out in Tokyo.\nara\nMusic Venue\nThrowing the social aspect of karaoke out the window, 1Kara takes a different approach and offers karaoke booths for one. For first-timers, it\u2019s the perfect place to practice before your next party. And for seasoned singers, nothing is more therapeutic than belting out your favorite tunes without worrying if the neighbors are listening. A basic booth will set you back around 800 yen an hour on weekdays and 900 yen on weekends, with luxury upgrades available. Headphones are used instead of speakers, so if you forget yours, rentals are available for a 300 yen fee.\nPermanently closed\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nKaraoke Kan outside | \u00a9 Dick Thomas Johnson/Flickr\nKaraoke Kan is a popular karaoke chain with branches in all of Tokyo\u2019s main entertainment districts, and three along Meiji-dori alone. Offering all-you-can-drink deals until dawn, it\u2019s easy to see how it became popular with everyone from university students and housewives to salarymen and expats. Karaoke Kan has a wide selection of rooms, from basic and VIP to large party rooms \u2013 the ones in Kabukicho can accommodate over 60 people. Prices change from day to night, weekday to weekend, and from branch to branch, ranging from around 80 yen every 30 minutes during the day to 600 yen on the weekend at night. One drink order minimum required.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nAmour offers a quiet, private alternative to the usual boisterous karaoke scene. The establishment only has four small rooms, which are perfect for low-key karaoke parties. Lady Gaga was a customer here in 2012.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nLocated in Kabukicho, this snack bar will have you singing alongside live electric guitar and whatever other instruments the owners happen to have lying around. Studio Himawari offers their karaoke sessions for 3,000 yen including snacks and tea, while alcoholic drinks begin at a reasonable 500 yen. The studio is open until 7AM, making it popular with other bar staff who work in the neighborhood. Closed on Wednesdays.\nMore Info\nUta Hiroba in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, Tokyo | \u00a9 Dick Thomas Johnson/Flickr\nUta Hiroba is all about the music. Although the d\u00e9cor can be a bit gaudy at times, that doesn\u2019t distract singers from the wide selection of music available here \u2013 Disney tracks included. Uta Hiroba\u2019s starting prices are not that different from competing branches like Karaoke Kan at 240 yen per hour on daytime weekdays, and 700 yen at night on weekends. But they remain a favorite because the drinks bar is included in the price, which often more than makes up for the difference.\nMore Info\nEntrance to the Pasela Resorts in Roppongi | \u00a9 Syced/WikiCommons\nKnown to collaborate with popular manga and anime franchises, Pasela Resorts karaoke and restaurant is a haven for gamers and otaku. But their impressive selection of foreign songs is contributing to the karaoke bar\u2019s popularity among expats, too. The party rooms are perfect for birthdays and other private occasions, thanks to Pasela\u2019s extensive menu, which includes things like honey toast \u2013 a large, toasted sweet bread square dressed like a cake.\nMore Info\n"

There are regular karaoke \u2018boxes\u2019 for you and your friends, one-person hitokara booths for shy crooners, and establishments specialising in anime songs, J-pop or other under-the-radar genres.\nOne of the more curious styles is live-band karaoke, in which your singing is accompanied by real musicians who are not afraid to switch up the tempo or improvise in other creative ways.

Head to one of these six Tokyo spots to find out.\nTokyo's best live-band karaoke venues\nThings to do\nGinza\nBan x Kara\u2019s second Tokyo location not only lets you show off your vocal range backed by a professional band \u2013 you and your friends are welcome to also take over on the guitar, drums or some other instrument while you do your best pop idol impression. Able to accommodate groups of up to 80 people, Zone-GZ is one of the most spacious live karaoke establishments in the capital, so those of you planning a company bonding night, or who just happen to be incredibly popular, might want to give this one a go. Couples\u2019 rooms and VIP booths cater to those on the hunt for something more intimate, and additional entertainment options range from darts to hookah smoking rooms.\nShinjuku\nYou\u2019ll feel like a real star when you step onto the gorgeously decorated stage at, uh, Stage, Kabukicho\u2019s finest live karaoke bar. The house band\u2019s repertoire includes an unbelievable 15,000 songs, from which you can choose your favourites using a simple electronic controller. Booking the entire place is an option for large groups, while smaller parties and solo singers can usually walk right in and won\u2019t need to wait long for their moment in the spotlight.\nRoppongi\nA bar and restaurant that also happens to do live karaoke, Ban x Kara Zone-R is the ideal destination for those looking for a more laidback venue at which to perform. The resident musicians are very versatile and know a ridiculous amount of tunes. And as is to be expected of a place that is primarily a restaurant, the food and drinks here are better than at many other karaoke joints \u2013 fresh ingredients are sourced daily from trusted farmers, and the wine cellar is packed with fine bottles from all over the world.\nKarat in Ginza is one of the few live karaoke establishments with a proper concert-hall setting, including seats for an audience of up to 50. Karat\u2019s band promises to at least try to fulfil all requests, however obscure, so those looking to sing something other than Adele or Arashi may want to put Karat close to the top of their list. Cheered on (or booed, depending on your efforts) by a proper crowd, you can get a taste of what professional singers have to deal with every time they step into the spotlight.\nShinjuku\nLeave it to a ramen shop to do live karaoke the right way: Live Lounge Taketora is run by the folks behind Shinjuku noodle joint Mensho Taketora and goes all out to really make you feel like a star. In addition to a full band, they have lasers, smoke machines and your face will be projected onto a huge flat-screen TV, on which onlookers can take in the full majesty of your performance. The all-you-can-drink menu \u2013 which helps the nerves if not always the quality of the performances \u2013 boasts significantly more variety than most bottomless bars and there\u2019s pizza available to soak up the excess. Large groups are accommodated, but you\u2019ll need to book ahead if you\u2019re planning a concert for a group of your friends.\nNishi-Shinjuku\nA pioneer in the live karaoke business, Nishi-Shinjuku\u2019s 21st Century has let guests perform with the resident band since 1976, and with that amount of experience in the bag, the musicians here aren\u2019t just content with playing by the book. You can expect them to react to your vocals and switch up the tempo as needed. Their repertoire includes over 2,600 songs, from classics to the latest chart hits. And when you need a breather, just sit down and enjoy the antics of 21st Century\u2019s own performers, whose efforts are sure to get you fired up for your next go. The regular cover charge is \u00a55,000 but first-timers get in for \u00a53,000.\nPhoto: yakiimo.sonotega.com\nWe round up the city's best gourmet festivals \u2013 from chanko nabe and sweet potatoes to chocolate, wine and lots and lots of beer\nLove the mag?\nOur newsletter hand-delivers its best bits to your inbox.

            "6 of the worl...\n6 of the world\u2019s best bars are now in Singapore, with 3 among the top 20\nBy\nOctober 4, 2019\nSix of Singapore\u2019s bars made it to the list, including newcomer Atlas as well as veterans like Manhatten and Jigger & Pony.\nThe Asian nightlife is world-renowned, and the latest list of the world\u2019s top bars has put the limelight on six of Singapore\u2019s best watering holes.\nThe World\u2019s 50 Best Bars list, released in London on Wednesday (Oct 3), is based on votes from over 500 industry experts across the globe, taking into account the most innovative and exciting developments in bars and bartending.\nThe world\u2019s three best bars are: Dante, New York, Connaught Bar, London, and Floreria Atlantico, Buenos Aires.\nRegionally, there are a total of 13 bars that made it to the list, seven excluding Singapore. Two each from Hong Kong, Japan and China, and one from Taiwan.\nHere are the Singaporean bars that made it onto the list:\n1. Atlas \u2013 8th place\nSingapore\u2019s Atlas bar \u2013 which is only two years old \u2013 overtook the likes of Hong Kong\u2019s The Old Man for eigth place.\nAtlas is located at the ground floor of Parkview Square, one of Singapore\u2019s most iconic buildings. The architecture of the building was inspired by the Art Deco skyscrapers of Europe and New York.\nThe highlight at Atlas is a gin tower which houses a massive collection of over 1,300 different spirits.\ncaption\nsource\nAtlas\n2. Manhattan \u2013 11th place\nLocated at the Regent Hotel, the bar is best known for its classics-based drinks. It prides itself on its old world glamour, with velvet armchairs and grand mahogany tables.\n3. Native \u2013 12th place\nSituated on Amoy Street, this Asia-centric bar is only three years old, and sources everything strictly from the region.\u00a0Even the wares, scents and music are sourced from local and regional craftsmen.\nIt serves cocktails with South-east Asian ingredients like jasmine blossoms, aged sugarcane, turmeric leaves, Thai rum, and also ants. Yes, ants.\nNative also picked up the Ketel One Sustainability Award earlier in the year.\ncaption\nThe drinks here are strictly new creations only, so don\u2019t expect to find the classics.\nsource\nNative\n4. Jigger & Pony \u2013 29th place\nThis bar boasts\u00a0classic and vintage cocktails served on a dark wood counter, and its signature warm and professional hospitality.\nIts new venue at Amara Hotel in Tanjong Pagar has a menu which is actually a magazine, and features 27 cocktails based on the classics, but with fresh twists.\ncaption\nsource\nWorld\u2019s 50 Best Bars\n5. Operation Dagger \u2013 30th place\nThis cool and mysterious subterranean bar is located at Ann Siang Hill and looks like an apothecary. Step inside the nondescript entrance and you\u2019ll be greeted with a light cloud, formed by several hundred lightbulbs.\nCustomers can also ask for their drinks \u201comakase\u201d, a\u00a0flight of cocktails picked by the bartender.\ncaption\nsource\n6. The Old Man, Singapore \u2013 38th place\nSister venue to the original in Hong Kong \u2013 which took 9th place \u2013 this bar boasts highly creative drinks which follow the original Hong Kong recipes to a tee.\nLocated in Chinatown on the popular Keong Saik Road, there is no sign to indicate its location, merely a pineapple lamp above the door, so keep your eyes peeled.\ncaption\nThis venue is significantly larger than the one in Hong Kong\nsource\nRead Also:\nPopular Articles\n"

            "icon-chevron-right\nGet the party started at these unusual suspects\nBy the Time Out KL team\nAdvertising\nPudu\nNestled in an 80-year-old building on a tucked-away street, Barlai is a picture-perfect place \u2013 all exposed bricks, restored road signs and wooden tables. The choice is yours: You can book the bar to fit 40 to 50 of your family and friends, or make a reservation for a smaller, tight-knit group of four or five so you can have the mezzanine all to yourselves. If you\u2019re going to party the night away, book a room at Sekeping Sin Chew Kee. It\u2019s conveniently upstairs.\nBukit Bintang\nIf it\u2019s going to be a family affair, rock out at Replay (RM29 per pax) \u2013 this would be a good choice if you\u2019re also into Japanese food and Korean songs. The birthday promotion is valid for parties of five and above (with one free admission). They can also accommodate parties of 30 to 300 people; just drop them a line to work it out. For a more luxurious birthday karaoke experience, Neway CEO (RM60++ per pax) has all the fixings: elegant, non-tacky interiors, large rooms to accommodate up to 50 guests, and quality sound and services. That\u2019s only half the fun \u2013 make a reservation for five and above and receive one free admission, a birthday cake and sparkling cooler. On a budget? Try Loud Speaker (RM208 after 7pm for four pax, 12 bottles of beer, and free refill for tidbits and selected drinks), one of the cheapest karaokes in the city.\nKL City Centre\nYes, you can have it all \u2013 that is, if by \u2018all\u2019 you\u2019re referring to bowling lanes, darts, karaoke and pool, as well as a dance club, a full-service bar, a private champagne and cocktail lounge, tapas, and a Western fusion kitchen.\nBukit Bintang\nHere\u2019s an idea: A blind date \u2013 literally. Dining in the Dark is a concept restaurant where you, well, dine in the dark, guided and served by the visually impaired; this is one for adventure seekers and the socially conscious. If you make a reservation for up to 50 pax \u2013 they\u2019ll sing you a birthday song while dessert is served, and maybe throw in a small thoughtful gift. In the pitch black, you won\u2019t be able to see your friends or food, but you know what people say: \u2018It\u2019s better in the dark.\u2019\nKL City Centre\nWhat\u2019s better than a party? A spa party \u2013 or a sparty, for short. Choose from the sparty packages available or customise your own. A basic sparty package comes with a 90-minute treatment that includes a body massage and a hot stone massage using au naturel products. From RM150 per pax, your sparty will also come with a chocolate fondue, cocktails or tea, and other savoury snacks.\nKL City Centre\nBefore time runs out, you and up to seven others must put your detective cap on, solve the mystery and bust out of the room \u2013 themes include a dangerous wanted magician, murder and weapons of mass destruction. Happy birthday.\nSunway\nThe basic G-Troopers Party Plus+ package includes three missions of laser tag, two hours\u2019 usage of a private function room and one free membership for the birthday person, as well as food, light refreshments and party packs. For longer hours of the function room and more laser tag missions, opt for the G-Troopers Xtreme Party package or the G-Troopers Xtreme Party package. If you want, request for the karaoke setup too \u2013 it\u2019s available for rent for an additional RM5 per person.\nKota Damansara\nBring friends, skip straight to dessert and roll the dice. With dozens of board games to choose from, you\u2019ll enjoy the face-to-face interaction, the feeling of working together towards a clear, shared goal, and a free scoop of ice cream for the birthday person.\nLove the mag?\nOur newsletter hand-delivers its best bits to your inbox.

            "Nature reserves in Penang, Sarawak, Sabah, and Selangor\nMalaysia sits at the heart of Southeast Asia\u2019s most bio-diverse territory, covering thousands of plant and animal species in a multitude of habitats, altitudes, and ecosystems. The Malaysian government has set aside parts of its territory as nature reserves: places where visitors can see nature up close without spoiling the environment.\nCheck out these nature reserves the next time you visit Malaysia\u2014many of them are surprisingly close to major Malaysian cities, and can be seen in the space of a day.\n01 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nGunung Gading National Park in Sarawak was established specifically to protect the rare, odoriferous Rafflesia flower . The flower is one of Southeast Asia\u2019s weirdest wildlife finds. The park is the perfect setting for the Rafflesia flower\u2014the landscape is carpeted in dense rainforest and cut through by mountain streams. A 'plank walk' crosses the ground above blooming Rafflesia, allowing visitors to observe the plants without disturbing them.\nThe Park is best explored through a series of trekking trails, the longest one ascending the park\u2019s namesake mountain (Gunung Gading). The Gunung Gading park can be easily reached from the city of Kuching ; only day trips are permitted within the park grounds, as camping in the park is not allowed.\n02 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nOnly two hours\u2019 drive from Kuala Lumpur , this wetland nature reserve protects about 800 acres of mangrove, estuaries, and a 25-acre brackish lake. Permanent residents include fiddler crabs, silvered langur monkeys, herons, and Brahminy kites. Migratory birds also use Kuala Selangor as a stopover.\nAround the lake, you can set up shop at one of three wildlife observation towers, and watch out for the wildlife going about their business. Visits to the park begin at the Visitor\u2019s Center, where you can pay for entrance, get refreshments, and souvenirs after your jaunt around the park.\n03 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nFor such a small park (17,180 acres), the Lambir Hills National Park in Sarawak possesses an extremely diverse ecosystem, with thousands of plant and animal species sheltering in the park premises. Over 230 different avian species can be found in Lambir Hills! Perhaps because of it\u2019s the rugged terrain\u2013the hilly sandstone covered with dipterocarp forest, and an endless series of bathing pools and waterfalls.\nVisitors can explore Lambir Hills through a variety of forest walks for all fitness levels\u2013some walks take less than 20 minutes to finish, while others require the whole day and a stout constitution. The park is conveniently located only 30 minutes by bus from Miri.\n04 of 12\nMount Kinabalu, Sabah\nTourism Malaysia\nMount Kinabalu looms over 13,000 feet over Sabah\u2013the tallest mountain in Malaysia, covering about 300 square miles of pristine forest and mountain territory. It shelters over 326 species of birds, 4,500 species of plants, and 100 different species of mammal.\nSurprisingly, the mountain is a relative doddle to climb\u2014over 40,000 people a year come to Mount Kinabalu just to climb it, with no need for special equipment or experience.\nDue to the biodiversity on its slopes, Mount Kinabalu (specifically, the park that was created to protect it) was recognized as Malaysia's first World Heritage Site in 2000. The entrance to the park is located about 56 miles from Kota Kinabalu , a two-hour journey by bus from the state capital.\nContinue to 5 of 12 below.\n05 of 12\nMalaysia Tourism\nMalaysia's smallest and youngest national park is located on the northwestern tip of Penang Island\u2014a 10 square mile parcel of land. It shelters a \u201cmeromictic\u201d lake (a kind of lake with both salty and fresh-water that do not mix), eight of Penang\u2019s most unspoiled beaches, and mangrove forests.\nStart at the Interpretation Center at the park entrance before you head out into the interior. Three trails lead into the Park\u2019s diverse collection of habitats; you can actually see the entirety of the park\u2019s contents within a single day if you begin early enough!\n06 of 12\nGrant Dixon / Getty Images\nThe 1,613-acre Semenggoh Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre is an animal shelter dedicated to the preservation of the endangered orangutan. Far from being kept in cages, the orangutans in Semenggoh are allowed to come and go as they please, enjoying the thick forest canopy as free apes and benefiting from the care of the park rangers.\nMost of the orangutans came to Semenggoh as orphans or rescues from captivity\u2014the main goal of the park is to help them re-acclimate to life in the wild.\nIn Semenggoh, you get a rare chance to see orangutans in their natural habitat, before they make it out on their own. The park is only 12 miles south of Kuching\u2014a bus leaves from Jalan Mosque to go to Semenggoh.\n07 of 12\nRichard I'Anson / Getty Images\nLike the Semenggoh nature reserve, Sepilok in East Sabah is dedicated to the care and protection of the endangered orangutan endemic to Borneo's forests. The park is set amidst the 5,529-hectare Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve near the city of Sandakan. Visitors can climb large viewing platforms to see apes being rehabilitated for future life in the wild. Your best chance of seeing Sepilok's orangutans occurs during feeding times at 10 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; visitors are discouraged from actually touching the animals.\nIn the same forest reserve, the Rainforest Discovery Centre allows visitors to see forest life from above, through a series of elevated walkways and towers that allow visitors to view the forest canopy and its residents from 100 feet in the air!\n08 of 12\nLangkawi Geopark, Kedah\nTourism Malaysia\nThe Langkawi Geopark was the first natural reserve in Southeast Asia awarded UNESCO Global Geopark status in 2007. No surprise there, as Langkawi embodies the ideals of natural beauty and ecological harmony sought by UNESCO.\nThree geologically distinct areas make up the Langkawi Geopark, all accessible through tours arranged in the city. The Kilim River\u2019s limestone formations make up the best part of the Kilim Karst Geoforest Park; the Machinchang Cambrian Geoforest Park, on the other hand, revolves around a granite mountain dating back to the Paleozoic.\nFinally, the Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest Park lies south of Langkawi, centered around Langkawi\u2019s second-largest island Pulau Dayang Bunting.\nContinue to 9 of 12 below.\n09 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nThis marine park covers about 12,185 acres of sea territory, with five islands and masses of coral reefs within its boundaries. Located only five miles from Kota Kinabalu , the Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is a favorite getaway for Kinabalu families on weekends. You can go camping on the beach on most of the islands in the park, but you\u2019ll be charged a camping permit before you set up camp.\nTunku Abdul Rahman Park\u2019s corals shelter an impressive variety of marine life\u2014this, in addition to the marine park\u2019s shallow water and weak currents, makes it a prime stop for divers. If you\u2019re lucky, you may see whale sharks hunting plankton in these waters. (Find out more about diving in Sabah .)\n10 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nThe Temenggor Lake at the center of the Royal Belum State Park was formed by a hydroelectric dam project ; despite the lake\u2019s recent vintage, the rainforest that surrounds it is one of the world\u2019s oldest, dating back some 130 million years.\nSome of the world\u2019s most endangered large mammals make their home in the forests, among them the Asiatic Elephant, Sumatran Rhinoceros, and the Malayan Tapir. It\u2019s not likely that a casual visitor will spy them on their first trip out, but there\u2019s far more to the park than rare animals.\nYou might be able to see one or more of the three species of rafflesia flower in the underbrush or go freshwater fishing in Lake Temenggor. You can also trek to the Pulau Tujuh waterfalls, visit the massive Temenggor Dam, or make contact with the local orang asli (tribal folk) who live in Kampung Chuweh.\n11 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nSet in 400 acres of Sabah jungle about 24 miles from Sandakan airport, the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary is home to about 60 floppy-nosed proboscis monkeys. It is a small community of gravely endangered primates whose habitat has been seriously eroded by human encroachment. (Forests have been cleared to make way for palm oil plantations\u2014the monkeys have nowhere else to go.)\nVisitors get a rare chance to see proboscis monkeys in a semi-wild environment within the park premises\u2014two platforms serve the monkeys during two daily feeding times. The park\u2019s trails also allow guests to explore the surrounding forest; visitors should leave early in the morning, to see the animals at their most active.\n12 of 12\nTourism Malaysia\nWhile Kubah National Park has its fair share of animals, it\u2019s the plant life that really draws your attention. This includes orchids, pitcher plants, and over 90 species of tropical palm that inhabit the 2,200 hectares that make up this nature reserve a short drive from Kuching .\nThe Matang mountain range creates the Park\u2019s dramatic backdrop, most particularly Gunung Serapi, whose summit can be easily reached over a paved pedestrian road. It takes six hours to get there and back. For a real challenge, try one of the six jungle trails that take travelers deep into the local dipterocarp forest, and to scenic stops like the Kubah Waterfall and several viewpoints looking over the mountains and the Santubong peninsula beyond.\nCamping facilities are available for travelers who want to stay overnight and make the most out of their Kubah National Park visit.\nWas this page helpful?\nEmail Address\nSign up\nThank you [email] for signing up.\nFollow us\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nWild deer at Baluran National Park | \u00a9 johan.wildlife/Flickr\nIndonesia has a fascinating and diverse culture contributed by hundreds of different ethnic groups. And while that does make the country special, let\u2019s not forget a huge and equally important portion of the archipelago\u2019s inhabitants. Read our guide on where to find Indonesia\u2019s incredible wildlife.\nTanjung Puting National Park\nTwo orangutans at Tanjung Puting National Park | \u00a9 Megan Coughlin / Flickr\nLocated in the world\u2019s lung Borneo , this area is surrounded by lush tropical jungles, making it a perfect natural habitat for various wild species, including the adorable orangutan primates, pythons, the endemic bearded pig, as well as tropical plants. The park covers 416 hectares of forest, swamps, mangrove, and beach, each with different wildlife ecosystem to observe. Tourists can also volunteer for the park\u2019s orangutan conservation efforts.\nMore Info\nWild deers at Baluran National Park | \u00a9Ron Knight/Flickr\nThis national park is often dubbed \u201cIndonesia\u2019s little Africa\u201d, and for good reason. Compared to other national parks that are dominated by lush tropical forests, this location has a dry climate that sustains different sets of plants, birds, and mammals ecosystem. The area covers vast mountainous areas and savanna, where endangered mammals like banteng, Java mouse-deer, fishing cat, Javan leopard, and the Javan lutung roam free. Also in the neighborhood are hundreds of endangered plants and endemic birds. Standing tall at its center is the extinct volcano Mount Baluran. Tourists can sign up for an organized safari tour arranged by the park to ensure a more convenient and safe adventure.\nMore Info\nRafflesia arnoldi flower | \u00a9 Ettore Balocchi / Flickr\nThis expansive national park spans over four provinces in Sumatra, covering various different landscapes including Indonesia\u2019s second highest volcano peak, Mount Kerinci. The diversity of terrain makes the national park a perfect home to a mixture of amazing creatures, including protected species of tiger, rhinoceros, and birds. Beyond the animal kingdom, more than 4,000 flora can be found within the area, including the world\u2019s largest flower Rafflesia arnoldi and also the tallest flower Titan arum.\nMore Info\nThe Ancient Komodo Dragon | \u00a9 Adhi Rachdian/Flickr\nAlthough it\u2019s named after the curious ancient species of komodo dragons , this national park is home to much more biodiversity. Here, \u201cthe last dinosaur on earth\u201d shares the land with Timor deer, turtles, and a wide variety of birds. Below sea level, the park\u2019s wildlife activity gets even more lively, with more than a thousand species of tropical fish, coral, and sponges, many of which are exclusive to the lesser Sunda area. All that wildlife is packed within three large islands and smaller islands, each with gorgeous views of beaches, jungles, and hills.\nMore Info\nRhinoceros at Way Kambas National Park | \u00a9 Willem v Strien/Flickr\nAs one of the oldest nature reserves in Indonesia, this national park has been the home to rare species that have been endangered for many years, including the Sumatran elephants and Sumatran two-horned rhino. Although widely known for its elephants, this area is also frequented by local bird watchers, who hope to spot the white-winged duck and Storm\u2019s stork among others. Tourists can take a guided tour through the elephant forest and opt for a journey through the Way Kanan river by canoe to witness the park\u2019s many habitats.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nMore Info\nIsland-hopping in Raja Ampat, Papua | \u00a9 nmedia / Shutterstock\nRaja Ampat Islands have been one of the world\u2019s most-prized diving spot , boasting at least 550 species of coral and 1,400 species of fish, including whale sharks, manta rays, pygmy seahorse, and more. But not all of the archipelago\u2019s wildlife require a diving or snorkeling gear to observe. Of the 1000 small islands that comprise the archipelago, many of them have a vibrant forest ecosystem, such as spotted cuscus, colorful wild flowers, and many species of the elusive birds-of-paradise.\nMore Info\nTangkoko National Park\nA nightjar at Tangkoko | \u00a9 Nigel Voaden/Flickr\nLocated in less-traveled eastern Indonesia, this nature reserve does not receive as much credit as it deserves. Sulawesi itself is one of Indonesia\u2019s foremost wildlife fronts, supporting the lives of countless endemic and exotic species. At 8,890 hectares, Tangkoko has more than tourists could ever hope for, including the Sulawesi\u2019s prima donna bird , the Maleo. A stroll through the jungle pretty much guarantees encounters with unique species like the world\u2019s smallest primate Tarsius and black tailless monkeys.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nThe historic Krakatoa explosion in 1883 was massive enough to eliminate human civilizations, but apparently not enough to prevent the wildlife from thriving in this deserted area. For decades, the peninsula was inhabited only by various flora and fauna, making it a valuable nature reserve in West Java. The protected park is home to numerous endangered animals and plants species, including the iconic one-horned rhinoceros, Java mouse-deer, silvery gibbon, and more.\nMore Info\n"

            "Overview\nWildlife Conservation Society, is a New York-based conservation organization with goal to conserve the world's largest wild places in 15 priority regions and home to more than 50% of the world's biodiversity.\nWCS-Indonesia Program has worked in Indonesia since initial surveys in the 1960s, and opened a formal country program in 1995 under an MoU with the Ministry of Forestry (now Ministry of Environment and Forestry). WCS has operated projects on across Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara and Maluku) ranging from population and threats assessments of endangered cockatoos to studies of hunting management issues (including tiger and sharks) and the impact of logging on wildlife.

            "Destinations\nLocations\nA grotto in C\u00fac Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng National Park | \u00a9 Khoroshunova Olga/Shutterstock\nFrom the lofty mountains of the north all the way to the white sand isles of the south, national parks dot the landscape of Vietnam. Limestone peaks fall over meandering rivers and snaking caverns twist into dense jungle canopy. This is nature at its best in Southeast Asia.\nPhong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng National Park\nPerhaps the most naturally stunning and well-preserved area in all of Vietnam, Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng is home to some of the world\u2019s largest caves. The park, which shares a border with Laos\u2019 Hin Namno Nature Reserve, covers an area of nearly 900 square kilometers and is often a stop for those riding the fantastic Ho Chi Minh Highway. Gibbons and Macaques roam the forests, yet it\u2019s the sprawling karst cave systems that have earned Phong Nha a spot on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage list. Hundred of miles of underground labyrinths run beneath limestone giants that tower toward the sky.\nPhong Nha Cave Sam Roth\nPh\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c National Park\nA gem nestled in the northwest corner of Vietnam\u2019s most popular and unfortunately most overdeveloped island , Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c is home to more than 1,000 species of plant and 200 species of animal. Increasingly rare old-growth forests run throughout the park and Dipterocarp trees climb over 100 feet in height. Hiking and camping are easily accessible from G\u00e0nh D\u1ea7u village.\nReflections in the river on Phu Quoc, Vietnam \u00a9 andreevarf/Shutterstock\nN\u00fai Ch\u00faa National Park\nN\u00fai Ch\u00faa is set on the eastern edge of the Annamite Mountains, overlooking one of the cleanest and most well-preserved stretches of coastline on the East Sea. The region, like much of Vietnam, is best visited by motorbike and is fringed by one of the country\u2019s most fun and beautiful coastal roads. Within the confines of the arid park, bears, primates, bats and birds roam the hillsides. The shoreline is of particular importance as it\u2019s home to the nesting grounds of a number of endangered turtle species.\nSeascape at Hang Rai Beach, Nui Chua National Park, Ninh Thuan, Vietnam \u00a9 TBone Lee/Shutterstock\nC\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park\nC\u00e1t Ti\u00ean is the closest national park to Ho Chi Minh City and an oft overlooked gem. The lowland forests are the largest and most important in the country, home to gibbon, deer and wild boar. The nature trails are extensive and well maintained, most of which can be completed without a guide and on bicycle. An excellent variety of lodging, from campsites to riverside bungalows, makes the park a great place to escape from Saigon\u2019s concrete madness.\nTropical river in middle of Cat Tien national park, Vietnam \u00a9 bee-eater/Shutterstock\nC\u00e1t B\u00e0 National Park\nFloating in a sea of limestone peaks, C\u00e1t B\u00e0 serves as a focal point of iconic H\u1ea1 Long Bay. It should be a stop on any northern excursion. Much of the region resembles something out of Jurassic Park as jungles shoot skyward into the mist. A number of beautiful treks of moderate difficulty lie in the park\u2019s confines. C\u00e1t B\u00e0 is also home to the majority of the world\u2019s remaining white-headed langurs.\nHalong Bay from Cat Ba island, Vietnam \u00a9 Stephane Bidouze / Shutterstock\nBa B\u1ec3 National Park\nBa B\u1ec3 National Park is home to a number of ethnic minorities including the Tay, Dao and Hmong, and offers travelers the opportunity to experience life in traditional homestays. The park is made up of towering limestone mounts that crash down to pounding waterfalls before settling in Ba B\u1ec3 lake, the largest in Vietnam. Trekking in the region is superb and can be arranged through most homestays or guesthouses. Cavernous limestone grottos, hidden along the water\u2019s edge, should be explored by boat as well.\nBa Be Lake in Bac Kan Province, Vietnam \u00a9 Supermop/Shutterstock\nYok \u0110\u00f4n National Park\nThe largest of all of Vietnam\u2019s national parks, Yok \u0110\u00f4n also happens to be home to some of the last remaining wild elephants and leopards in the country. However, over the years poaching and illegal logging have decimated their populations, dropping the chances of seeing one to pretty much zero. Nevertheless, the park retains an off-the-beaten track feel and is seldom visited by foreign tourists. Guided day and overnight treks through the dry forests are a great way to see it all.\nLak lake in Dak lak, Vietnam \u00a9 Kate Spiridonova/Shutterstock\nC\u00fac Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng National Park\nC\u00fac Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng is one of the most accessible parks Vietnam has to offer, lying just over a 100 kilometers from Hanoi. The region can be explored on foot, motorbike or bicycle and is best traveled over two or three days. Minority villages dot the lands and can be visited on a number of guided treks. The park is also home to a vast array of flora and fauna, including some of the nation\u2019s most endangered turtles.\nC\u00fac Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng, Ninh B\u00ecnh, Vietnam \u00a9 Mike Workman/Shutterstock\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park\nIn a country experiencing rapid growth and popularity, it\u2019s no real surprise that pristine natural areas are diminishing by the day. C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park remains an outlier. Eighty kilometers out into the East Sea, an unblemished archipelago of green is reached by ferry from the Mekong or via plane from Saigon. The national park lies on the main island, C\u00f4n S\u01a1n, and encompasses some of the country\u2019s most untouched coral reefs and white sand beaches. Endangered sea turtles nest along the shorelines while the strange and friendly dugong, a cousin of the manatee, lounges in the park\u2019s clear waters.\nBai Nhat Beach, Con Dao Island, Vietnam \u00a9 Tappasan Phurisamrit/Shutterstock\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 National\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 lays hidden just west of the imperial capital of Hu\u1ebf, near the central coast of Vietnam. Dilapidated French villas, overrun by pine forests, peer out through the wilderness as mile-high peaks float in the distance. The park is home to some of the most dense and pristine ribbons of jungle in central Vietnam.\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 national park, Vietnam \u00a9 bee-eater/Shutterstock\n"

            "Wed, 10 Apr 2019\nThe decision late last year by the Parties to the CBD to recognise \u201cconserved areas\u201d is stimulating new conversations at the national level on diverse forms of nature conservation taking place outside protected areas. In March 2019, the IUCN Global Protected Areas Programme and the IUCN Hanoi office convened a national stakeholder workshop on these very topics.\nPhoto: James Hardcastle\n\u201cConserved areas\u201d are an emerging topic in nature conservation at the global level.\u00a0 The recent decision by the state parties to the CBD to recognise a new definition of conserved areas now considers those areas, other than protected areas, which are governed and managed in ways that achieve positive and sustained outcomes for the in-situ conservation of biodiversity, with associated ecosystem functions and services and where applicable, cultural, spiritual, socio-economic and other locally relevant values.\u00a0 This is a milestone concept for the nature conservation world.\u00a0 While we have conventionally and traditionally thought about protected areas being the mainstay of nature conservation, new avenues for the recognising the sustainable use of biodiversity outside protected areas are now opening up.\nThis concept builds very well on the already existing concept of \u201cGovernance diversity\u201d in protected areas.\u00a0 This articulates the idea that there may be many kinds of actors making decisions for the long term conservation of biodiversity.\u00a0 These actors can be de jure - via legally established rules such as a protected areas agency carrying out work with a government mandate, or de facto - via social practices by a local community, who conserve nature because it ensures long term livelihood benefits including food sovereignty. \u00a0Again this latter category can cover many different kinds of voluntary nature conservation practices.\nThe workshop was well attended by IUCN partners and national authorities in Viet Nam - the Department of Special-Use and Protection Forest Management under the Vietnam Administration of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Areas (MARD), and Vietnam\u2019s Park and Nature Reserve Association (VNPNA). Academics, civil society organisations, national practitioners from several national parks in Viet Nam and other international experts were also present.\u00a0 In addition to the international categories of protected areas (World Heritage, Ramsar and ASEAN sites) Viet Nam has four national categories of protected area: national parks, nature reserves including protected and \u2018special use\u2019 forests, species habitats and protected landscapes.\u00a0 While it is clear that in Viet Nam, the governance type is predominantly governance type 1 \u2013 or governance by the government, there exists a multitude of ways that local people can participate and benefit from the ecosystem services of protected and conserved areas.\u00a0 Two local partners presented examples. The Centre of Research and Development in Upland Areas (CERDA) offered an overview of their work in the Thai Nguyen and Thanh Hoa provinces, where they support local people and authorities to promote equitable access, use of natural resources and good governance to enable social, economic and environmental sustainability.\u00a0 Pan Nature, another not for profit organisation, presented their work with ICCAs \u2013 indigenous peoples and community conserved areas in the Ha Giang province.\nIn the afternoon, time was set aside to discuss the possibility of identifying conserved areas in Viet Nam with all of the participants using the new CBD definition. It was a lively exchange with plenty of food for thought for Viet Nam\u2019s reporting for Aichi target 11. Possible conserved areas could include sacred forests and streams, marine areas which allow for the sustainable collection of clams, crabs and other resources, sustainable fisheries, mangrove forests and many more suggestions by the group including religious temples and orchid gardens.\u00a0 The meeting closed with the recommendations by national experts for the continued strengthening of the governance of protected and conserved areas in Viet Nam, which will be made available by the project partners to the CBD focal point in Viet Nam.\nThe workshop is part of the project \u201cProtected Areas Solutions\u201d which is funded by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB).\u00a0 This project has an overall aim of promoting Aichi Target 11 \u2013 the effective and equitable management of both protected and conserved areas, and part of the project focus is to examine the theme of governance diversity in Vietnam.\nArticle by Jenny Kelleher\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nYour Guide to Wildlife Watching in Cambodia\nLeopard cats are a rare sight in the wild but can be seen at various conservation centres \u00a9  Wildlife Alliance\nCambodia, an animal enthusiast\u2019s dream, is home to an abundance of rare and exotic birds, mammals, and marine life. Thanks to conservation efforts by a number of organizations, the wonders of Cambodia\u2019s wildlife is a world waiting to be discovered.\nFrom tigers and cat leopards to river dolphins, sun bears, and elephants, Cambodia is home to a diverse range of wildlife.\nWhile decades of illegal logging, hunting, and animal trafficking have taken their toll on many animal populations, leading to several being placed on the endangered list, huge conservation efforts are being carried out by various organizations to ensure they do not fall into extinction.\nThe result is a range of eco-tourism projects, offering visitors a unique insight into the work being carried out, as well as the opportunity to spot some wildlife along the way.\nPhnom Tamao Rescue Centre\nWildlife rescue NGO Wildlife Alliance (WA) works within Cambodia to prevent the illegal trade and trafficking of animals, as well as abuse. It also works within communities to educate on the importance of preserving, not poaching, rare animals. Its ultimate aim is to rehabilitate and return wildlife to its natural habitat, and Phnom Tamao Rescue Centre forms part of that. Sitting about 30 kilometers outside of Phnom Penh, the centre is home to a range of animals, including elephants, tigers, deer, leopards, gibbons, and otters. Avid animal fans will love WA\u2019s day tour, which gives visitors the chance to get up close and personal with the animals. This includes feeding elephants, entering the tiger\u2019s den, visiting the hand-reared baby animals, and having macaques swinging around you when you enter their enclosure.\nAddress and Phone Number:\nWildlife Release Koh Kong\nAnother of WA\u2019s pioneering projects that will appeal to wildlife enthusiasts is a visit to its wildlife release station in the heart of the Cardamom Mountains. After being rehabilitated at Phnom Tamao Rescue Centre, animals that are fit to be re-released into the wild are transported to the remote location where they are kept prior to their new lives. A range of animals, including sun bears, gibbons, monkeys, and an array of birds can be seen up close, with rangers on hand to explain their story. Treks through the surrounding jungle also take in rare flora and fauna, thick jungle, waterfalls, and swimming holes. Accommodation is basic in a bamboo hut.\nSam Veasna Centre\nIf birds are more your thing, then the Sam Veasna Centre in Siem Reap is a must. The NGO, which has been in operation since 2006, aims to protect and preserve the rare birdlife that call the spot home. From Bengal floricans and giant and white-shouldered ibis to three-critically endangered species of vulture, experienced, English-speaking guides are on hand to steer guests around the sanctuary. Various tours are held, starting from half a day. The center also prides itself on its dedication to providing employment to locals through its work.\nAddress and Phone Number:\nVultures feeding at Beng Toal Vulture Restaurant s part of one of Sam Veasna Centre's tours \u00a9  Martin Hale.\nElephant Valley Project\nThere\u2019s something truly magical about watching elephants roam around in their natural habitat, and it\u2019s an experience that\u2019s on offer at Elephant Valley Project (EVP). Offering respite to overworked and abused elephants, EVP offers them reprieve in the form of a return to their natural habitat. Based in a remote jungle in Mondulkiri, visitors can sign up for a series of trips, ranging from a full-day visit with the elephants through to five days, and a series of longer volunteering opportunities. During the visit, guests hike through the jungle, shadow the elephants as they lazily stomp through the forest, and learn about the indigenous tribes that inhabit the area and the conservation efforts going on.\nAddress and Phone Number:\nAngkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity\nAs Cambodia\u2019s first conservation and endangered wildlife rescue and breeding center in Cambodia, Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity offers daily tours of its site in Siem Reap. From pleated gibbons, silvered langurs, and slow Loris to palm civets and pangolins, there is a range of wildlife living in this sprawling sanctuary, with guides on hand to explain in depth the history behind each species, as well as the work carried out at the center to conserve these rare species.\nIrrawaddy Dolphins\nFound in coastal areas of South and Southeast Asia, the Mekong River Irrawaddy dolphin can also be spotted swimming in the Mekong River at Kratie province. Inhabiting a 118-mile stretch of the river between Cambodia and Laos, the dolphins are close to extinction, with an estimated 78 to 91 remaining. There are various tour operators that run tours to the rural province to spot these beauties.\nIrrawaddy dolphins \u00a9 FiA / WWF-Cambodia\n"

The castle\u2019s main tower burned down in the 18th century, but the castle\u2019s Ninomaru Palace is worth the visit alone to see the might and power of the former shoguns. The Palace features exquisite interiors such as paintings on ornate sliding paper doors, gold leaf covered rooms, elegant ceilings and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, ninja proof chirping nightingale floors .\nAdd to Plan\nWalk through the red torii gates at Fushimi Inari-Taisha Shrine | \u00a9 Dr_Flash / Shutterstock\nFushimi Inari Taisha is Kyoto\u2019s most important shrine and is dedicated to the Shinto god of rice.

The balcony was built without the use of nails, highlighting the amazing craftsmanship and skill of traditional Japanese carpentry techniques.\nTo-ji Temple\nTo-ji Temple is a large ancient Buddhist temple complex boasting a history of over 1,200 years. Originally established as one of the guardian temples of Kyoto, it is famous for its five-story pagoda, which is the highest in Japan at 57 meters in height.\nEnryaku-ji Temple\nEnryaku-ji Temple is a monastery located on Mount Hiei which overlooks Kyoto.

            "The word \u201cbest\u201d is subjective, but when we are looking at noteworthy new cafes in Singapore, the entire package is considered \u2013 from coffee, interior, consistency to service. (Food is not key primary in this list as cafes should be coffee-focused.)\nIt is fair enough to say that new caf\u00e9 openings have slowed down this year, and many are foreign brands setting up an overseas post in Singapore.\n% Arabica Singapore\nOpening Hours: 8am \u2013 8pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nFamous Kyoto Cafe At Arab Street\n%Arabica which opened at 56 Arab Street, is still going on strong with constant crowd with both locals and tourists heading over.\nThe Arab Street branch is a small 20-seater, designed in minimalist white similar to many of the other stores world-wide. So if you are looking for comfort, perhaps this is not the place.\nCaffe Latte is priced here at $7 for short, $8 for tall, while the iced version is priced at $8. On the pricy set.\nIf you prefer something sweeter, also available is the Spanish Latte ($7.80. $9.00) which is included with condensed milk.\nI enjoyed the Iced Caffe Latte, it was as pleasurable as how I remembered it to be \u2013 the smooth milky feeling, aromatic coffee, and balanced robustness.\n% Arabica Singapore should be opening up more branches, locations set to be at Holland Village and 313@somerset. %Arabica Singapore (Arab Street)\nStarter Lab Bakery\nTel: +65 9839 0408\nFamous Bakery From Bali Opens In Singapore\nFrom hipster area of Canggu in Bali to Havelock Road, Starter Lab Bakery has opened its 2nd outpost (in the world) right here in Singapore.\nBaker-consultant Emerson Manibo has worked at New York\u2019s Per Se, trained at famed Tartine and Della Fattoria bakeries in California.\nThe bakery caf\u00e9 essentially offers a wholesome menu of posh toast (so much so they have been reviewed to serve the \u201cGucci Of Bread\u201d), sandwiches and build your own bread boards.\nAll the loaves and pastries served (other than the scones) contain sourdough/starter, and loaves are fermented over 36 hours before being baked.\nIf you are lost at what to order, some recommendations include House-Made Mascarpone, sustainable honey, bee pollen and crushed walnuts ($14); Salmon, pickle, house-made creme fraiche on Danish Rye ($14), Country Loaf ($11 for half, $18 for whole, estimated 1.2kg), and Miso Baguette.\nBreads are top-notch quality, while coffee is with partnership with Glasshouse. Starter Lab (Havelock Road)\nAlchemist\n2 MacTaggart Road, #01-01 Khong Guan Building, Singapore 368078\nOpening Hours: 8am \u2013 5pm Last Order 4:30pm (Mon \u2013 Fri); 9pm \u2013 6pm Last Order 5:30pm (Sat), Closed Sun\nHipster Cafe Within The Heritage Khong Guan Building\nYou may not have expected to find a hipster caf\u00e9 within this interesting and nostalgic building located where MacTaggart Road and Burn Road meets.\nAs you look up to the top and read from right to left, you would notice the words \u5eb7\u5143 which means Khong Guan.\nAlchemist started out as small takeaway coffee outpost in the CBD. This 3rd outlet is their flagship store where they house the coffee roasters at the back, and an island-open concept coffee bar at the front.\nThey continue to source for their own coffee, roast them, and then focus on making it simple and approachable to our customers.\nI also liked the environment, not as echoey as expected, with various seating arrangements, and decorative traces of the old heritage building. Just look at the flooring. Alchemist (MacTaggart Road)\nApollo Coffee Bar\n65 Serangoon Garden Way, Singapore 555961\nOpening Hours: 9am \u2013 10pm (Tue \u2013 Sat), 9am \u2013 7pm (Sun), Closed Mon\nMediterranean-Inspired Brunch Caf\u00e9 Opens At Serangoon Garden\nBy the people behind Atlas Coffeehouse , Lunar Coffee Brewers and Columbus Coffee Co. , the team have got their formula quite right with every venture, by coming up with variance of industrial chic dining environment coupled with creative food offerings to satisfy caf\u00e9 hopper\u2019s interest.\nThe food menu at Apollo are mostly new creations and inspired from Mediterranean origins. They are also categorized into SMALL and LARGE plates to promote communal dining.\nI took a liking to the recommended Pork & Pear Tartine ($19.50) which came with roasted pears, bacon chunks, caramelized onions and ricotta cheese spread on a bed of fluffy ciabatta bread.\nExclusive to Apollo Coffee Bar is the Dark Chocolate and Miso Caramel Softserve ($7). I prefer the latter which has an interesting blend of salty miso and sweet caramel flavour. Apollo Coffee Bar (Serangoon Garden)\nBacha Coffee\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nGorgeous Moroccan Themed Coffee Boutique & Brunch Place\nThis is the Moroccan brand\u2019s first international outpost, specialising in coffee from single origins, coffee blends as well as flavoured coffee.\nPeople think the concept is like TWG, but coffee version.\nThere are over 200 to choose from, and so you can come almost every day in a year if variety is what you crave. While the coffee selection may look overwhelming at first, they do include the taste profile and strength, and the serving staff can guide you along to make a preferred selection.\nThe d\u00e9cor itself is striking, designed to reflect the Moroccan Dar el Bacha palace in Marrakech. Some customers take the opportunity to strike a pose, some repeatedly and too many.\nAs for food, perhaps the more unique and Moroccan style dishes left a better impression, such as the Morrocan Chicken Pastilla infused with Rosenheim Coffee ($24), and Moroccan Kefta Meatballs accompanied with straw potato fries ($28). Bacha Coffee (ION Orchard)\nKafe Utu\nTel: +65 6996 3937\nOpening Hours: 8am \u2013 5pm (Wed \u2013 Sun), 6pm \u2013 11pm (Wed, Thurs, Sun), 6pm \u2013 1am (Fri, Sat) Closed Mon, Tues\n1st African Themed Caf\u00e9 In Singapore\nKafe Utu is listed first because it dares to be bold, different, and sticks true to its theme. How many African themed places in Singapore can you find?\nThe attention to details\u2026 from the menu design, sofa, cushions, decorations, paintings, doors to even the panels, you know a lot of thought has been put into the collection and planning of the space.\nMany of the furniture (even the doors) used are specially imported.\nKafe Utu serves up brunch items, East and West African food, as well as specialty coffee. Owner Kurt Wagner grew up in Kenya and wanted to bring a piece of home to Singapore.\nFood items on the menu include Swahili Fish Curry ($29) with red snapper, tamarind, coconut milk, house curry paste, habenero and coconut rice; Liberian Peanut Chicken Stew ($28); West African Spicy Greens ($28) with chicken thigh and smoked fish; and Caribbean Goat Curry ($28).\nIf you would prefer something safer and more familiar, go for the more \u2018brunchy\u2019 items such as Curried Avocado with Raw Garlic and Toast ($16) and Ricotta Hotcakes ($23).\nKafe Utu has really been on the radar, but its attention to details makes it a name to be mentioned. Kafe Utu (Jiak Chuan Road)\nGlyph Supply Co\nOpening Hours: 8:30am \u2013 8:30pm (Mon \u2013 Fri), 10am \u2013 8:30pm (Sat \u2013 Sun)\nMinimalist White Caf\u00e9 Found At Somerset\nGlyph Supply Co. has been attracting quite a fair bit of customers, because it is an artisanal caf\u00e9 with quite an \u201cinstagrammable\u201d interior.\nCoffee is priced at $4.50 for the black, $5.50 for the white, Coldbrew at $6.00, while iced versions cost $1 extra. For non-coffee drinkers, there is also offering of Matcha ($6.00) and Chocolate ($6.00).\nThis is slightly pricier than what you find in other hipster cafes in the neighbourhoods, but I suppose they have high rentals to pay.\nBakes are from Carpenter & Cook, and you get a rotational selection from Lemon Tart, Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel Tart, Passionfruit Meringue Tart, Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat, to savoury bites of Mushroom Quiche, and Ham and Cheese Croissant.\nQuality coffee you can find at this part of town, plus it is considered slightly hidden. Glyph Supply Co. (TripleOne Somerset)\nPPP Coffee by Papa Palheta\nFunan #02-19, 107 North Bridge Road Singapore 179105\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nPapa Palehta rebrands to PPP Coffee\nWe have not heard from specialty coffee roaster Papa Palheta in a while. The group who is also behind the famous hipster coffee place Chye Seng Huat Hardware, launched Singapore\u2019s first employee-store PPP Coffee. That means a portion of the profits will go to the staff.\nThe revamped Funan has quite a number of coffee places, but PPP Coffee stands up for its quality control and modern outlook.\nA highlight of the space is an experiential brew bar for customers to have a go at brewing and interacting with coffee apparatus\nThe selection also incorporates some local Nonya Kuehs and other locally inspired cakes, and you can look out for the Ondeh Ondeh ($5 for 5 pieces) with coffee infused gula melaka filling. PPP Coffee (Funan)\nCafe De Nicole\u2019s Flower\n224 Telok Kurau Rd, #01-01, Singapore 423836\nOpening Hours: 8.30am \u2013 8.30pm (Tue \u2013 Sun), Closed Mon\nFloral-Themed Caf\u00e9 With Souffl\u00e9 Pancakes\nWhile many new cafes in Singapore has gone for a minimalist or industrial concept, Cafe De Nicole\u2019s Flower focuses on a garden theme.\nAnd this is not just about the aesthetical aspect but also through its presentation and scent.\nBeing a florist shop, an event space, a workshop venue and an animal playground (yes, it\u2019s pets friendly too!), the interior is like a garden with its pleasing floral scent in almost every part of the space.\nSomething that caught my attention is the addition of flowers, be it dried or fresh flowers, in all the desserts and drinks that I ordered.\nEven though the souffle pancakes may not seem as tall, wobbly or bouncy (worthy for a Boomerang shot), this plate of souffl\u00e9 pancakes is a piece of art on its own, with sauces, fruits and flowers used for plating. Cafe De Nicole\u2019s Flower (Telok Kurau Road)\nBaristart Coffee Singapore\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nHokkaido Cafe With Delicious Cream Puff\nIt is the first caf\u00e9 here to offer coffee using the popular Brown Jersey Milk from Biei, a small town in Hokkaido, Japan.\nThis is matched with beautiful latte art; its food and desserts.\nThe desserts, all made in-house, are designed by the talented pastry Chef Emi Sasaki with the support of local chefs whom had spent several weeks of intensive training in Japan.\nMost would head for the Shiro Kuma ($9.80). Shaped like a bear, Shiro Kuma is a shaved ice dessert is too adorable to destroy and eat. This much-talked about item is served with a glass of Hokkaido BIEI Jersey Milk, so you can drizzle a little or pour as much as you like.\nYou can also opt for other homemade syrups instead of the milk, i.e. Coffee, Strawberry, Mango, and Green tea for your preferred flavour.\nAlso, can I add that its Cream Puff is one of the best I tried in Singapore?

Flavours include Japanese Whiskey, Caramel Walnut, Soba-Cha (interesting), Matcha Milk, Sweet Potato, Hoji-cha and Black Sesame.\nThe Goma I dare say with its rich and intense flavour, is possibly THE BEST black sesame gelato I had in Singapore.\nThe picturesque Matcha Mont Blanc ($9.00) with Japanese chestnut paste is my personal favourite; while Matcha Mille Feuille ($9.00) with matcha butter, custard and sweet chestnut are both art-on-a-plate.

            "16 Nasi Lemak in Singapore for The Ultimate Indulgence\nLast updated on October 4th, 2018,\nMost of our childhood is stored not in photos, but in certain smells and places \u2026 Nasi Lemak is one of Singaporeans\u2019 favourite dishes, and we grew up having this, hence our particular fondness for this indulgent plate of rice. There are two types of nasi lemak commonly found today \u2013 the Malay version with ikan billis, nuts, ikan kuning (fried fish), fried egg and cucumber slices, as well as, the Chinese version which offers a lot more variety in side dishes ranging from fried chicken drumsticks to luncheon meat\u00a0to\u00a0an assortment of vegetables.\nIt\u2019s not just the ingredients that makes a good nasi lemak. Pandan leaves and coconut milk play a huge role in enhancing the fragrance and richness of the rice, complemented by the spicy sambal chilli sauce that you can\u2019t miss out on. We hunted down 16 fantastic places for you to try!\nThe Coconut Club\nThe Coconut Club at Ann Siang Hill brought the standard of nasi lemak back with the use of quality ingredients. Little wonder why our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hosted visiting Philippine President Rodrigo D\u00e9tente here for lunch! Our plate of Nasi Lemak ($12.80) is really lemak with a rich fragrance. Using basmati rice grains, the rice we had that day was dense and a little chewy.\nThe Coconut Club\u2019s standard nasi lemak includes coconut rice, ikan bilis, sambal chilli, cucumber, fried egg and fried chicken leg. Optional add-ons\u00a0include beef rendang, otak and fried fish. We really like the chicken leg marinated with galangal, lemongrass and ginger. The chicken leg is first coated with tapioca flour before it is\u00a0deep fried, resulting in a crispy skin with very moist and juicy meat. However, the sambal chilli needs a little more punch.\nThe Coconut Club\nPhone: 6635 2999\nOpening Hours: Tue-Sat 11am to 3pm. Closed on Mondays and Sundays.\nQuan Jia Fu (\u5168\u4f73\u798f) Nasi Lemak\nSet up by popular ge tai singer Cheng Ze (\u627f\u6cfd) and two other partners, Quan Jia Fu Nasi Lemak in Army Market is gaining quite a crowd. One of the partners used to be a cook in a nasi lemak stall in Boon Lay so she takes care of all the cooking while the two handsome young man do most of the serving. Its rice is milder in coconut milk flavour, but is light and fluffy.\nWhat really stands out is the sambal, which has a strong taste of dried shrimp in the blend. It\u2019s really robust in flavours, spicy with a strong presence of shallots. The fried chicken is crispy and\u00a0goes well with the sambal dip which\u00a0we paired with curry vegetables and an egg omelette too. We love the old school vibes which exude from the rustic-looking metal plates which we used to use\u00a0in the past. Old vintage milo tins are also hung on the ceiling and used as their cash box.\nQuan Jia Fu Nasi Lemak\nAddress: #B1-45, Golden Mile Food Centre, 505 Beach Road, Singapore 199583\nOpening Hours: Tue-Sun 10am to 6pm. Closed on Mondays.\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/quanjiafunasilemak/\nRevolution Cafe\nCelebrity Mod Sin Chef Shen Tan is famous for her nasi lemak, which is steamed with fresh coconut every day \u00a0instead of being thrown into a rice cooker with coconut milk. Only the best Fragrant Jasmine rice is used and each grain of rice is distinct and fluffy but richly lemak and deserves to be called Nasi Lemak! It is so well flavoured that you will want to eat the rice on its own! The 5 Nasi Lemak rice sets feature dishes such as crispy pork, crispy fried chicken, 5 spice pork confit, beef rendang and chicken rendang. Instead of going for the usual beef rendang, we opted\u00a0for the crispy pork instead. It\u2019s so crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.\nRevolution Cafe\nOpening Hours: 9am to 6pm daily.\nBoon Lay Power Nasi Lemak\nWith a snaking long queue of customers eagerly waiting to place their order, it is hard to miss this stall. This stall still maintains the freshness of their nasi lemak ingredients and makes sure that their food is kept sizzling hot. The well-marinated chicken is deep-fried to a nice crispiness but maintains its tenderness on the inside. Fried ikan bilis and roasted peanuts are nicely done too. The otah paste is splendid with add-on coconut milk. It wasn\u2019t too spicy but enough to give a kick. We could feel the enticing coconut aroma rising up from the fragrant rice and the sambal chilli \u2013 ooh, it was sensational. Despite the crowd, their standard seemed to have dipped over the years.\nBoon Lay Power Nasi Lemak\nAddress: #01-106, Boon Lay Food Village, 221B Boon Lay Place, Singapore 642221\nMobile: 9006 4730\nMizzy Corner\nEveryone who frequents Changi Village would know about the nasi lemak served at Mizzy\u2019s Corner. Although it is said that anyone would invariably leave with very satisfied tummies, we didn\u2019t think this was the best nasi lemak in Singapore. The standard chicken nasi lemak set costs $3.50 and comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg and ikan bilis, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1. Such a very value for money meal!\nMizzy Corner\nAddress: #01-26, Changi Village Market and Food Centre, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002\nOpening Hours: Mon-Thu 7am to 11pm. Fri, Sat & Sun 24 hours.\nTan Beng Otah Delights\nOtah here is prepared on the spot and freshly wrapped. The otah has a good balance of chilli and fish and exudes ethereal fragrance when served hot. The filling within contains chunks of mackerel meat and the spices pack quite a punch. What we enjoyed most was the packet of traditional nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaves that this hawker still prepares. Consisting of fried fish, an egg, ikan bilis and peanuts, it made me reminisce the days when my late grandmother would tabao this back for me on weekends for breakfast when I was much younger.\nTan Beng Otah Delights\nAddress: #01-74, Old Airport Road Food Centre, 51 Old Airport Road, Singapore 390051\nOpening Hours: Mon-Fri 10am to 4pm. Sat&Sun 7am to 4pm. Closed on Wednesdays.\nSri Sujana Muslim Food\nThe standard chicken nasi lemak set which costs $3.50, comes with a fried chicken wing, a fried egg, ikan bilis, sambal and a slice of cucumber. Unfortunately, the rice is not fragrant enough and it is too soggy. However, we quite enjoyed the sambal here. While some sambal tends to be sweeter, Sri Sujana\u2019s version is spicy enough and is fragrant enough. Their ikan bilis was also super crispy and still hot. The chicken wings have a nice crispy skin. A piece of mackerel otak otak can be added for an additional $1. We queued for 20 mins or longer for just two plates of nasi lemak. Actually, the diners mostly only buy 1 to 2 plates of nasi lemak. Service is really slow.\nSri Sujana Muslim Food\nAddress: #01-30, Changi Village Market and Food Centre, 2 Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002\nOpening Hours: Tue-Sun 8am to 2am. Closed on Mondays.\nSelera Rasa Nasi Lemak\nSelera Rasa Nasi Lemak at Adam Food Centre has been labelled as one of the best Nasi Lemak in Singapore. Food comes in sets, with prices ranging from $2.50 to $5.50, depending on the ingredients you order. We ordered their \u201cRoyal Rumble\u201d ($5.50) which consisted of Potato Croquette, Fried Egg, Deep-fried fish, Ikan Bilis, Otah and Deep-fried chicken wing. Our verdict? We have to agree that the rice was fragrant and well-enriched by the coconut milk. They use Basmati Rice which has a lighter texture and better flavour, and the grains are wonderfully separated. Expect a queue at this stall, but it\u2019s worth the wait!\nAddress: Stall #02, Adam Food Centre, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876\nOpening Hours: 7am to 5pm. Closed on Fridays.\nNo. 1 Adam\u2019s Nasi Lemak\nLocated just beside Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak, we have to say that each stall has their own specialty. No. 1 Adam\u2019s Nasi Lemak\u2019s specialty lies in the mutton rendang, which possesses a thick, yet sweet gravy. The meat is tender and juicy. The fish cake had a bouncy texture while the otah was soft and tasty. We like the flavourful potato too. The highlight though, has to be the sambal chilli. It\u2019s a tad sweet, not too spicy and very appetizing. Do note that the waiting time during lunch hours can take up to 60 minutes as many people would takeaway about 10 to 15 packets each.\nNo. 1 Adam\u2019s Nasi Lemak\nAddress: Stall #01, Adam Food Centre, 2 Adam Road, Singapore 289876\nOpening Hours: 8.30am to 1pm. Closed on Tuesdays.\nFong Seng Fast Food Nasi Lemak\nFong Seng specialises in selling nasi lemak with the usual sides such as chicken wing, ikan bilis, peanuts, otah and egg etc. The chicken wing is fried to a perfect crisp golden brown while still retaining its tender, succulent meat within. The otah was fiery hot, with a hint of coconut milk to neutralise its spiciness. However, the rice served was normal steamed rice which Fong Seng makes up for by serving a plethora of other sides, which gives you a plate of hearty \u201ccai fan\u201d. There are a variety of vegetables, curry and various meats to choose from.\nFong Seng Fast Food Nasi Lemak\nAddress: 22 Clementi Road, Singapore 129751\nOpening Hours: 24 hours daily.\nHon Ni Kitchen\nHon Ni has two stalls in the hawker centre, one to prepare the ingredients while the other to serve from. It sells nasi lemak at a very cheap price. While the must-order is chicken wing, they also have other dishes such as luncheon meat, fried kuning fish, fishcakes, stir fry long beans, ikan bilis, otah, fried eggs etc. The nasi is very light and fluffy because they use coconut milk sparingly. The rice is best eaten with their homemade sambal chilli sauce, which is made of fresh chilli, onions and ikan bilis. Very shiok! And many have raved about their delicious otah which is silky smooth and without a fishy smell. Be sure to try it out!\nHon Ni Kitchen\nAddress: #01-07, Blk 216 Bedok North Street 1, Singapore 460216\nOpening Hours: Tue-Sat 7.30am to 2pm. Closed on Mondays and Sundays.\nChong Pang Nasi Lemak\nThis famed establishment had its humble beginnings in the former Chong Pang Village Hawker Centre in 1973 before moving to the current coffee shop situated along the busy Sembawang Road. Serving Chinese-style Nasi Lemak with an array of dishes to choose from, the rice is light and not heavy on coconut milk. Of all the sides, the best-selling item is the chicken wings. Lightly battered and well marinated, each bite had a good crunch, with juicy, tender meat. The chilli packs a good punch and finishes on a tangy note.\nPhone: 6756 0048\nPunggol Nasi Lemak\nRun by family members, Punggol Nasi Lemak is a favourite supper spot for many. I\u2019ve been frequenting the outlet near Kovan for many years and there\u2019s always a long queue during dinner hours. The aroma of their good quality rice is accentuated by coconut and pandan. Each grain is consistent, neither too mushy nor too hard. The eggs here are prepared just right, with a runny yolk in the middle surrounded by crispy, browned edges. The chicken wings are worth your calories too! They are crispy and succulent, even with such a high turnover. The sambal chilli is not too spicy and has a hint of sweetness. There are sides like otah, sambal belachan long beans, fish cakes and many more, which could be packed away for dinner.\nPunggol Nasi Lemak\nPhone: 6281 0020\nMarket Street Nasi Lemak\nLocated at the hawker centre in the CBD, it\u2019s hard to miss this stall when the queue is always snaking during lunch time. Run by two brothers, they are very efficient and offer a wide selection of items to choose from at very reasonable prices. At $2.50, our plate consisted of fragrant rice, fried chicken drumstick, fish fillet, otah, egg and ikan billis. What a steal! The chicken wings and chicken drumsticks were not too greasy and were fried to a crisp golden brown, while retaining its tender meat within. The rice was palatable, with a strong coconut aroma. If you work in the CBD and don\u2019t mind queuing, this is definitely a wallet-friendly stall you can frequent.\nMarket Street Nasi Lemak\nAddress: #02-24, Golden Shoe Carpark, 50 Market Street, Singapore 048940\nOpening Hours: Mon-Fri 8.30am to 7.30pm. Sat 8.30am to 3pm. Closed on Sundays.\nBali Nasi Lemak\nAunty Susan came from a family selling nasi lemak. Her eldest sister is the owner of the famous Punggol Nasi Lemak while her second sister is the owner of Mt Faber Nasi Lemak. Even so, each stall has their own specialty. Here, the Kicap Manis Fried Chicken is their specialty. They deep fried the chicken wings with rice and wheat flour to hold that crispiness. You can have it in original or the kecap manis version which is tossed with sweet black sauce. They also serve unique dishes like sambal petai, otah, brinjal etc. Obviously no complaints about her rice, the Thai basmati rice is fluffy and lemak just like her sisters\u2019.\nBali Nasi Lemak\nLatiffa Huri\nA plate of Nasi Lemak, with an added Otah costs $4.80, and consists of chicken wing fried to a crisp golden brown, ikan kuning, an egg omelette, cucumber and their sambal chilli. The rice boasts a coconuty aroma, and the texture of each grain is consistent. We love the chicken wing with its crispy exterior and tender meat. Ikan kuning also accentuated the savouriness of this nasi lemak. Coupled with the shiok sambal chilli, this nasi lemak is so satisfying!\nLatiffa Huri\nAddress: #01-426, 7 Stars Coffee Shop, 498 Jurong West Street 41, Singapore 640498\nOpening Hours: 5.30am to 2pm, or till sold out.\nMissTamChiak.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the stalls featured here.\nLet\u2019s build a food community that helps to update the food news in Singapore!

            "It\u2019s all over Facebook, Instagram and every other social media platform you see \u2013 it\u2019s Dalgona Coffee. Dalgona is actually a traditional Korean candy that is made with sugar and baking soda to form a caramel consistency, where after that it is hardened and shapes are pressed into it. When you whip the coffee up, it also resembles the texture of molten dalgona candy, hence the name!\nWe\u2019ve narrowed down these three simple steps such that you can also enjoy this viral drink everyone seems to be having. It\u2019s definitely a lot easier than you think!\nStep 1: The ratios are super simple \u2013 1:1:1! Add 2 tablespoons of instant coffee, sugar and hot water into a bowl.\nStep 2: Mix with a whisk by hand (and risk feeling the ache for 3 days after) or just grab a small hand-mixer and let it do the work for you. You should see it turn a lighter brown as it gets foamier! Whip it until it reaches a whipped cream-like consistency.\nStep 3: Add ice and milk to a cup and pour your dalgona whip over it. Mix it thoroughly to enjoy!\nPro-Tips:\nSometimes Singapore can get a little hot so if your coffee doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s thickening, stick it in the fridge for around 10 to 15 minutes and try whipping it up again. Patience is key when whipping this.\nThe foam whips up from the amount of sugar added so if you reduce the amount of sugar, it might not be as thick and foamy as seen in a lot of videos. But the taste will still be pretty good!\nCATEGORIES & TAGS\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nYou may use these HTML tags and attributes: <a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <strike> <strong>\nDesigned & Developed by PRODDDesign .\n"

Alternatively, dry-toast 50 gm whole white peppercorns in a non-stick pan, until it releases its aroma, it slightly darkens in colour and chars in some areas.\n1-2 tsp highest quality dark soy sauce\nCondiment: Cilicuka (Original, Extra Hot or Super Hot)\nOptional: serve with coriander leaves as a garnish, Chinese doughstick (youtiao) on the side.\nMETHOD:\nCut the tops off 2 whole garlic bulbs. Leave the skins on. Set aside for use later.\nCut the baby pork ribs into pieces, slice in between the bones.\nTransfer the pieces of pork into a pot, cover with water, then discard. This is to remove any possible bone fragments.\nFill the pot with water, just enough to cover the meat.\nBring to boil. Let the impurities (coagulated blood\u00a0and some fat) rise to the surface.\u00a0Discard this water. (This step is to blanch the pork and rid the meat of impurities, which results in a clearer soup.)\nAdd water, just enough to cover the meat. Add the 2 garlic bulbs and the Bak Kut Teh spice mix (mainly peppercorns).\nCover then bring to the boil again. Lower to a gentle simmer then cover. (Low and slow simmering is the trick to tender meat and well-flavoured soup stock.)\u00a0Uncover every 15 mins to scoop up any impurities. Use a fine mesh sieve. (This is what results in a clear soup.)\nOnce it has simmered for a total of 45-60 mins, pierce the meat with a fork or knife to check for its tenderness. Taste the soup to check the seasoning. Add 1 to 2 tsp dark soy sauce, which add saltiness and richness to the flavour. It also helps to darken the colour of the pale soup.\nIn an individual soup serving bowl, transfer a few pieces of meat, then cover with the soup stock. Serve with Cilicuka (Original, Extra Hot or Super Hot) on the side, as a dipping sauce.\nThe soup can be garnished with coriander sprigs for colour, and served with white rice and/or Chinese doughsticks (youtiao).\nShop Now To Make Your Own Super-Easy Bak Kut Teh\nWe stock all the key sauces, sambals & marinades that you need to recreate this dish\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail address:\nCopyright \u00a9 2020.

            "Many reviews have been singing huge praises for Wolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse, opened at Intercontinental Singapore Nanson Road (NOT Bugis).\nFew would still confuse this Wolfgang with another Wolfgang. This Steakhouse is started by Wolfgang Zwiener, while one-Michelin starred CUT at Marina Bay Sands is by Wolfgang Puck.\nThe original Wolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse opened on New York City\u2019s Park Avenue in 2004, and has since grown into an internationally renowned steak institution, with 18 branches worldwide.\nThere are comparisons between Wolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse and the famed Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. It is interesting to know that Wolfgang Zwiener used to be the head waiter from Peter Luger.\nWolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse is famous for its USDA Prime 28 days dry-aged steak.\nThe process of dry-aging helps reduce moisture from the muscle, resulting in greater concentration of beef flavour and taste. Also, the beef\u2019s natural enzymes can break down the connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender meat.\nFor appetisers, soups and salads, the recommended include Seafood Platter ($50) \u2013 like almost every other day was ordering one, Wolfgang\u2019s Crab Cake ($38), Tuna Tartar ($38), Lobster Bisque ($22), and Wolfgang\u2019s Salad ($25).\nThe Lobster Bisque was ($22) smooth and lightly creamer, with little pieces of lobsters sporadically.\nCertainly above the average, but I thought it lacked that complex flavour and distinct brandy profile to make it a really memorable broth.\nFor steak selection, the menu includes New York Sirloin ($99), Rib Eye Steak ($118), and Porterhouse Steak meant for two, three or four diners ($185, $275, $360).\nI ordered the Porterhouse Steak for Two ($185), and thought that weight should have been indicated in the menu. I checked with the waiter and the bone-in steak was about 800 grams.\nCertified USDA Prime beef is used, dry-aged for 28 days in-house in an aging box, then cooked with a specialised 900\u00b0C broiler.\nThe steak arrived sizzling hot, with the sounds of the bubbling oils extremely enticing. Be careful not to touch the plate.\nThe Porterhouse would include two parts, a more buttery tender tenderloin, and short loin which is leaner and beefier.\nSurprisingly, I liked the sirloin part which was lean yet still held rather complex flavours. While it was not melt-in-your-mouth tender, the pieces had good amount of fat and succulence.\nA huge part of the positive reviews for this restaurant have to do with the service.\nIn Singapore, service standards have declined for several restaurants, even fine dining ones due to labour crunch and lack of training (amongst other reasons).\nHaving a team of people greet you, attend to your needs, make adequate recommendations (and not smoking the way through), with that sincere body language, has become far and between.\nThroughout the meal, there would always be a serving staff asking, \u201dHow\u2019s the meal?\u201d, though my dining partner commented that some local diners appeared genuinely uncomfortable being engaged in conversations.\nEven though I didn\u2019t order that much, the bill came up to be more than $150 per person.\nReservation at Wolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse is encouraged. Do note that the main dining room could get slightly noisy when it is full-house, but there are seats slightly further away if you need conversations.\nWolfgang\u2019s Steakhouse by Wolfgang Zwiener\n1 Nanson Road #02-01 Intercontinental Singapore, Singapore 238909\nOpening Hours: 11:30am \u2013 11:30pm\nTAGS\nYou have entered an incorrect email address!\nPlease enter your email address here\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nCurrent ye@r *\nRecent Posts\nFeaturing local cuisine, gourmet food, international restaurants and more, DanielFoodDiary.com introduces some of the best food and dining experiences in Singapore and around the world.\nFOLLOW US\n\u00a9 DanielFoodDiary.com Copyright \u00a9 2019.

            "Kobe beef (\u795e\u6238\u30d3\u30fc\u30d5, K\u014dbe b\u012bfu)\npronounced\n[ko\u02d0be bi\u02d0\u0278\u026f] is Wagyu beef from the Tajima strain of Japanese Black cattle, raised in Japan 's Hy\u014dgo Prefecture according to rules set out by the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association. [1] The meat is a delicacy , valued for its flavor, tenderness, and fatty, well- marbled texture . Kobe beef can be prepared as steak , sukiyaki , shabu-shabu , sashimi , and teppanyaki . Kobe beef is generally considered one of the three top brands (known as Sandai Wagyu, \"the three big beefs\"), along with Matsusaka beef and \u014cmi beef or Yonezawa beef .\nKobe beef is also called Kobe niku (\u795e\u6238\u8089, \"Kobe meat\"), Kobe-gyu (\u795e\u6238\u725b) or Kobe-ushi (\u795e\u6238\u725b, \"Kobe cattle\") in Japanese . [1]\nContents\nTajima cattle on a Hy\u014dgo farm\nTajima cattle on a Hy\u014dgo farm\nCattle were brought to Japan from China at the same time as the cultivation of rice , in about the second century AD, in the Yayoi period . [2] :209 Until about the time of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, they were used only as draught animals , in agriculture , forestry , mining and for transport, and as a source of fertiliser . Milk consumption was unknown, and \u2013 for cultural and religious reasons \u2013 meat was not eaten. [3] :2 [4] [5]\nJapan was effectively isolated from the rest of the world from 1635 until 1854; there was no possibility of intromission of foreign genes to the cattle population during this time. Between 1868, the year of the Meiji Restoration , and 1887, some 2600 foreign cattle were imported, including Braunvieh , Shorthorn , and Devon . [3] :8 [6] Between about 1900 and 1910 there was extensive cross-breeding of these with native stock. From 1919, the various heterogeneous regional populations that resulted from this brief period of cross-breeding were registered and selected as \"Improved Japanese Cattle\". Four separate strains were characterized, based mainly on which type of foreign cattle had most influenced the hybrids, and were recognized as breeds in 1944. These were the four wagy\u016b breeds, the Japanese Black , the Japanese Brown , the Japanese Polled and the Japanese Shorthorn . [3] :8 [6] The Tajima is a strain of the Japanese Black, the most populous breed (around 90% of the four breeds). [7] [8]\nBeef consumption remained low until after World War II . Kobe beef grew in popularity and extended its global reach in the 1980s and 1990s. [9]\nIn 1983, the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association was formed to define and promote the Kobe trademark . It sets standards for animals to be labeled as Kobe beef. [10]\nIn 2009, the USDA placed a ban on the import of all Japanese beef to prevent the Japan foot-and-mouth outbreak from reaching US shores. The ban was relaxed in August 2012. Shortly thereafter, Kobe beef was imported into the US for the first time. [11]\nHy\u014dgo prefecture, where authentic Kobe beef is produced\nKobe beef in Japan is a registered trademark of the Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association (\u795e\u6238\u8089\u6d41\u901a\u63a8\u9032\u5354\u8b70\u4f1a, K\u014dbeniku Ry\u016bts\u016b Suishin Ky\u014dgikai). [12] It must fulfill all the following conditions: [1]\nFarm feeding in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture\nBullock (steer or castrated bull)\nMarbling ratio, called BMS, of level 6 and above [13]\nMeat quality score of 4 or 5, [13] yield grade A or B [6]\nCarcase weight of 499.9 kg or less. [6]\nThe cattle are fed on grain fodder and brushed sometimes for setting fur. [14] [15] The melting point of fat of Kobe beef (Tajima cattle) is lower than common beef fat. [16]\nKobe beef is expensive, partly because only about 3000 head of cattle may qualify as Kobe per year. [6] In Japan, all cattle, including those approved as Kobe beef, can be tracked via a 10-digit number through every step of their entire life cycle. [17]\nKobe beef was not exported until 2012. It was exported in January 2012 to Macau , then to Hong Kong in July 2012. [18] Since then, exports have also been made to the United States , Singapore , Thailand [19] , the United Kingdom [20] and one chef in Canada . [21]\nIn some countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, Wagyu cattle imported from Japan are farmed, either purebred or cross-bred with other beef breeds such as Aberdeen Angus . In some places meat from these cattle may be marketed under names such as \"Kobe-style beef\"; it is not Kobe beef, and does not fulfil the requirements for certification of the authentic Japanese product. [22] [23] Due to a lack of legal recognition of the Kobe beef trademark in the United States, it is also possible to sell this meat as \"Kobe beef\". [24] [25] The Kobe Beef Marketing and Distribution Promotion Association planned to publish pamphlets about Kobe beef in foreign languages. [26]\nAmerican \"Kobe-style\" beef tends to be darker and stronger-tasting than the authentic product. [27] It may have more appeal to Western palates unfamiliar with the mild taste and high fat content of true Kobe beef. [7]\nMeghan Staley. \"Kobe Beef\" . Trade Environment Database.

            "Posted on September 19, 2017 by theRantingPanda in Food\nThe Place It doesn\u2019t feel that long but PS.Cafe has already been around for eighteen years. The popular and one of the most pioneer brand to enter the caf\u00e9 scene in Singapore recently opened a gorgeous ninth outlet at One Fullerton, taking over the space of the now defunct UsQuBa. Our first impression when we stepped in \u2013 this must be one of the most inviting and beautiful waterfront facing restaurant in Singapore.\nAs with all PS.Cafe outlets, every branch is unique in its interior. I like the fact that PS.Cafe at One Fullerton has a few distinct dining areas to dine in \u2013 the outdoor terrace overlooking the waterfront, a private room which seats up to ten diners, a main indoor dining area decked in leather seats and another indoor section which overlooks Marina Bay Sands.\nThe Food I can\u2019t forget PS.Cafe Truffle Fries, that\u2019s too deeply etched in my memories. Other than the classic dishes, the outlet at One Fullerton also caters to the CBD crowd with its two-course Executive Menu priced at S$34++.\u00a0Some of the exclusive new dishes to expect at this outlet include the Chargrilled Skate with green harissa and broccolini,\u00a0Moules Vin Blanc with crusty dipping bread and Chargrilled Chunky Prawn Sandwich with spiced pickled mango, kaffir lime aioli, shoestring fries and house sourdough.\nAn obligatory start with the PS. Truffle Shoestring Fries (S$15). This must be the best truffle fries in town, and look at that generous mountain portion.\nA soup to start as well, the Portobello Mushroom (S$14) has a dense texture and is served along with generous portions of garlic bread to dip in.\nBeing one of the exclusive item on the menu at One Fullerton, this Chargrilled Skate (S$34) with green harissa and broccolini is a twist from the sambal version we are all familiar with.\nThe other mains we had was the Steak & Beef Dripping Mash (S$39) served with porcini gravy where we opted for the 180g Corn-Fed Petite Tender. I was pleasantly surprised by how succulent the steak was, very well-marinated and retained that juicy texture and flavour and went along well with the porcini gravy.\nFor desserts, we enjoyed the Chendol Sundae (S$15), with three scoops of coconut ice cream drenched with Gula Melaka. It wasn\u2019t too sweet for me, highly recommended if you are a fan of this local dessert.\nRants The prices at PS.Cafe ain\u2019t that affordable.\nWill I Return Again? Love the ambience here, and the food quality has been consistently good. Some teething issue noted during our meal, although the overall service was rather spot on. Will be back for the truffle fries and their desserts, that\u2019s for sure.\nThis was an invited tasting, though all opinions expressed are our own.\nTheRantingPanda says:\nAmbience: 4/5\nRanted by The Ranter\nGood things must share:\n2 Trackbacks / Pingbacks\nEnter your comment here...\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\nEmail (Address never made public)\nName\nWebsite\nYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

            "During the last year or so, Bubble Tea has enjoyed a new round of resurgence in Singapore.\nPeople who grew up in the \u2018era\u2019 of Quickly, Cool Station and Milk Girl (gosh, I feel old), would find this all so, so familiar.\nExcept that \u201cBubble Tea\u201d takes on slightly different form, with more fanciful packaging, colours, and variants from Brown Sugar Milk Tea , Fruit Teas , and Cheese Teas .\nIt is NOT over. From the grapevine, a fee more are heading here.\nSome openings are well, more low-profile than others, ie they can be a prominent name in Taiwan and elsewhere, but quiet in Singapore (though I think their drinks are not bad). There were some Fruit Tea shops that opened with a \u201cbang\u201d, but are feeling the heat of the competition.\nThese are 13 famous bubble/cheese tea brands that have arrived to Singapore:\nHEYTEA Singapore\nION Orchard Mall, 2 Orchard Turn, #B4-29, Singapore 238801 (Orchard MRT)\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm\nHEYTEA \u559c\u8336 which is China\u2019s most popular tea brand, launched its 1st overseas shop in Singapore, right at ION Orchard basement 4. Its 2nd brand is at Clarke Quay, known for its alcoholic Bubble Tea \u2013 I am still not quite sure about that.\nThey are THE original creators of the iconic \u201ccheese tea\u201d (not anyone else), which has gained fame around the world.\nYou have probably seen other tea brands with similar drinking-boy logos, but THIS is the real McCoy.\nAs for the menu in HEYTEA, they offer a wide range of offerings catering to different palates: Cheezo Tea, Pure Tea, Berry Mango Family, and Fruity Boom.\nThe recommended is the King Fone Cheezo Tea ($5.50), which uses premium oolong tea leaves that have been specially harvested for HEYTEA.\nAs you drink the tea, you could taste that lingering oolong with some of that unique smokiness, as the tea leaves have undergone a special smoking process that brings out the fragrance. HEYTEA Singapore \u559c\u8336 (ION Orchard)\nThe Alley Singapore \u2013 Jewel Changi Airport\n78 Airport Boulevard Jewel Changi Airport #B2-273 Singapore 819666\nOpening Hours: 7am \u2013 12am (Mon \u2013 Thurs, Sat \u2013 Sun), 7am \u2013 1am (Fri)\nOther outlets at Orchard Cineleisure and Tampines 1\nThe Alley is a well-known Taiwanese beverage chain founded in Taichung, Taiwan in 2013.\nAfter 5 years, it has rapidly expanded to over 300 outlets around the world including Japan, Korea, France, Australia, USA, and finally to Singapore.\nThe brand, represented by an iconic large-antlered deer, is famous for Deerioca, The Alley\u2019s signature freshly-prepared hand-crafted tapioca pearls.\nManually measured, sifted, mixed and formed, the pearls achieve a better texture and aroma compared to its machine-produced counterparts.\nIts 3 signature drinks are the Brown Sugar Deerioca Fresh Milk ($5.30), Brown Sugar Deerioca Matcha Fresh Milk ($6.30), and Brown Sugar Deerioca Cocoa Milk ($6.30). The slightly sweet boba pearls are satisfying to the bite because of its texture. I found that the texture was just right \u2013 not too hard or soft.\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nOther outlets at Funan and Paya Lebar Quarter\nTaiwan\u2019s Leading Bubble Tea Brand Opening In Singapore\nMilksha \u8ff7\u5ba2\u590f also known as \u201cMilkshop\u201d, Taiwan\u2019s leading bubble tea that is voted No. 1 by Taiwan university students, has launched in Singapore at Suntec City and Funan.\nThis is also Milksha\u2019s first outlet in Southeast Asia.\nMilksha is known to use 100% natural fresh milk (no creamer) as well as other natural ingredients such as sugar from sugar cane for their products. No preservatives, chemical ingredients or artificial colourings.\nIts pearls are also quite unique, featuring honey pearls freshly cooked, frozen, then air-flown to Singapore. (Effort)\nIn Singapore, the brand will launch four series: Fresh Milk Series, Fresh Milk Tea Latte Series, Premium Tea Series and Special Concoctions. The five signatures include Azuki Matcha Milk, Fresh Taro Milk, Valrhona 100% Cocoa Milk, Refreshing Orange Green Tea and Earl Grey Latte with Honey Pearl.\nFor something special, get the Black Sesame Milk ($4.80), best for those who love goma. Milksha \u8ff7\u5ba2\u590f\nTiger Sugar Singapore \u2013 Orchard Paragon\nParagon Shopping Centre #B1-39/40, 290 Orchard Rd, Singapore 238859\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Last order 9.50pm)\nTiger Sugar Singapore \u2013 Capitol Singapore\nCapitol Singapore #B2-32, 13 Stamford Road, Singapore 178905\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nTiger Sugar Singapore \u2013 Chinatown Point\n133 New Bridge Road #B1-42 Singapore 059413\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nTiger Sugar \u8001\u864e\u5802 has quite a successful opening (s) in Singapore, at the basement of Capitol Singapore and Chinatown Point basement , and Orchard Paragon.\nThe \u201cTiger Sugar\u201d name came about from the \u2018tiger stripes\u2019 formed when the dark brown sugar syrup interacts with the thick milk in the cup.\nHowever, you cannot customise the sugar level, amount of ice or toppings, compared to all the other bubble tea brands.\nThe main best sellers are the Brown Sugar Boba Milk with Cream Mousse ($5.30), Brown Sugar Boba with Pearls with Cream Mousse ($5.30) and Brown Sugar Pearl Milk with Cream Mousse ($5.30).\nNayuki \u2013 Vivocity\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nWith over 180 stores across China and well-loved by celebrities, this flagship at Vivocity is Nayuki\u2019s 1st overseas outlet.\nThe key feature of Nayuki is that it pairs premium fresh-fruit teas and soft euro bread. The brand is considered the pioneer of this concept, inspiring a wave of tea bakeries across Asia.\nOriginating from Shenzhen, the brand is considered \u201chapz\u201d in China with photos of several of the products going viral on various social media channels such as Weibo.\nThis is also not just a takeaway kiosk, but a caf\u00e9 with stylish and comfortable sit-down area, where you can slowly sip tea and have bread.\nOther than the specialty \u201cSupreme Cheese Fruit Tea\u201d, other offerings you can expect include \u201cSupreme Fresh Fruit Tea\u201d, \u201cCheese Famous Tea\u201d, Pearl Fresh Milk Series, and Cold Brew Tea.\nThe recommended drink is the Supreme Cheese Strawberry ($8.30) which you can pair with bread. These strawberry products became so popular that the brand invested in a strawberry field to ensure premium strawberries of consistent quality are available all year round in China.\nOne of the few bubble tea (or should I say Cheese Tea) shops with a bakery in-house. Nayuki \u5948\u96ea\u306e\u8336 (Vivocity)\nThe Whale Tea \u2013 Lot One\nLot One Shoppers\u2019 Mall, 21 Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, #B1-25 Singapore 689812\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nThe Whale Tea \u2013 City Square Mall\nCity Square Mall, 180 Kitchener Road, #B2-K7, Singapore 208539\nFamous Bubble Tea Chain With Sapphire Blue Drinks & Souffl\u00e9 In Singapore\nThe Whale Tea \u7409\u7483\u9be8, one of the largest beverages and dessert stores in China, has arrived in Singapore and promises make a difference with its innovative signature drinks, soft serve with freshly-made cones, and fluffy souffl\u00e9 desserts.\nTaste-wise, you\u2019ll find an array of unique, healthy ingredients such as peach gum, spirulina, and Wuliangye, a Chinese baijiu made with a variety of grains.\nThey are known for The Volcanic Collagen Series includes cups of Volcanic Sapphire Whale, Milk Tea Lava, Passion Fruit Lava and Grapefruit Lava, all featuring peach gum as key ingredient.\nPeach gum? This is your alternative to the typical boba pearls. They are softer to the bite, somewhat like smaller pieces of jelly. The Whale Tea (Lot One)\nJenjudan Singapore \u73cd\u716e\u4e39\n1 CityLink Mall #B1-13 Singapore 039393\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nPopular Taiwanese bubble tea brand Jenjudan \u73cd\u716e\u4e39 has opened its first outlet in Singapore. The location is at CityLink Mall, #B1-13.\nThe menu\u2019s signature is the Brown Sugar Boba Milk ($5.20, $6.50), which features warm, soft brown sugar, and boba served with chilled fresh milk.\nIt was fun watching how a big scoop of the pearls were scooped up right before your eyes, stick and gooey and placed into the cup.\nCompared to some other prominent brands I tried in Taipei , the \u201cbrown-sugarness\u201d was considered more mellow, not as strong and full-flavoured. The boba though, had an agreeable, chewy bite.\nConsidering its fame in other cities, its momentum is considered slow in Singapore, probably due to its location and lack of marketing. Jenjudan Singapore \u73cd\u716e\u4e39 (CityLink Mall)\nTaiGai\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nEstablished in Shenzhen, TaiGai is a popular tea specialty brand in China with over 60 stores across the country, and is especially appealing to the youths. This is despite a competitive landscape where many international beverage chains are also aiming for a piece of the pie.\nThis NEX outlet in Singapore is its first overseas store.\nTaiGai is the original creator behind the \u201cFruity Milky Kiss\u201d \u2013 fruit-blended milk cheese crowns.\nEssentially, they are drinks topped with milk cheese foam that has been blended with fruits, which add that natural sweetness as you take sips especially from the top layer. TaiGai \u53f0\u76d6 (NEX)\nTP-Tea \u8336\u6e6f\u6703 Singapore \u2013 Changi Airport\nChangi Airport, Terminal 2, Departure Hall #026-015-01, Singapore 819643\nOpening Hours: 24 hours Daily\nChun Shui Tang \u6625\u6c34\u5802 is the parent company to the brand TP-Tea \u8336\u6e6f\u6703 which started in 2005, and TP Tea currently has over 300 outlets across the world.\nIts first outlet in Singapore opened at Changi Airport Terminal 2 Departure Hall, right next to Krispy Kreme and Llao Llao , and has become Singapore\u2019s FIRST 24 hours Taiwanese Bubble Tea Shop.\nThe bestseller and my personal favourite is the Tie Guan Yin Tea Latte ($4.60), which is a premium grade of Oolong Tea.\nCrushed ice is used in all their drinks, and the good news is that we get to choose the level of sweetness and the amount of ice for each cup. TP-Tea \u8336\u6e6f\u6703  (Changi Airport)\nTenRen Tea Singapore\nChinatown Point #01-07, 133 New Bridge Road Singapore 059413 (opposite McDonalds)\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nThis is one of Taiwan\u2019s leading tea chain TenRen\u2019s Tea \u5929\u4ec1\u8317\u8336 , with its first Singapore retail outlet at Chinatown Point.\nThe 800-square feet store at Chinatown Point offers bubble tea, traditional tea drinks, as well as tea leaves, snacks and teaware.\nIn Singapore, TenRen\u2019s menu features a range of ready-made drinks, including its signature 913 King\u2019s Oolong Tea Latte ($3.50 for medium, $4.90 for large), Orange Green Tea ($4.00 for medium, $5.60 for large) and Taro Green Tea Latte ($4.70 for medium, $6.50 for large).\nI find that their bubble tea has a particular tea fragrance that is very appealing, though they may not have as many exciting variants as compared to the \u2018younger\u2019 brands.\nTheir drinks also taste the \u2018healthiest\u2019 and are not too sweet. TenRen Tea \u5929\u4ec1\u8317\u8336 (Chinatown Point)\nCHICHA San Chen \u5403\u8336\u4e09\u5343\nOpening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nOriginating from Taichung, Taiwan, CHICHA San Chen  \u5403\u8336\u4e09\u5343  was founded in 1998 with a mission to make quality freshly brewed teas accessible to discerning tea drinkers.\nWhat is interesting is that they use a Teapresso machine that allows more than 1,000 custom settings and three-stage temperature control brewing technique to bring out the tea\u2019s best flavour and natural scent. So do prepared to wait a little while for your drinks.\nThe signature drinks here include Cassia Black Tea, High Mountain Pouchong Tea, Osmanthus Oolong Tea, Dong Ding Oolong Tea (My personal favourite is the Dong Ding Oolong Milk).\nPrice starts from $3.50 per cup.\nOnce customers have selected their tea base, they can layer the tea with a tropical note (passionfruit, mango, lemon juice), honey, or a creamy kick (cream, mousse, fresh milk); followed by a choice of topping (bubble, konjac).\nYifang Fruit Tea\nOpening Hours: 10:30am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nYifang serves up more than Fruit Tea here, also offering Tea Latte, Flavoured Tea and the trending Brown Sugar Pearl Latte.\nThere are two types of Brown Sugar drinks \u2013 Brown Sugar Pearl Latte ($5.30, $6.30), and Brown Sugar Pearl Black Tea Latte ($5.30, $6.30). Note that the sweetness and ice levels are fixed.\nFor the cup, you can experience \u2019gao gao\u2019 (rich) brown sugar that doesn\u2019t overkill on the sweetness level.\nThe way to take the perfect Instagram shot, is also to invert the drink over, and for the brown sugar to form patterns as it \u2018waterfalls\u2019 down.\nXing Fu Tang Singapore\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 10pm (Mon \u2013 Sun)\nXing Fu Tang\u2019s first Singapore outlet is located at Tampines Century Square.\nWhat is special is that the boba pearls are steeped in brown sugar, \u201cstir-fried\u201d in front of you, and scooped quickly into the cup.\nXing Fu Tang\u2019s Brown Sugar Boba Milk tasted creamier and richer than usual, even though it uses the same brand of milk as many other bubble tea shops in Singapore.\nI reckon it is due to the proportion of whipped cream.\nHowever, I could imagine some people finding this too heavy, \u2018jelak\u2019 and milky, especially if you finish a cup of your own after lunch.

            "Kam Long Curry Fish Head @ Johor Bahru. (Simply Delicious!)\nLast updated on January 4th, 2018,\nCurry fish head for breakfast? It may seems heavy for many of us, but Kam Long Curry Fish Head is probably one of the locations you want to skip lunch crowd. We took a 5 minutes short walk from City Square @ Johor Bahru and the place was already crowded even on a weekday morning.\nKam Long has been in business for more than 30 years. This is one of those unpretentious old school kopitiam eatery that only sells one dish \u2013 curry fish head. Many a time, I have seen how restaurants create a whole menu of 100 dishes, but never do a dish at its best. Sometimes, they are even unsure of what\u2019s their signature dish. But here at Kam Long, you know they are selling curry fish head and yet has faithful patrons willing to wait under the hot sun for the food, it has got to be good.\nThe servings came in individual (RM 18), small (RM 22), medium (RM 33) or large (RM 44). The service is pretty efficient as the fish head curry was served in less than 10 minutes, in a claypot. Once order is made, the boss will place the fish head into the claypot, pour their signature curry and cook it over fire. What appeared on our table is a pot of pipping hot curry fish head.\nOur group of 7 ordered a huge claypot of curry fish head to share. Taking a sip of the curry, I knew that one claypot is definitely not enough for all the hungry foodies. The tender flesh of the ang ko li (red snapper) came off the fork easily. The flesh is so soft, absorbing the curry flavours really well. The spices from the curry enhance the natural flavour of the head without overpowering it. Together with tofu skin, ladies finger, long beans and cabbage, it\u2019s a complete meal on its own.\nKam Long Curry Fish Head\nAddress: 74, Jalan Wong Ah Fook, Bandar Johor Bahru, 80000 Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia\nTel: +6016-752-8382, +6016-796-2228. +6016-205-1610\nOpening hours: Monday to Sunday 8am to 4:30pm\nLet\u2019s build a food community that helps to update the food news online!

            "22 Hipster Cafes in Singapore you must visit\nCafes have been popping up all over Singapore in recent times and for good reason too. Want good coffee? Or a quiet place to catch up with friends? Or somewhere with good food and a nice ambience? Want it all? Cafes, and in particular, hipster cafes, have got it all. If you\u2019re someone that takes your coffee and food very seriously, LocoMole is about to introduce 22 hipster cafes in Singapore that will blow you away (or straight to the cafes).\nNorth\nWheeler\u2019s Estate\nMost of you probably know this cafe\u2019s sister \u2013 Wheeler\u2019s Yard (remember those iconic insta-worthy blue gates and brick walls?) I now introduce to you \u2013 Wheeler\u2019s Estate! Set on two acres of lush greenery, this cafe is not simply a cafe. It consists of a restaurant, cafe, bar and even an outside events space. Perfect for that weekend catch-up over piping hot coffee and scrumptious scrambled eggs on toast.\nAddress: 2 Park Lane, Seletar Aerospace Park, Singapore 798386.\nHatched\nDo you love eggs as much as I do? If the answer\u2019s yes, then you absolutely have to visit Hatched at Holland Village. With a menu full of eggs, you won\u2019t be surprised when you find out how egg-cellent (haha) the food is. You\u2019ll be able to choose from a simple eggs-on-toast option or fulfil your adventurous side by customising your own meal. And with its quirky decor and beautiful hanging pot plants, this place will be a hit on your Instagram as well.\nAddress: 267 Holland Avenue, Singapore 278989.\nLola\u2019s Cafe\nLast time I was here, I expected a 10-15 minute wait as you would expect at most cafes. However, my friend and I ended up waiting 20 minutes for a table! That\u2019s how popular this cafe is, even on a weekday. And popular for good reason too. Hidden amongst a row of shophouses, this cafe is truly a gem in the wall. With a typical brunch menu, their addition of craft beers to the menu is what makes them stand out even more. Perfect for having a simple brunch meal with a friend over a couple beers, Lola\u2019s is the place to go!\nAddress: 5 Simon Road, Singapore 545893.\nLittle Part 1\nI think \u201chidden among a row of shophouses\u201d can be a sign that the cafe is going to blow your mind away, because that\u2019s what Little Part 1 has done. Unassumingly tucked away in shophouses located behind Thomson Plaza, this little cafe has the most amazing chicken drumlets/wings you have ever tasted. Forget East Coast Park barbecue chicken wings, Little Part 1 is where it\u2019s truly at. Open till late most days, they not only do a fantastic dinner menu, their house beers and cider are pretty good too! They even provide playing cards and games that are free to borrow, so be prepared to spend a few hours here.\nAddress: 15 Jasmine Road, Singapore 576584.\nIce Cream Chefs\nWho doesn\u2019t love ice-cream? Welcome to Ice Cream Chefs, home to ice-cream flavours like Milo Peng, Cha Yen, Sour Soppy, Earl Grey Tea Latte and With Love, Rose. These flavours are making me drool. With all 100% home-made ice-cream and waffles, this place is truly a gem. Your kids will also definitely love choosing mix-ins for their ice-cream and watching how they are mixed-in through the glass panel! They also do ice-cream cakes which are customisable, so remember to check them out when you\u2019re in need of a cake! A bonus is their super friendly lady boss, who is an absolute treat to chat with whenever she\u2019s in store!\nAddress: 12 Jalan Kuras, Singapore 577727.\nChye Seng Huat Hardware\nWith a 4.3 star rating out of 5 on Google, forget about Starbucks and Coffee Bean! Head down to Chye Seng Huat Hardware for your next coffee fix instead. CSHH means \u201cto flourish again\u201d and the name pays tribute to the hardware heritage of the site and vicinity. They aim to not just serve great coffee, but also educate customers on coffee making! With a 360 degree bar, you\u2019ll get a great view of how your coffee is made by the baristas. They also have a C-Platform on the second floor which is equipped with state-of-the-art coffee machines and gadgets that will allow you to be immersed in all things coffee.\nAddress: 150 Tyrwhitt Road, Singapore 207563.\nWildseed Caf\u00e9 & Bar\nLocated at the Seletar Aerospace Park, this cozy little cafe has retained its colonial architecture and the surrounding gardens, making for the most picturesque view while enjoying your meal. Wildseed has a typical brunch menu but is open until 7pm from Tuesday to Sunday and transforms into the new hipster bar that everyone is talking about. If you have kids, bring them along for dinner and then send them off to the near-by playground while you enjoy a well-deserved cocktail or beer.\nAddress: 3 Park Lane, Singapore 798387.\nSouth\nOld Habits\nWalking past Old Habits, you would never think that it was a cafe. Stocked to the brim with old-school antiques and vintage furniture, it looks more like an antiques shop. But step inside and be surprised by food items such as Coconut Kueh with French Vanilla ice-cream and Popcorn Matcha Latte. They also have vinyl records which can be played on request! Take a trip back to old school Singapore and have the best afternoon of your life reminiscing about the \u201cgood ol\u2019 days\u201d.\nAddress: 38 Telok Blangah Rise, Singapore 090038.\nEast\nFatCat Ice Cream Bar\nI found out about this place after one of my close friend\u2019s brother started working here. And what an absolute gem FatCat is! They offer ice creams and waffles as well as coffee and beers at affordable prices. Think a glass of wine at only $5, what a steal. You\u2019ll also expect super fresh desserts as their plated desserts change daily and are limited because they are made with the freshest ingredients that they are able to get their hands (or paws) on for that day. I\u2019m sure their cafe name is unintentional, but every time I leave, I imagine that my joy is similar to the joy of a Fat Cat.\nAddress: Block 416 Bedok North Avenue 2, #01-25, Singapore 460416.\nD\u2019Zerts Cafe\nThis kitschy little cafe is run by a father-son duo, with Naval Chef Chef Lemuel helming the kitchen area. Aside from desserts, you can expect to find pastas, soups, waffles and even finger food here! I am always. always craving a good chocolate or lemon meringue tart, and I\u2019ve finally found a place that does both! They also have a 4.6 out of 5 star rating, so this is definitely on my to-visit list (and it should be on yours too!)\nAddress: 30 Jalan Pari Burong, Singapore 488696.\nCraftsman Speciality Coffee\nI think most of us here are familiar with Craftsman Speciality, or we\u2019ve been well acquainted with this cafe through Instagram. And for good reason too as this cafe does amazing coffee! If you love coffee, you need to check out cafe. They serve classic lattes and mochas, but also do more fancy coffees such as cold brews and V-60. They also stock coffee gadgets, beans and accessories, so come down for a cuppa and leave with your own equipment to make your next cuppa!\nAddress: 2 First Street, #01-01 Siglap V, Singapore 458278.\nPaddy Hills\n\u201cAre we in Australia or Singapore?\u201d was the first thing that came to mind when a friend told me about this place. Paddy Hills is an Aussie-inspired cafe which does a cafe menu in the day and transforms into a tapas bar in the night. Located in the city but still sufficiently hidden away that you can enjoy a quick meal here, Paddy Hills serves up a mean coffee with their speciality coffee beans that you must try the next time you are here!\nAddress: 38 South Buona Vista Road, Singapore 118164.\nTiong Bahru Bakery\nI think we all already know Tiong Bahru Bakery and their scrumptiously delicious croissants. Flaky, buttery, baked to golden brown perfection, I can go on all day about them. If you haven\u2019t tried them, then you definitely have to! Aside from their perfect 10/10 croissants, you also have to try their amann\u2019s, which will forever have my heart. A quick tip if you are looking for a hearty meal before you sink your teeth into their delectable croissants, visit their Raffles City branch for pastas and burgers which are also pretty good!\nAddress: 56 Eng Hoon Street, #01-70, Singapore 160056.\nWhisk & Paddle\nBe prepared for food served to you in true hipster style at this cafe. Order a serving of Mac\u2019 and Cheese or Eggs Benedict and watch as it is served to you in a mini frying pan! With an outdoor seating area that overlooks the river and its surroundings, Whisk & Paddle is perfect for date night or a family dinner with loved ones. They serve typical cafe items but be pleasantly surprised when you order Eggs Benedict and it comes served with waffles instead of bread!\nAddress: 10 Tebing Lane, #01-10, Singapore 828836.\nWest\nW39\nOpen until 10pm daily except Mondays, W39 serves up European styled dishes and throws in local Singaporean and Asian ingredients that make the dishes truly special. Think Sake mussels with fries, Assam Fish with Rice and Nasi Lemak with Roasted Chicken Thigh. I am salivating. They also serve cakes and breads and have plenty of vegetarian options for those who prefer not to eat meat! Although a little far away (I am truly a North-Sider), this cafe seems well-worth the travel down!\nAddress: 39 Jalan Mas Puteh, Singapore 128367.\nRiders Cafe\nRiders Cafe has been around since 2007 and is well-loved by the early era of hipsters. Located within the Saddle Club in Bukit Timah, you\u2019ll be surrounded by lush greenery and horses, truly the best combination one can ever think of. Although it is quite difficult to get here without a car, I can assure you that Riders Cafe is well worth the trouble!\nAddress: Bukit Timah Saddle Club, 51 Fairways Drive, Singapore 286965.\nCentral\nWild Honey\nEver since I started dating a vegetarian, any eatery that does vegetarian dishes has become a must-visit for me. So when I found out that Wild Honey has 7 vegetarian dishes, it became an immediate to-do. When I googled online, they name their dishes after places such as\u00a0 Spanish, Parisienne, Norwegian and Flinders Lane. I was so intrigued and after reading the short blurb of each dish, I knew I was going to love this place. Aside from mind-blowing mains, they also serve afternoon tea and desserts! A must-visit if you\u2019re looking for your mind to be absolutely blown-away.\nAddress: Scotts Square and Mandarin Gallery.\nP.S Cafe\nWith 8 locations scattered across Singapore, you are never really too far from a P.S Cafe. They have such stunning architecture at all 8 locations that will ensure that your next Instagram post will be a hit! While I\u2019ve personally never been to any of their locations, the long lines outside their Orchard branch is a clear indication that its popular and serves food that keeps the hordes coming back! With its high ceilings and beautiful decor, P.S Cafe is the perfect place to spend hours at while devouring a good book and a slice of cake.\nAddress: 390 Orchard Road, #02-09A, Singapore 238871.\nThe Assembly Ground\nDid you know that clothing store Benjamin Barker is the mega mind behind The Assembly Ground? I never knew until my mum got a voucher for this cafe last weekend! They serve amazing fusion food and are open for both brunch and dinner. With dishes like Rendang Mac & Cheese, Hae Bee Hiam Aglio Olio and Laksa Pasta Mai Hum, the wide array of fusion dishes that they have make this the perfect place to bring your grandparents to for a meal. Who says hipster cafes only serve hipster food that the older generation will never appreciate!\nAddress: 2 Handy Road, #01-21, Singapore 229233.\nThe Providore\nThe Providore \u2013 a cafe, deli, bakery, grocer and cooking studio all in one. It\u2019s literally your one-stop pit stop for everything you could possible need! They have 4 different locations scattered across the CBD and Orchard, but my favourite has to be Mandarin Gallery one with its super open concept. My favourite thing to order from them? Their afternoon high tea set! The high tea menu is a great way to try a few of their little bites and still feel full. I also highly recommend their Lobster Mac & Cheese which was extremely yummy.\nAddress: 7 Raffles Place, Singapore 048625.\nFive by Five\nFive by Five is a cafe and bar that is open until midnight daily! With its white-tiled counters, black bar stools and low hanging white lights, this is a minimalist\u2019s dream cafe. They serve amazing drink concoctions such as their Matcha Latte which has been very well received as well as draft beers. They also do savoury mains such as Chicken Bleu, Japanese Beef Stew and Mac & Cheese aside from the typical brunch meals.\nAddress: 9 Sin Ming Road #01-03, Thomson V One, Singapore 575630.\nBoufe\nLast but not definitely not least, is boutique and cafe \u2013 Boufe! I think everyone knows them for their Instagrammable dessert \u2013 the Unicorn Cake and the Milky Way bar! Aside from the Sweets, they have a pretty impressive dinner menu that is well worth checking out. With mains like Ba Chor Hey Pasta, Tomato Crab Pasta and Boufe Breakfast Don, this cafe clearly does fusion food very well! You\u2019ll also be pleased to know that their more brunch menu items are served all day from 10am-7pm, so it\u2019s never too late for breakfast!\nAddress: Phoenix Park, 308 Tanglin Road, #01-01, Singapore 247974.\nWhether you\u2019re on the hunt for a good cuppa before work or looking for a quaint, quiet place to relax after work, you\u2019ll definitely be able to find somewhere with these 25 cafes scattered all across Singapore!

            "Xing Fu Tang\nChicha San Chen\n1 month ago\nFrom creamy brown sugar concoctions to healthy-ish options\nTo say that there are plenty of bubble tea shops in Singapore is an understatement; it almost seems as if every other day, a brand new stall offering tea beverages surfaces. Here to acquit you of your drink dilemma is this list of\u00a0great bubble tea spots\u00a0worthy of multiple visits, whether you're craving for a decadent brown sugar boba milk or a creamy cheese tea macchiato.\nBest boba options\nBest brown sugar milk concoctions\nCrazy, OTT bubble teas\nFresh milk choices\nUnique tea beverages\nMost refreshing fruit teas\nReally creamy cheese teas\nIn early 2019, Gong Cha made a victorious return to our shores, much to the delight (and relief) of Gong Cha-frequenters. An overwhelming amount of supporters crowded outlets on its re-opening day and until today, the established tea store remains a crowd favourite. The classic Pearl Milk Tea\u00a0is still a bestseller.\nWhile boba and brown sugar syrup receive all the praise in recent years, a key player that often gets overlooked is the tea leaves utilised in the drinks. Taiwanese Chicha San Chen definitely gets this part right with its Cassia Black Tea with Mousse and Green Tea with Honey, which were awarded with the Highest International Authority iTQi certification, which is apparently equivalent to a Michelin three-star accolade.\nLatest News\n18 hours 22 min ago\n3 days 14 hours ago\n"

            "TRAVEL ADVISORY: See updates and precautionary measures on the novel coronavirus in Vietnam here.\n1000-year-old tree in Cuc Phuong National Park. Photo by Christian Berg\nVietnam\u2019s national parks and nature reserves offer tremendous diversity. The north is rich in staggered rice terraces that shift with the seasons. The centre boasts the world\u2019s largest caves and the country\u2019s loudest waterfalls. And the south is home to mangrove forests and exotic wildlife. Here are the top seven Vietnamese national parks and nature reserves you shouldn\u2019t miss.\nBa Be National Park\nBa Be Lake lends its name to this subtropical national park, a vast forest sprinkled with gushing waterfalls and bat caves. The lake\u2019s calm currents are ideal for boat outings, refreshing dips, and fishing trips. On land, spend time exploring the hiking trails that fan out and envelop the lake, or cycling the excellent roads all along the water. Ba Be National Park is partly inhabited by the Tay, one of northern Vietnam\u2019s largest ethnic minority groups. The Tay welcome travellers with authentic homestay experiences in their elevated stilt houses by the lake.\nTips for visiting Ba Be\nBa Be is six hours from Hanoi . You can book organised tours through companies such as Handspan , or arrange your trip independently online. Despite dry and chilly winters, the jungles in Ba Be are lush and beautiful all year round. Occasional storms may disrupt travel plans from July to October.\nPhong Nha-Ke Bang National Park\nPhong Nha-Ke Bang is an adventurer\u2019s wonderland, chock-full of tenacious rivers, vivid jungles, and mammoth caves. This UNESCO-recognised national park is home to some of the world\u2019s largest caves, with many other systems hiding beneath towering, jungle-topped karsts. Depending on your interest, caving experiences can range from afternoon excursions to intense, four-day expeditions. Above these subterranean cave kingdoms, you\u2019ll have opportunities for kayaking, cycling, and hiking in the national park. Restful Phong Nha Town is a beautiful base to return to at the end of each day.\nTips for visiting Phong Nha-Ke Bang\nYou\u2019ll need to base yourself in Phong Nha Town to visit the national park, just a few kilometres away. Your hotel can help your arrange tours to several accessible caves, but for larger caves you\u2019ll need to book in advance with Oxalis or Jungle Boss. March and April are the best months to visit Phong Nha, as the vegetation beams with vitality after the winter rains. Most of the caves are inaccessible in the rainy season, from October to November.\nCuc Phuong National Park\nCuc Phuong is Vietnam\u2019s oldest national park, consecrated by Ho Chi Minh himself. It\u2019s home to a dense forest of millennia-old trees, prehistoric caves, botanical gardens, and two animal sanctuaries which are worth exploring. The Endangered Primate Rescue Centre recovers and rehabilitates illegally captured primate species; while the Turtle Conservation Centre runs rescue, conservation, and breeding programmes. Spend your time trekking, bird-watching, and kayaking; or book a stay in the stilt houses of the hospitable Muong people.\nTips for visiting Cuc Phuong\nOnly two hours from Hanoi and an hour from Ninh Binh , you can easily visit Cuc Phuong within a day or stay in the park longer if you like. Local tour companies in Hanoi offer trips to Cuc Phuong on short notice, and you can find more options on the park\u2019s website. The spring months of April and May bring soaring temperatures but also legions of butterflies \u2014 the sight is worth it if you can brave the heat. Otherwise, there isn\u2019t a bad time to visit Cuc Phuong. Expect winter chills in December and January.\nBach Ma National Park\nRarely-visited Bach Ma is perched halfway between the imperial city of Hue and the ancient town of Hoi An . There\u2019s been little development in the park since the early 20th century, and the area is still home to a small collection of French colonial villas \u2014 now converted into charming guesthouses. There are enough hiking trails to keep you busy for a few days. Some lead through rock pools and waterfalls. On a clear morning, walk to the peak for a spectacular coastal sunrise.\nTips for visiting Bach Ma\nBach Ma National Park is less than two hours\u2019 drive from Hue, Danang, or Hoi An. You can arrange tailored tours from any of these cities, or book in advance with local agencies such as Oriental Sky Travel. The weather in Bach Ma is pleasant from March to September. The mountain\u2019s elevation promises fresh temperatures even when the cities below are simmering. Try to avoid coming in the rainy season, from October to January.\nCat Ba National Park\nA large island in the Gulf of Tonkin, Cat Ba\u2019s compelling landscapes and beaches lure more nature lovers each year. Soak up spellbinding views from the mountaintops, or test your legs on the network of trails that wind through the national park. Some of the more challenging hikes take you over the mountain passes to Viet Hai, an isolated village inaccessible by road. If you\u2019re looking for peace and quiet, Viet Hai has a small selection of basic homestays. Keep an eye out for curious mammals, such as the White-headed Langur, one of the most endangered primates in the world.\nTips for visiting Cat Ba\nForays into Cat Ba National Park, four hours from Hanoi, are easily organised with a local tour companies in Cat Ba or Hanoi. Asia Outdoors offers a range of packages showcasing the national park, from three-hour treks to three-day adventures. September to November are the most comfortable months to visit Cat Ba, despite the risk of storms. May to July is scorching hot, with bright blue skies and deep orange sunsets.\nCat Tien National Park\nA treasure trove of activities awaits in Cat Tien. You could easily spend a week or longer here without getting bored. Cat Then is great option for those who like steamy jungle treks. Multi-day tours will take you deep into the parks to spot endemic wildlife, including bears, crocodiles, bats, snakes, and tropical birds. Don\u2019t miss the chance to take a night safari for encounters with extraordinary insects and colourful reptiles. If you\u2019d rather stay off your feet, you can cycle or motorbike through the park on a network of roads, or take kayaking and boating tours.\nTips for visiting Cat Tien\nCat Tien is about halfway between Ho Chi Minh City and Dalat , and can be reached in three to four hours from either city. Both hubs have tour companies that can tailor tours for you. If you decide to travel independently, be sure to book your accommodation in advance. The best time to visit Cat Tien is during the dry season, from December to July. Heavy rain can engulf the park at other times of the year, churning up the ground and making it difficult to get around.\nPu Luong Nature Reserve\nPu Luong is a microcosm of northern Vietnam, combining the mountains of Sapa, the rice terraces of Mu Cang Chai, and the cultural treasures of Mai Chau. Scenic roads cut across the valley, while sky-high mountain passes serve up panoramic views of the countryside below. Cycling, motorbiking, and driving are all great options to cover large distances in Pu Luong. Long hikes will take you to remote mountain hamlets and ethnic villages. When you want to cool down, you\u2019ll find countless waterfalls and rock pools dotted around the reserve. The villages of Ban Hieu, Ban Don, and Kho Muong are particular highlights \u2013 make your base in any one of them.\nTips for visiting Pu Luong\nPu Luong is an hour from Mai Chau , and four to six hours from Hanoi depending on the season. There are plenty of tour operators in Hanoi and Mai Chau that can tailor tours for you; or you can book hotels and transport on your own and arrange activities once you arrive. Lingering storms touch Pu Luong from July to October, and cold spells from the north are common from December to February. The best time to visit is early October, when the rice terraces turn a golden yellow just before the harvest.\nread more\nSign up for our newsletter\nReceive new travel stories from Vietnam once a month in your inbox.\nSign Up\nUSEFUL LINKS\nWelcome to the official website of Vietnam National Administration of Tourism.

I'd recommend resetting the index after that operation (df = df.reset_index(drop=True)) \u2013 the_new_james Jul 17 '19 at 14:53\nYou should never compare to None with the == operator to start. stackoverflow.com/questions/3257919/\u2026 \u2013 Bram Vanroy Apr 13 at 8:25\nThe best way to do this is with boolean masking:\nIn [56]: df\nOut[56]:\n     line_date  daysago  line_race  rating    raw  wrating\n0   2007-03-31       62         11      56  1.000   56.000\n1   2007-03-10       83         11      67  1.000   67.000\n2   2007-02-10      111          9      66  1.000   66.000\n3   2007-01-13      139         10      83  0.881   73.096\n4   2006-12-23      160         10      88  0.793   69.787\n5   2006-11-09      204          9      52  0.637   33.106\n6   2006-10-22      222          8      66  0.582   38.408\n7   2006-09-29      245          9      70  0.519   36.318\n8   2006-09-16      258         11      68  0.486   33.063\n9   2006-08-30      275          8      72  0.447   32.160\n10  2006-02-11      475          5      65  0.165   10.698\n11  2006-01-13      504          0      70  0.142    9.969\n12  2006-01-02      515          0      64  0.135    8.627\n13  2005-12-06      542          0      70  0.118    8.246\n14  2005-11-29      549          0      70  0.114    7.963\n15  2005-11-22      556          0      -1  0.110   -0.110\n16  2005-11-01      577          0      -1  0.099   -0.099\n17  2005-10-20      589          0      -1  0.093   -0.093\n18  2005-09-27      612          0      -1  0.083   -0.083\n19  2005-09-07      632          0      -1  0.075   -0.075\n20  2005-06-12      719          0      69  0.049    3.360\n21  2005-05-29      733          0      -1  0.045   -0.045\n22  2005-05-02      760          0      -1  0.040   -0.040\n23  2005-04-02      790          0      -1  0.034   -0.034\n24  2005-03-13      810          0      -1  0.031   -0.031\n25  2004-11-09      934          0      -1  0.017   -0.017\n\nIn [57]: df[df.line_race != 0]\nOut[57]:\n     line_date  daysago  line_race  rating    raw  wrating\n0   2007-03-31       62         11      56  1.000   56.000\n1   2007-03-10       83         11      67  1.000   67.000\n2   2007-02-10      111          9      66  1.000   66.000\n3   2007-01-13      139         10      83  0.881   73.096\n4   2006-12-23      160         10      88  0.793   69.787\n5   2006-11-09      204          9      52  0.637   33.106\n6   2006-10-22      222          8      66  0.582   38.408\n7   2006-09-29      245          9      70  0.519   36.318\n8   2006-09-16      258         11      68  0.486   33.063\n9   2006-08-30      275          8      72  0.447   32.160\n10  2006-02-11      475          5      65  0.165   10.698\nUPDATE: Now that pandas 0.13 is out, another way to do this is df.query('line_race != 0').\ndf.query looks very useful!

Highly recommend.\n49155 silver badges1717 bronze badges\nEspecially helpful if you have long DataFrame variable names like me (and, I'd venture to guess, everyone as compared to the df used for examples), because you only have to write it once. \u2013 ijoseph Apr 26 '18 at 17:52\n13\nIf you want to delete rows based on multiple values of the column, you could use:\ndf[(df.line_race != 0) & (df.line_race != 10)]\nTo drop all rows with values 0 and 10 for line_race.\n9\nThough the previou answer are almost similar to what I am going to do, but using the index method does not require using another indexing method .loc(). It can be done in a similar but precise manner as\ndf.drop(df.index[df['line_race'] == 0], inplace = True)\n1\nIn place solution better for large datasets or memory constrained. +1 \u2013 davmor Oct 24 '19 at 11:45\n3\nAnother way of doing it. May not be the most efficient way as the code looks a bit more complex than the code mentioned in other answers, but still alternate way of doing the same thing.\ndf = df.drop(df[df['line_race']==0].index)\nJust adding another way for DataFrame expanded over all columns:\nfor column in df.columns:\n   df = df[df[column]!=0]\nExample:\ndef z_score(data,count):\n   threshold=3\n   for column in data.columns:\n       mean = np.mean(data[column])\n       std = np.std(data[column])\n       for i in data[column]:\n           zscore = (i-mean)/std\n           if(np.abs(zscore)>threshold):\n               count=count+1\n               data = data[data[column]!=i]\n   return data,count\nanswered Feb 5 at 23:44\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!\nPlease be sure to answer the question.

You can write a classmethod to automatically convert to the other:\nclass geoLocation:\n    def __init__(self, lat, long):\n        \"\"\"init class from lat,long as radians\"\"\"\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fromDegrees(cls, dlat, dlong):\n        \"\"\"creat `cls` from lat,long in degrees \"\"\"\n        return cls( to_radians(dlat), to_radians(dlong))\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fromRadians(cls, lat, long): # just in case\n        return cls(lat, long)\n\nobj = geoLocation.fromDegrees(10,20) # returns a new geoLocation object\n5\nI would just include a boolean in your init method. Instead of having two __init__ methods, do the following:\nclass geoLocation:\n    def __init__(self, lat, long, degrees=True):\n        if degrees:\n            # process as fromDegrees\n            (self._radLat, self._radLong, self._degLat, self._degLong) = self.fromDegrees(lat, long)\n        else:\n            (self._radLat, self._radLong, self._degLat, self._degLong) = self.fromRadians(lat, long)\n\n    def fromDegrees(self, lat, long):\n        # some function returning radLat and long and degLat and long in a tuple\n    def fromRadians(self, lat, long):\n        # same idea but different calculations\nclass geoLocation(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def fromDegrees(cls, lat, long):\n        return cls(lat, long, True)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fromRadians(cls, lat, long):\n        return cls(lat, long, False)\n\n    def __init__(self, lat, long, degrees=True):\n        if degrees:\n            #blah\n        else:\n            #blah\nanswered Jun 28 '10 at 18:26\nAnother option is to have to subclasses of GeoLocation, say DegreesGeoLocation and RadiansGeoLocation. Now you can give each their own init function.\nYou are now storing the location twice in your class, once using radians and once using degrees. This can cause problems if you accidentally modify one representation but forget the other. I think you could best use one representation, and provide getters and setters which eventually do the conversion to the other representation.\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!\nPlease be sure to answer the question.

            "Dismiss\nChange your preferences any time.\nQ&A for Work\nStack Overflow for Teams is a private, secure spot for you and\r\n                            your coworkers to find and share information.\nI'm having a problem with np.append.\nI'm trying to duplicate the last column of 20x361 matrix n_list_converted by using the code below:\nn_last = []\nn_last = n_list_converted[:, -1]\nn_lists = np.append(n_list_converted, n_last, axis=1)\nBut I get error:\nValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions\nHowever, I've checked the matrix dimensions by doing\nprint(n_last.shape, type(n_last), n_list_converted.shape, type(n_list_converted))\nand I get\n(20L,)  (20L, 361L)\n13\n6\nIt worked! But why? \u2013 odo22 Aug 9 '16 at 10:59\n15\nIf I start with a 3x4 array, and concatenate a 3x1 array, with axis 1, I get a 3x5 array:\nIn [911]: x = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)\nIn [912]: np.concatenate([x,x[:,-1:]], axis=1)\nOut[912]: \narray([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  3],\n       [ 4,  5,  6,  7,  7],\n       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 11]])\nIn [913]: x.shape,x[:,-1:].shape\nOut[913]: ((3, 4), (3, 1))\nNote that both inputs to concatenate have 2 dimensions.\nOmit the :, and x[:,-1] is (3,) shape - it is 1d, and hence the error:\nIn [914]: np.concatenate([x,x[:,-1]], axis=1)\n...\nValueError: all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions\nThe code for np.append is (in this case where axis is specified)\nreturn concatenate((arr, values), axis=axis)\nSo with a slight change of syntax append works.  Instead of a list it takes 2 arguments.  It imitates the list append is syntax, but should not be confused with that list method.\nIn [916]: np.append(x, x[:,-1:], axis=1)\nOut[916]: \narray([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  3],\n       [ 4,  5,  6,  7,  7],\n       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 11]])\nnp.hstack first makes sure all inputs are atleast_1d, and then does concatenate:\nreturn np.concatenate([np.atleast_1d(a) for a in arrs], 1)\nSo it requires the same x[:,-1:] input.  Essentially the same action.\nnp.column_stack also does a concatenate on axis 1.  But first it passes 1d inputs through\narray(arr, copy=False, subok=True, ndmin=2).T\nThis is a general way of turning that (3,) array into a (3,1) array.\nIn [922]: np.array(x[:,-1], copy=False, subok=True, ndmin=2).T\nOut[922]: \narray([[ 3],\n       [ 7],\n       [11]])\nIn [923]: np.column_stack([x,x[:,-1]])\nOut[923]: \narray([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  3],\n       [ 4,  5,  6,  7,  7],\n       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 11]])\nAll these 'stacks' can be convenient, but in the long run, it's important to understand dimensions and the base np.concatenate.  Also know how to look up the code for functions like this.  I use the ipython ?? magic a lot.\nAnd in time tests, the np.concatenate is noticeably faster - with a small array like this the extra layers of function calls makes a big time difference.\n12\n(n,) and (n,1) are not the same shape. Try casting the vector to an array by using the [:, None] notation:\nn_lists = np.append(n_list_converted, n_last[:, None], axis=1)\nAlternatively, when extracting n_last you can use\nn_last = n_list_converted[:, -1:]\n6\nThe reason why you get your error is because a \"1 by n\" matrix is different from an array of length n.\nI recommend using hstack() and vstack() instead.\nLike this:\nimport numpy as np\na = np.arange(32).reshape(4,8) # 4 rows 8 columns matrix.\nb = a[:,-1:]                    # last column of that matrix.\n\nresult = np.hstack((a,b))       # stack them horizontally like this:\n#array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  7],\n#       [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15],\n#       [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 23],\n#       [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31]])\nNotice the repeated \"7, 15, 23, 31\" column.\nAlso, notice that I used a[:,-1:] instead of a[:,-1]. My version generates a column:\narray([[7],\n       [15],\n       [23],\n       [31]])\nInstead of a row array([7,15,23,31])\nEdit: append() is much slower. Read this answer .\n27111 silver badge1010 bronze badges\nnp.append is slower than list .append; but comparable to the stacks.  It uses np.concatenate. \u2013 hpaulj Aug 9 '16 at 12:59\n@hpaulj So... As I was saying using append vs stack is the same with 2 matrices and stack is better for more than 2 elements, so stack is always at least as good as append. \u2013 RuRo Aug 9 '16 at 15:15\nYou can also cast (n,) to (n,1) by enclosing within brackets [ ].\ne.g. Instead of np.append(b,a,axis=0) use np.append(b,[a],axis=0)\na=[1,2]\nb=[[5,6],[7,8]]\nnp.append(b,[a],axis=0)\nreturns\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!\nPlease be sure to answer the question.

SportSG\u2019s Advisory on Sport and Physical Exercise & Activities For The Control Period of 7 April 2020 to 4 May 2020 (Updated Measures) has additional measures for your health and wellbeing. Refer to our latest advisory for more details.\nBy Hevina Kaur\nWhether you\u2019re an adrenaline junkie or you\u2019re looking to get out of your comfort zone, wakeboarding is a thrilling and unique sport to try your hand at. Here are 3 of the best places to Wakeboard or Waterski in Singapore.\n1. RYDERS SINGAPORE\nRyders Singapore is the largest watersports company in Singapore. Dedicated to providing customers an unparalleled experience on the waters, the folks at Ryders have a core belief that wakeboarding is more than just a sport, it\u2019s a lifestyle.\u00a0 Besides private bookings, they also conduct their monthly event, Wake & Bake, where like-minded watersports enthusiasts gather to wakeboard and dine together.\nPrice:\nRates begin from $120/hour, with personalised coaching, all required equipment included and a whole lot of fun guaranteed!\nAddress:\nContact:\n91895957\n2. Edge Wakeboarding\nEdge calls themselves a place for Wakeboarders by Wakeboarders. Now, that probably sounds a little bit intimidating but they promise to cater to people of every skill level just as long as you have an interest in Wakeboarding. They also provide equipment and instructors who have an average of 10 years experience.\nThey use a less conservative method of teaching, relying on the \u201cfeel\u201d of the sport rather than the technicalities. They ensure that this method allows students to learn in a much faster and safer manner.\nPrice:\n3. Singapore Wake Park\nSki 360 is the first Cable-Ski Park in Singapore with a new 650 m Cableway. They provide lessons in cable wakeboarding, unique only to this school. I live pretty near this school and happen to pass by it a lot on my runs at East Coast. It looks really interesting and it's motorised cables have introduced a fresh concept new to Singapore.\nThis automation maybe the reason why its relatively much cheaper than the other wakeboarding service providers, but then again, this does not cater to students like the rest.\nPrice:\n$38 per hour on Weekdays and $50 for one hours on Weekends\nAddress:\n6442 7318\n4. WAKEMUSTERS\nGone are the days of paddling out from the beach to catch those waves. You can now surf behind the boat without all that effort. Wakemusters is only company in Singapore that specializes in wakesurfing.\u00a0 From helping absolute beginners get up on the board for the first time, to teaching cool new tricks to more advanced wakesurfers, you can expect helpful, personalized tips from their coach, who\u2019s certified under the National Registry of Coaches. With a boat equipped with premium equipment and specially set-up for creating big waves, get yourselves ready for the most enjoyable wakesurfing experience! Bring some friends too, as there is comfortable space for up to 6 people onboard. Afterall, it is #TheCompanyThatMatters\nPrice:\nRates range from $150 for Wakesurfing to $170 for Wakeboarding\nADDRESS: MARINA COUNTRY CLUB, 11 NORTHSHORE DRIVE, SINGAPORE 828670\nCONTACT: 90487060\nTo receive the latest updates on the happenings in the Singapore sports scene, or to find out more about some of the latest programmes on offer at ActiveSG, like our Facebook page here .\nContact\n"

            "Outdoor activities for couples in Singapore\nThe best part of being in a relationship is probably the fact that you now have a default +1 to bring on all your dates and food escapades. But more than just a growing love for each other, all this feasting can also lead to an expanding waistline \u2013 for the both of you.\nIf you and bae are looking for new date ideas to burn those calories, don\u2019t just settle for your usual run or odd badminton session. From dancing under the stars to acroyoga, here\u2019s a list of 8 outdoor activities that promise fun\u00a0and a ripped body while you\u2019re at\u00a0it.\nLook out for our pro tips to enjoy these workouts, fuss-free.\n1. Tree Climbing \u2013 build your core muscles by scaling trees like Tarzan and Jane\nWho would\u2019ve thought that climbing trees could become a sport in its own right? Human Naturally has classes that incorporate natural environments, and that includes tree climbing. Their Climb Like A Monkey exercise will have you using your core muscles and stamina to scale high branches and beams.\nTheir workouts are also centred around posture and movement skills, like their Born To Run workout that teaches you how to run barefoot with zero injuries.\nClasses are kept to a cosy size of just 8 participants, and if you bring your partner along, you only have to pay $25/pax instead of the usual $30/pax. View their upcoming sessions and book your slot in advance here .\nPro tip: If you don\u2019t quite have 20/20 vision, you\u2019ll want to wear contact lenses to gauge accurate distances between tree branches.\nRates:\n$30/pax\nTelephone: 9632 8448\nEssentially yoga with airborne poses, acroyoga is a fun practice which combines yoga, acrobatics and even Thai massage. Overall, these sessions will help to trust between you and your partner since you\u2019ll be attempting contortionist-worthy poses that require teamwork to pull off.\nThe classes are beginner-friendly and conducted at different times by various instructors all over Singapore, so you can choose sessions that best suit your schedule. For further details on each class, you can check out the acroyoga Facebook page .\nSign up for a free ClassPass and you\u2019ll be able to go for these sessions free-of-charge for an entire week. View the full list of lessons here .\nPro tip: Wear comfortable clothing that doesn\u2019t restrict your movement to nail those stretches.\nRates: from $99/month on ClassPass\n3. Paddle boating \u2013 Build your leg muscles while cruising around Jurong Lake or Marina Bay\nLeg day doesn\u2019t always entail spending an hour doing leg presses or lunges. You\u2019ll get just as solid a leg workout with an hour-long pedal boat ride over at PAssion WaVe at Jurong Lake Gardens and Marina Bay.\nThe boat is shaped like a little sampan, except with a paddling mechanism that\u2019s installed in the middle. There\u2019s also a canopy for shade so you won\u2019t have to worry about getting burnt.\nOther activities like kayaking are available too\nAt $10 nett, you\u2019ll get to sit back, enjoy the tranquil views of the city skyline or the open landscape of Jurong Lake gardens while shedding a few calories at the same time.\nPro tip: Bring along a bottle of water and stay hydrated while you\u2019re paddling on the lake.\nRates:\n$9/hour at PAssion WaVe @ Jurong Lake Gardens\nMarina Bay:\nTelephone: 6296 6683\nYou may have caught bae\u2019s heart, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should stop fishing for opportunities to be closer. Try Fever\u2019s kayak fishing tour where you and your partner can try your hand at fishing from a kayak. You can opt for two individual kayaks, but if the both of you are an inseparable pair, you\u2019ll also be able to get cosy in a single kayak.\nThe tours vary in location and distance. The Playground is great for first-timers who are new to paddle boating and fishing, as it covers an achievable distance of 2- 4km. You may even spot (and catch) different species of fish like groupers, snappers and flatheads!\nFor couples who wish to dive into the deep end of being adventurous, check out the Island Hopper option.

            "15 June 2018\nPunggol is one of our favourite cycling spots and, with the Park Connector Network in place, an easy location to have a mini-adventure on two wheels. That is exactly what we did one late afternoon as we took a Punggol cycling route past varied landscapes and places in the northeast of Singapore.\nPunggol Cycling Route: From The Waterway\nThe starting point was at SAFRA Punggol where we rented bikes for our little expedition. We set off eastwards towards along the Punggol Waterway, heading in the direction of Lorong Halus.\nA while later, we arrived at the Lorong Halus Bridge. The rust-coloured bridge connects Punggol and Pasir Ris across Sungei Serangoon.\nAfter pushing our bikes across the bridge, we arrived at the Lorong Halus Wetland. Its reed-covered environment acts as a unique water treatment process and protects the waters of the Serangoon River from being polluted.\nDirt\u00a0Tracks\nWe traded the paved path for a dirt track that ran northwards. This led towards a dam and Coney Island.\nIt was back to a short stretch of road as we cycled along the dam to reach Coney Island.\nInside Coney Island Park , a gravelly dirt track stretches out along the length of the island. The island\u2019s natural ruggedness is one of the most enjoyable parts of this Punggol cycling route.\nAt the other end of Coney Island Park, we said goodbye to the island\u2019s casuarina trees and ventured onto the Punggol Promenade.\nCoastal Cycling\nHeading northwards, we cycled past Punggol Settlement , Punggol Jetty and Punggol beach.\nWe were accompanied by the sea breeze as we cycled on, eventually reaching Punggol Marina Country Club.\nHere, we had to navigate our way across Punggol Way, using the traffic lights and pedestrian crossing, before continuing along the park connector.\nVery soon, we arrived back at Punggol Waterway\u2019s Jewel Bridge. This was at the other end of the waterway from the Lorong Halus bridge. It had only been an hour.\nOn to Sengkang\nNot keen to end our adventure quite so soon, we carried on along the park connector rather than taking the route along Punggol Waterway. This cycling route follows Sungei Punggol and took us down to Sengkang Riverside Park on the other side of the Tampines Expressway.\nA natural pitstop at Sengkang Riverside Park was\u00a0the Sengkang Community Club where the Sengkang Swimming Complex is also located.\nAfter a quick refreshment, it was simply a matter of retracing our route back to Punggol and cycling along the Punggol Waterway from Jewel Bridge towards SAFRA Punggol.\nBack to Punggol\nThe last stretch of this Punggol cycling route led us past Waterway Point and Punggol Waterway Park and its huge sandpit before we arrived back at SAFRA Punggol.\nThis Punggol cycling route provides a variety of things to see along the way. It provides an opportunity to experience cycling on various terrain and It is generally well-marked out (however, you will need to take some precautions not to get lost and while crossing the road at the Punggol Marina).\nOverall, it makes for a fun, little cycling adventure that doesn\u2019t stray too far away from urbanity.\nThe approximate distance of this Punggol cycling route is 15 km.\n16 April 2020\nIn this new season of circuit breaker (CB) and full home-based learning (HBL), many adjustments have to be made by parents.

            "The history of the modern state of Singapore dates back to its founding in the early nineteenth century, but evidence suggests that a significant trading settlement existed in the Island of Singapore in the 14th century. At the time, the Kingdom of Singapura was under the rule of Parameswara , who killed the previous ruler before he was expelled by the Majapahit or the Siamese. It then came under the Malacca Sultanate and then the Johor Sultanate . In 1819, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles negotiated a treaty whereby Johor allowed the British to locate a trading port on the island, leading to the establishment of the British crown colony of Singapore in 1819.\nDuring World War 2 , Singapore was conquered and occupied by the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. When the war ended, Singapore reverted to British control, with increasing levels of self-government being granted, culminating in Singapore's merger with the Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia in 1963. However, social unrest and disputes between Singapore's ruling People's Action Party and Malaysia's Alliance Party resulted in Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia . Singapore became an independent republic on 9 August 1965.\nFacing severe unemployment and a housing crisis, Singapore embarked on a modernization programme beginning in the late 1960s through the 1970s that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing estates and investing heavily on public education and infrastructure.\nBy the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly developed free market economy , strong international trading links. It now has the highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia, [1] which is 7th in the world, and it is ranked 9th on the UN Human Development Index . [2] [3]\nContents\nAn artist's impression of Parameswara , who ruled Singapore in the 1390s.\nThe Greco-Roman astronomer Ptolemy (90\u2013168) identified a place called Sabana at the tip of Golden Chersonese (believed to be the Malay Peninsula ) in the second and third century. [4] The earliest written record of Singapore may be in a Chinese account from the third century, describing the island of Pu Luo Chung ( \u84b2 \u7f85 \u4e2d ). This is thought to be a transcription from the Malay name \" Pulau Ujong \", or \"island at the end\" (of the Malay Peninsula ). [5]\nIn 1025 CE, Rajendra Chola I of the Chola Empire led forces across the Indian Ocean and invaded the Srivijayan empire , attacking several places in Malaysia and Indonesia . [6] [7] The Chola forces were said to have controlled Temasek (now Singapore ) for a couple of decades. [8] The name Temasek however did not appear in Chola records, but a tale involving a Raja Chulan (assumed to be Rajendra Chola) and Temasek was mentioned in the semi-historical Malay Annals . [9]\nThe Nagarakretagama , a Javanese epic poem written in 1365, referred to a settlement on the island called Tumasik (possibly meaning \"Sea Town\" or \"Sea Port\"). [10] The name Temasek is also given in Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals), which contains a tale of the founding of Temasek by a prince of Srivijaya , Sri Tri Buana (also known as Sang Nila Utama ) in the 13th century. Sri Tri Buana landed on Temasek on a hunting trip, and saw a strange beast said to be a lion. The prince took this as an auspicious sign and founded a settlement called Singapura, which means \"Lion City\" in Sanskrit. The actual origin of the name Singapura however is unclear according to scholars. [11]\nThe Mao Kun map from Wubei Zhi which is based on the early 15th century maps of Zheng He showing Temasek (\u6de1\u99ac\u932b) at the top left, and Long Ya Men (\u9f8d\u7259\u9580) on the right panel.\nIn 1320, the Mongol Empire sent a trade mission to a place called Long Ya Men (or Dragon's Teeth Gate), which is believed to be Keppel Harbour at the southern part of the island. [12] The Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan , visiting the island around 1330, described Long Ya Men as one of the two distinct settlements in Dan Ma Xi (from Malay Temasek ), the other being Ban Zu (from Malay pancur). Ban Zu is thought to be present day Fort Canning Hill, and recent excavations in Fort Canning found evidence indicating that Singapore was an important settlement in the 14th century. [13] [14] Wang mentioned that the natives of Long Ya Men (thought to be the Orang Laut ) and Chinese residents lived together in Long Ya Men. [15] [16] Singapore is one of the oldest locations where a Chinese community is known to exist outside China, and the oldest corroborated by archaeological evidence. [17]\nA fragment of the Singapore Stone , inscribed with an Indic script , c. 10th to 13th century.\nBy the 14th century, the empire of Srivijaya had already declined, and Singapore was caught in the struggle between Siam (now Thailand ) and the Java-based Majapahit Empire for control over the Malay Peninsula. According to the Malay Annals , Singapore was defeated in one Majapahit attack. The last king, Sultan Iskandar Shah ruled the island for several years, before being forced to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca . [18] Portuguese sources however indicated that Temasek was a Siamese vassal whose ruler was killed by Parameswara (thought to be the same person as Sultan Iskandar Shah) from Palembang, and Parameswara was then driven to Malacca, either by the Siamese or the Majapahit, where he founded the Malacca Sultanate . [19] Modern archaeological evidence suggests that the settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. [11]\nThe Malacca Sultanate extended its authority over the island and Singapore became a part of the Malacca Sultanate. [5] However, by the time the Portuguese arrived in the early 16th century, Singapura had already become \"great ruins\" according to Alfonso de Albuquerque . [20] [21] In 1511, the Portuguese seized Malacca; the sultan of Malacca escaped south and established the Johor Sultanate , and Singapore then became part of the sultanate. The Portuguese however destroyed the settlement in Singapore in 1613, and the island sank into obscurity for the next two centuries. [22] [23]\nSir Thomas Stamford Raffles.\nBetween the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was gradually taken over by the European colonial powers, beginning with the arrival of the Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch , who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British , were limited to a relatively minor presence. [24]\nIn 1818, Sir Stamford Raffles was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony at Bencoolen . He was determined that Great Britain should replace the Netherlands as the dominant power in the archipelago, since the trade route between China and British India , which had become vitally important with the institution of the opium trade with China, passed through the archipelago. The Dutch had been stifling British trade in the region by prohibiting the British from operating in Dutch-controlled ports or by subjecting them to a high tariff. Raffles hoped to challenge the Dutch by establishing a new port along the Straits of Malacca , the main ship passageway for the India-China trade. He needed a third port since the British only had the ports of Penang and Bencoolen. The port had to be strategically located along the main trade route between India and China and in the middle of the Malay Archipelago. He convinced Lord Hastings , the Governor-General of India and his superior at the British East India Company , to fund an expedition to seek a new British base in the region. [24]\nA statue of Raffles by Thomas Woolner now stands in Singapore, near Raffles's landing site in 1819.\nRaffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port. It lay at the southern tip of the Malay peninsula, near the Straits of Malacca , and possessed a natural deep harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. It was also located along the main trade route between India and China. Raffles found a small Malay settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River , with an estimated population of about 150 that consisted of around 120 Malays and 30 Chinese. [25] headed by the Temenggong and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman. Around 100 of these Malays had originally moved to Singapore from Johor in 1811 led by the Temenggong . [25] The entire island may have a population of 1,000 including the various tribes and Orang Laut (sea gypsies). [26] The island was nominally ruled by the Sultan of Johor , who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis . However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman's elder brother Tengku Long who was living in exile in Riau . With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. He offered to recognize Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, given the title of Sultan Hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore. [24] A formal treaty was signed on 6 February 1819 and modern Singapore was born. [27] [28]\nWhen Raffles arrived, it was estimated that there were around 1,000 people living in the whole of the island of Singapore, mostly local groups that would become assimilated into Malays and a few dozen Chinese. [29] [30] The population increased rapidly soon after Raffles' arrival; the first census of 1824 shows that 6,505 out of the 10,683 total were Malays and Bugis. [31] Large number of Chinese migrants also started to enter Singapore just months after it became a British settlement, by the census of 1826, there were already more Chinese than Malays excluding Bugis and Javanese. [32] Due to continual migration from Malaya , China, India and other parts of Asia, Singapore's population had reached nearly 100,000 by 1871, with over half of them Chinese. [33] Many early Chinese and Indian immigrants came to Singapore to work in various plantations and tin mines and they were predominantly male, and large number of them would return to their home countries after they had earned enough money. However, an increasingly significant number chose to stay permanently by the early to mid twentieth century, and their descendants would form the bulk of Singapore's population. [34] [35]\n1819\u20131942: Colonial Singapore[ edit ]\n1819\u20131826: Early growth[ edit ]\nThe Plan of the Town of Singapore, or more commonly known as the Jackson Plan or Raffles Town Plan.\nRaffles returned to Bencoolen soon after the signing of the treaty and left Major William Farquhar in charge of the new settlement, with some artillery and a small regiment of Indian soldiers. Establishing a trading port from scratch was a daunting endeavor.  Farquhar's administration was fairly funded and was prohibited from collecting port duties to raise revenue as Raffles had decided that Singapore would be a free port . Farquhar invited settlers to Singapore, and stationed a British official on St. John's Island to invite passing ships to stop in Singapore. As news of the free port spread across the archipelago, Bugis , Peranakan Chinese , and Arab traders flocked to the island, seeking to circumvent the Dutch trade restrictions. During the starting year of operation in 1819, $400,000 ( Spanish dollars ) worth of trade passed through Singapore. By 1821, the island's population had gone up to around 5,000, and the trade volume was $8 million. The population reached the 10,000 mark in 1824, [31] and with a trade volume of $22 million, Singapore surpassed the long-established port of Penang . [24]\nRaffles returned to Singapore in 1822 and became critical of many of Farquhar's decisions, despite Farquhar's success in leading the settlement through its difficult early years.  For instance, in order to generate much-needed revenue, Farquhar had resorted to selling licenses for gambling and the sale of opium, which Raffles saw as social evils. Shocked at the disarray of the colony as well as the tolerance of slave trade by Farquhar, Raffles set about drafting a set of new policies for the settlement, such as banning of slavery, closing of gambling dens, prohibition of carrying of weapons, and heavy taxation to discourage what he considered to be social vices such as drunkenness and opium-smoking. [36] He also organized Singapore into functional and ethnic subdivisions under the Raffles Plan of Singapore . [24] Today, remnants of this organization can still be found in the ethnic neighbourhoods . William Farquhar was also stripped off his post. Farquhar later died in Perth , Scotland .\nOn 7 June 1823, John Crawfurd signed a second treaty with the Sultan and Temenggong, which extended British possession to most of the island. The Sultan and Temenggong traded most of their administrative rights of the island, including the collection of port taxes for lifelong monthly payments of $1500 and $800 respectively. This agreement brought the island under the British Law , with the provision that it would take into account Malay customs, traditions and religion. [24] Raffles replaced Farquhar with John Crawfurd, an efficient and frugal administrator, as the new governor. [37] In October 1823, Raffles departed for Britain and would never return to Singapore as he died in 1826, at the age of 44. [38] In 1824, Singapore was ceded in perpetuity to the East India Company by the Sultan.\n1826\u20131867: The Straits Settlements[ edit ]\nRestored shophouses running along a street in Chinatown, which reflects the Victorian architecture of buildings built in Singapore during the earlier colonial period, with styles such as the painted ladies .\nThe status of a British outpost in Singapore seemed initially in doubt as the Dutch government soon protested to Britain for violating the Netherlands' sphere of influence. But as Singapore rapidly emerged as an important trading post, Britain consolidated its claim on the island. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 cemented the status of Singapore as a British possession, carving up the Malay archipelago between the two colonial powers with the area north of the Straits of Malacca, including Singapore, falling under Britain's sphere of influence. In 1826, Singapore was grouped by the British East India Company [39] together with Penang and Malacca to form the Straits Settlements , administered by the British East India Company . In 1830, the Straits Settlements became a residency, or subdivision, of the Presidency of Bengal in British India . [40]\nDuring the subsequent decades, Singapore grew to become an important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including the opening of the Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships , the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, [41] and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. [42] Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta ) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. [43] The main commercial activity was entrep\u00f4t trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen who handled most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants. [40]\nBy 1827, the Chinese had become the largest ethnic group in Singapore. They consisted of Peranakans , who were descendants of early Chinese settlers, and Chinese coolies who flocked to Singapore to escape economic hardship in southern China. Their numbers were swelled by those fleeing the turmoil caused by the First Opium War (1839\u20131842) and Second Opium War (1856\u20131860). Many arrived in Singapore as impoverished indentured laborers . The Malays were the second largest ethnic group until the 1860s and they worked as fishermen, craftsmen, or as wage earners while continued to live mostly in kampungs . By 1860, the Indians had become the second largest ethnic group. They consisted of unskilled labourers, traders, and convicts who were sent to carry out public works projects such as clearing jungles and laying out roads. There were also Indian Sepoy troops garrisoned at Singapore by the British. [40]\nDespite Singapore's growing importance, the administration governing the island was understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with the welfare of the populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. [40] As a result of the administration's ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly of opium) were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads ) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success. [44]\nThe situation created deep concern in the European population of the island. In 1854 the Singapore Free Press complained that Singapore was a \"small island\" full of the \"very dregs of the population of south eastern Asia\". [45]\n1867\u20131942: Straits Settlements Crown Colony[ edit ]\n1888 German map of Singapore\nAs Singapore continued to grow, the deficiencies in the Straits Settlements administration became serious and Singapore's merchant community began agitating against British Indian rule. The British government agreed to establish the Straits Settlements as a separate Crown Colony on 1 April 1867. This new colony was ruled by a governor under the supervision of the Colonial Office in London. An executive council and a legislative council assisted the governor. [46] Although members of the councils were not elected, more representatives for the local population were gradually included over the years.\nBaedeker map of the city and environs, c. 1914\nThe colonial government embarked on several measures to address the serious social problems facing Singapore. A Chinese Protectorate under Pickering was established in 1877 to address the needs of the Chinese community, especially in controlling the worst abuses of the coolie trade and protecting Chinese women from forced prostitution. [46] In 1889 Governor Sir Cecil Clementi Smith banned secret societies, driving them underground. [46] Nevertheless, many social problems persisted up through the post-war era, including an acute housing shortage and poor health and living standards. In 1906, the Tongmenghui , a revolutionary Chinese organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and led by Sun Yat-sen , founded its Nanyang branch in Singapore, which served as the organisation's headquarters in Southeast Asia. [46] The members of the branch included Dr. Wong Hong-Kui (\u9ec3\u5eb7\u8862), [47] Mr. Tan Chor Lam (\u9673\u695a\u6960, 1884\u20131971, originally a rubber manufacturer) [48] and Mr. Teo Eng Hock (\u5f35\u6c38\u798f, originally a rubber shoe manufacturer). [49] Chan Cho-Nam, Cheung Wing-Fook and Chan Po-Yin (\u9673\u6b65\u8ce2, 1883\u20131965) started the revolution-related Chong Shing Chinese Daily Newspaper (\u4e2d\u8208\u65e5\u5831, \u4e2d\u8208 meaning China revival), [50] with the inaugural issue on 20 August 1907 and a daily distribution of 1000 copies. The newspaper ended in 1910, presumably due to the revolution in 1911.  Working with other Cantonese people, Chan, Cheung and Chan opened the revolution-related Kai Ming Bookstore (\u958b\u660e\u66f8\u5831\u793e, \u958b\u660e meaning open wisdom) [51] in Singapore. For the revolution, Chan Po-Yin raised over 30,000 yuan for the purchase and shipment (from Singapore to China) of military equipment and for the support of the expenses of people travelling from Singapore to China for revolutionary work. [52] [53] The immigrant Chinese population in Singapore donated generously to Tongmenghui, which organised the 1911 Xinhai Revolution that led to the establishment of the Republic of China.\nA busy Victoria Dock, Tanjong Pagar, in the 1890s.\nWorld War I (1914\u20131918) did not deeply affect Singapore: the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia. The only significant local military event during the war was a 1915 mutiny by the British Muslim Indian sepoys garrisoned in Singapore. [54] After hearing rumors of plans to send them to fight the Ottoman Empire , the soldiers revolted, killing their officers and several British civilians before troops arriving from Johor and Burma suppressed the unrest. [55]\nAfter the war, the British government devoted significant resources into building a naval base in Singapore, as a deterrent to the increasingly ambitious Japanese Empire . Completed in 1939 at a staggering cost of $500 million, the naval base boasted what was then the largest dry dock in the world, the third-largest floating dock , and enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns and by Royal Air Force squadrons stationed at Tengah Air Base . Winston Churchill touted it as the \" Gibraltar of the East.\" Unfortunately, it was a base without a fleet. The British Home Fleet was stationed in Europe and the plan was for it to sail quickly to Singapore when needed. However, after World War II broke out in 1939, the Fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain . [56] Lieutenant General Sir William George Shedden Dobbie was appointed governor of Singapore and General Officer Commanding Malaya Command on 8 November 1935, holding the post based in The Istana until shortly before the outbreak of World War II in 1939.  He was responsible for forming The Dobbie Hypothesis on the fall of Singapore which, had it been heeded, may have prevented the fall of Singapore during the Second World War .\nDamage caused by a Japanese air assault on 8 February 1942. Many civilians were killed in these air raids.\nIn December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the east coast of Malaya, causing the Pacific War to begin in earnest. Both attacks occurred at the same time, but due to the international dateline, the Honolulu attack is dated 7 December while the Kota Bharu attack is dated 8 December. One of Japan's objectives was to capture Southeast Asia and secure the rich supply of natural resources to feed its military and industry needs. Singapore, the main Allied base in the region, was an obvious military target because of its flourishing trade and wealth.\nThe British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese attack would come by sea from the south, since the dense Malayan jungle in the north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion. Although they had drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya, preparations were never completed. The military was confident that \"Fortress Singapore\" would withstand any Japanese attack and this confidence was further reinforced by the arrival of Force Z, a squadron of British warships dispatched to the defense of Singapore, including the battleship HMS Prince of Wales , and cruiser HMS Repulse . The squadron was to have been accompanied by a third capital ship, the aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable , but it ran aground en route, leaving the squadron without air cover.\nLieutenant-General Arthur Percival , led by a Japanese officer, marches under a flag of truce to negotiate the capitulation of Allied forces in Singapore, on 15 February 1942. It was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history.\nOn 8 December 1941, Japanese forces landed at Kota Bharu in northern Malaya. Just two days after the start of the invasion of Malaya , Prince of Wales and Repulse were sunk 50\u00a0miles off the coast of Kuantan in Pahang , by a force of Japanese bombers and torpedo bomber aircraft, in the worst British naval defeat of World War II. Allied air support did not arrive in time to protect the two capital ships. [57] After this incident, Singapore and Malaya suffered daily air raids, including those targeting civilian structures such as hospitals or shop houses with casualties ranging from the tens to the hundreds each time.\nThe Japanese army advanced swiftly southward through the Malay Peninsula, crushing or bypassing Allied resistance. [58] The Allied forces did not have tanks, which they considered unsuitable in the tropical rainforest , and their infantry proved powerless against the Japanese light tanks . As their resistance failed against the Japanese advance, the Allied forces were forced to retreat southwards towards Singapore. By 31 January 1942, a mere 55 days after the start of the invasion, the Japanese had conquered the entire Malay Peninsula and were poised to attack Singapore. [59]\nJapanese POWs are taken to work where they were made to clear up the city during the British reoccupation in September 1945\nThe causeway linking Johor and Singapore was blown up by the Allied forces in an effort to stop the Japanese army. However, the Japanese managed to cross the Straits of Johor in inflatable boats days after. Several fights by the Allied forces and volunteers of Singapore's population against the advancing Japanese, such as the Battle of Pasir Panjang , took place during this period. [60] However, with most of the defenses shattered and supplies exhausted, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival surrendered the Allied forces in Singapore to General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Imperial Japanese Army on Chinese New Year , 15 February 1942. About 130,000 Indian, Australian and British troops became prisoners of war, many of whom would later be transported to Burma , Japan, Korea, or Manchuria for use as slave labour via prisoner transports known as \" hell ships .\" The fall of Singapore was the largest surrender of British-led forces in history. [61] Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war. [62]\nSingapore, renamed Syonan-to (\u662d\u5357\u5cf6 Sh\u014dnan-t\u014d, \"Bright Southern Island\" in Japanese), was occupied by the Japanese from 1942 to 1945. The Japanese army imposed harsh measures against the local population, with troops, especially the Kempeitai or Japanese military police , particularly ruthless in dealing with the Chinese population. [63] The most notable atrocity was the Sook Ching massacre of Chinese and Peranakan civilians, undertaken in retaliation against support of the war effort in China . The Japanese screened citizens (including children) to check if they were \" anti-Japanese \". If so, the \"guilty\" citizens would be sent away in a truck to be executed. These mass executions claimed between 25,000 and 50,000 lives in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese also launched massive purges against the Indian community, they secretly killed about 150,000 Tamil Indians and tens of thousands of malayalams from Malaya, Burma and Singapore in various places located near the Siam Railway . [64] The rest of the population suffered severe hardship throughout the three and a half years of Japanese occupation. [65] The Malay and Indians were forced to build the \"Death Railway\" , a railway between Thailand and Burma (Myanmar). Most of them died while building the railway. The Eurasians[ clarification needed ] were also caught as POWs (Prisoners of War).\n1945\u20131955: Post-war period[ edit ]\nChinese community in Singapore carrying the Flag of the Republic of China (written Long live the motherland) to celebrate the victory, also reflected the Chinese identity issues at that time.\nAfter the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten , Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command , returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, as well as the harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore . There was also a shortage of food, leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels. [66]\nThe failure of Britain to defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as an infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. The decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of anti-colonial and nationalist sentiments, epitomized by the slogan Merdeka , or \"independence\" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase self-governance for Singapore and Malaya. [66] On 1 April 1946, the Straits Settlements was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year. [67]\n1948\u20131951: First Legislative Council[ edit ]\nThe first Singaporean elections , held in March 1948, were limited as only six of the twenty-five seats on the Legislative Council were to be elected. Only British subjects had the right to vote, and only 23,000 or about 10% of those eligible registered to vote. Other members of the Council were chosen either by the Governor or by the chambers of commerce. [66] Three of the elected seats were won by a newly formed Singapore Progressive Party (SPP), a conservative party whose leaders were businessmen and professionals and were disinclined to press for immediate self-rule. The other three seats were won by independents.\nThree months after the elections, an armed insurgency by communist groups in Malaya \u2013 the Malayan Emergency \u2013 broke out. The British imposed tough measures to control left-wing groups in both Singapore and Malaya and introduced the controversial Internal Security Act , which allowed indefinite detention without trial for persons suspected of being \"threats to security\". Since the left-wing groups were the strongest critics of the colonial system, progress on self-government was stalled for several years. [66]\n1951\u20131955: Second Legislative Council[ edit ]\nA second Legislative Council election was held in 1951 with the number of elected seats increased to nine. This election was again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore , the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel , proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system . The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.\nThe election for the Legislative Assembly held on 2 April 1955 was a lively and closely fought affair, with several new political parties joining the fray. Unlike previous elections, voters were automatically registered, expanding the electorate to around 300,000. The SPP was soundly defeated in the election, winning only four seats. The newly formed, left-leaning Labour Front was the biggest winner with ten seats and it formed a coalition government with the UMNO - MCA Alliance, which won three seats. [66] Another new party, the People's Action Party (PAP), won three seats.\n1953\u20131954 The Fajar trial[ edit ]\nFajar trial was the first sedition trial in the post-war Malaysia and Singapore. The Fajar was the publication of the University Socialist Club which mainly at that time circulated in the university campus. In May 1954, the members of the Fajar editorial board were arrested for publishing an allegedly seditious article named \"Aggression in Asia\". However, after three days of the trial, Fajar members were immediately released. The famous English Queen's Counsel D.N. Pritt acted as the lead counsel in the case and Lee Kuan Yew who was at that time a young lawyer assisted him as the junior counsel. The Club's final victory stands out as one of the notable landmarks in the progress of decolonisation of this part of the world. [68]\n1955\u20131963: Self-government[ edit ]\n1955\u20131959: Partial internal self-government[ edit ]\nDavid Marshall is seen here wearing his political uniform of white bush-jacket, complete with a hammer.\nDavid Marshall , leader of the Labour Front, became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. He presided over a shaky government, receiving little cooperation from both the colonial government and the other local parties. Social unrest was on the rise, and in May 1955, the Hock Lee bus riots broke out, killing four people and seriously discrediting Marshall's government. [69] In 1956, the Chinese middle school riots broke out among students in The Chinese High School and other schools, further increasing the tension between the local government and the Chinese students and unionists who were regarded of having communist sympathies.\nIn April 1956, Marshall led a delegation to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks , but the talks failed when the British were reluctant to give up control over Singapore's internal security. The British were concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots. Marshall resigned following the failure of the talk.\nThe new Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock , launched a crackdown on communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many trade union leaders and several pro-communist members of the PAP under the Internal Security Act . [70] The British government approved of Lim's tough stance against communist agitators, and when a new round of talks was held beginning in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. A State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced by a Yang di-Pertuan Negara or head of state . In August 1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament providing for the establishment of the State of Singapore. [70]\n1959\u20131963: Full internal self-government[ edit ]\nElections for the new Legislative Assembly were held in May 1959.  The People's Action Party (PAP) won the polls in a landslide victory, winning forty-three of the fifty-one seats. They accomplished this by courting the Chinese-speaking majority, particularly those in the labour unions and radical student organizations. Its leader Lee Kuan Yew , a young Cambridge-educated lawyer, became the first Prime Minister of Singapore.\nThe PAP's victory was at first viewed with dismay by foreign and local business leaders because some party's members were pro-communists. Many businesses promptly shifted their headquarters from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. [70] Despite these ill omens, the PAP government embarked on a vigorous program to address Singapore's various economic and social problems. Economic development was overseen by the new Minister of Finance Goh Keng Swee , whose strategy was to encourage foreign and local investment with measures ranging from tax incentives to the establishment of a large industrial estate in Jurong . [70] The education system was revamped to train a skilled workforce and the English language was promoted over the Chinese language as the language of instruction. To eliminate labour unrest, existing labour unions were consolidated, sometimes forcibly, into a single umbrella organisation, called the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) with strong oversight from the government. On the social front, an aggressive and well-funded public housing program was launched to solve the long-standing housing problem. More than 25,000 high-rise, low-cost apartments were constructed during the first two years of the program. [70]\nCampaign for merger[ edit ]\nDespite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders, including Lee and Goh, believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya. They felt that the historic and economic ties between Singapore and Malaya were too strong for them to continue as separate nations. Furthermore, Singapore lacked natural resources, and faced both a declining entrep\u00f4t trade and a growing population which required jobs. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market, eliminating trade tariffs, and thus supporting new industries which would solve the ongoing unemployment woes.\nAlthough the PAP leadership campaigned vigorously for a merger, the sizable pro-communist wing of the PAP were strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence as the ruling party of Malaya, United Malays National Organisation , was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. The UMNO leaders were also skeptical of the  idea of a merger due to their distrust of the PAP government and concerns that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended. The issue came to a head in 1961 when pro-communist PAP minister Ong Eng Guan defected from the party and beat a PAP candidate in a subsequent by-election, a move that threatened to bring down Lee's government.\nFaced with the prospect of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman , mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia , comprising existing Federation of Malaya , Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak . The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. [70] The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.\nOn 9 July 1963, the leaders of Singapore, Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak signed the Malaysia Agreement to establish the Federation of Malaysia. [70]\n1963\u20131965: Singapore in Malaysia[ edit ]\nThe founding father of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore.\nOn 16 September 1963, Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak were merged and Malaysia was formed. [70] The union was rocky from the start. During the 1963 Singapore state elections , a local branch of United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) took part in the election despite an earlier UMNO's agreement with the PAP not to participate in the state's politics during Malaysia's formative years. Although UMNO lost all its bids, relations between PAP and UMNO worsened. The PAP, in a tit-for-tat, challenged UMNO candidates in the 1964 federal election as part of the Malaysian Solidarity Convention , winning one seat in Malaysian Parliament.\nRacial tensions increased as ethnic Chinese and other non-Malay ethnic groups in Singapore rejected the discriminatory policies imposed by the Malays such as quotas for the Malays as special privileges were granted to the Malays guaranteed under Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia . There were also other financial and economic benefits that were preferentially given to Malays. Lee Kuan Yew and other political leaders began advocating for the fair and equal treatment of all races in Malaysia, with a rallying cry of \" Malaysian Malaysia !\".\nMeanwhile, the Malays in Singapore were being increasingly incited by the federal government's accusations that the PAP was mistreating the Malays. The external political situation was also tense; Indonesian President Sukarno declared a state of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) against Malaysia and initiated military and other actions against the new nation, including the bombing of MacDonald House in Singapore 10 March 1965 by Indonesian commandos, killing three people. [71] Indonesia also conducted sedition activities to provoke the Malays against the Chinese. [70] Numerous racial riots resulted and curfews were frequently imposed to restore order. The most notorious riots were the 1964 Race Riots that first took place on Prophet Muhammad 's birthday on 21 July with twenty three people killed and hundreds injured, and also, many people by then still hated the rest. During the unrest, the price of food skyrocketed when transport system was disrupted, causing further hardship for the people.\nThe state and federal governments also had conflicts on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur . Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states.[ citation needed ] The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew .\nSeparation and interdependence[ edit ]\nSeeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from the federation. Goh Keng Swee , who had become skeptical of merger's economic benefits for Singapore, convinced Lee Kuan Yew that the separation had to take place. UMNO and PAP representatives worked out the terms of separation in extreme secrecy in order to present the British government, in particular, with a fait accompli.\nOn the morning of 9 August 1965, the Parliament of Malaysia voted 126\u20130 in favor of a constitutional amendment expelling Singapore from the federation; hours later, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Republic of Singapore Independence Act, establishing the island as an independent and sovereign republic.  A tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced in a televised press conference that Singapore had become a sovereign, independent nation. In a widely remembered quote, he stated: \"For me, it is a moment of anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories.\" [72] [73] The new state became the Republic of Singapore, with Yusof bin Ishak appointed as its first President . [74]\n1965\u2013present: Republic of Singapore[ edit ]\n1965 to 1979[ edit ]\nThe Jurong Industrial Estate was developed in the 1960s to industrialise the economy.\nAfter gaining independence abruptly, Singapore faced a future filled with uncertainties. The Konfrontasi was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of natural resources and land. [75] Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the Commonwealth in October that year. Foreign minister Sinnathamby Rajaratnam headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries. [76] On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore. Singapore later co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on 8 August 1967 and was admitted into the Non-Aligned Movement in 1970. [77]\nThe Economic Development Board had been set up in 1961 to formulate and implement national economic strategies, focusing on promoting Singapore's manufacturing sector. [78] Industrial estates were set up, especially in Jurong , and foreign investment was attracted to the country with tax incentives. The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The service industry also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like Shell and Esso to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world. [75] The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. [79] The Housing Development Board set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, the majority of the population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore. [80]\nBritish troops had remained in Singapore following its independence, but in 1968, London announced its decision to withdraw the forces by 1971. [81] With the secret aid of military advisers from Israel , Singapore rapidly established the Singapore Armed Forces , with the help of a national service program introduced in 1967. [82] Since independence, Singaporean defense spending has been approximately five percent of GDP.  Today, the Singapore Armed Forces are among the best-equipped in Asia.[ citation needed ]\nThe 1980s and 1990s[ edit ]\nTraffic in Singapore, 1981. Prior to the introduction of the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) in 1990, vehicles per capita in Singapore was the highest in ASEAN .\nTop view of Bukit Batok West. Large scale public housing development has created high housing ownership among the population.\nFurther economic success continued through the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was developed to become a major airline. [83] The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period. Singapore emerged as an important transportation hub and a major tourist destination.[ citation needed ]\nThe Housing Development Board (HDB) continued to promote public housing with new towns, such as Ang Mo Kio , being designed and built. These new residential estates have larger and higher-standard apartments and are served with better amenities. Today, 80\u201390% of the population lives in HDB apartments. In 1987, the first Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line began operation, connecting most of these housing estates and the city centre. [84]\nThe political situation in Singapore continues to be dominated by the People's Action Party .  The PAP won all the parliamentary seats in every election between 1966 and 1981. [85] The PAP rule is termed authoritarian by some activists and opposition politicians who see the strict regulation of political and media activities by the government as an infringement on political rights. [86] The conviction of opposition politician Chee Soon Juan for illegal protests and the defamation lawsuits against J.B. Jeyaretnam have been cited by the opposition parties as examples of such authoritarianism. [87] The lack of separation of powers between the court system and the government led to further accusations by the opposition parties of miscarriage of justice .[ citation needed ]\nThe government of Singapore underwent several significant changes. Non-Constituency Members of Parliament were introduced in 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) was introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament. [88] Nominated Members of Parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs. [89] The Constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an Elected President who has veto power in the use of national reserves and appointments to public office. [90] The opposition parties have complained that the GRC system has made it difficult for them to gain a foothold in parliamentary elections in Singapore , and the plurality voting system tends to exclude minority parties. [91]\nIn 1990, Lee Kuan Yew passed the reins of leadership to Goh Chok Tong , who became the second prime minister of Singapore. Goh presented a more open and consultative style of leadership as the country continued to modernize. In 1997, Singapore experienced the effect of the Asian financial crisis and tough measures, such as cuts in the CPF contribution, were implemented.[ citation needed ]\nLee's programs in Singapore had a profound effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping , to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods. [92]\nSingapore went through some of its most serious postwar crises in the early 21st century, including the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the rising threat of terrorism . In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered [93] and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act . [94] Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. [95] More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities. [96] There are also increasing reforms in the Education system. Primary education was made compulsory in 2003. [97]\nIn 2004, then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong , the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew , took over from incumbent Goh Chok Tong and became the third prime minister of Singapore. He introduced several policy changes, including the reduction of national service duration from two and a half years to two years, and the legalisation of casino gambling . [98] Other efforts to raise the city's global profile included the reestablishment of the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008, and the hosting of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics .\nThe general election of 2006 was a landmark election because of the prominent use of the internet and blogging to cover and comment on the election, circumventing the official media. [99] The PAP returned to power, winning 82 of the 84 parliamentary seats and 66% of the votes. [100]\nOn 3 June 2009, Singapore commemorated 50 years of self-governance .\nThe iconic Marina Bay Sands integrated resort. Opened in 2010, it has become a key feature of Singapore's modern skyline.\nSingapore's move to increase her attractiveness as a tourist destination was further boosted in March 2010 with the opening of Universal Studios Singapore at Resorts World Sentosa. [101] In the same year, Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resorts was also opened. Marina Bay Sands was billed as the world's most expensive standalone casino property at S$ 8 billion. [102] On 31 December 2010, it was announced that Singapore's economy grew by 14.7% for the whole year, the best growth on record ever for the country. [103]\nThe general election of 2011 was yet another watershed election as it was the first time a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was lost by the ruling party PAP, to the opposition Workers' Party . [104] The final results saw a 6.46% swing against the PAP from the 2006 elections to 60.14%, its lowest since independence. [105] Nevertheless, PAP won 81 out of 87 seats and maintained its parliamentary majority. [106]\nLee Kuan Yew , founding father and the  first Prime Minister of Singapore, died on 23 March 2015. Singapore declared a period of national mourning from 23\u201329 March. [107] Lee Kuan Yew was accorded a state funeral.\nFireworks over the Marina Bay skyline following the conclusion of the 2015 National Day Parade on 9 August 2015.\nThe year 2015 also saw Singapore celebrate her Golden Jubilee of 50 years of independence. An extra day of holiday, 7 August 2015, was declared to celebrate Singapore's Golden Jubilee. Fun packs, which are usually given to people who attend the National Day Parade were given to every Singaporean and PR household. In commemoration of the significant milestone, the 2015 National Day Parade was the first ever parade to be held both at the Padang and the Float at Marina Bay. NDP 2015 was the first National Day Parade without the founding leader Lee Kuan Yew , who never missed a single National Day Parade since 1966.\nThe 2015 General Elections was held on 11 September shortly after the 2015 National Day Parade. The election was the first since Singapore's independence which saw all seats contested. [108] The election was also the first after the death of Lee Kuan Yew (the nation's first Prime Minister and an MP until his passing). The ruling party PAP received its best results since 2001 with 69.86% of the popular vote, an increase of 9.72% from the previous election in 2011 . [109]\nFollowing amendments to the Constitution of Singapore , Singapore held her first reserved Presidential Elections in 2017 . The election was the first to be reserved for a particular racial group under a hiatus-triggered model. The 2017 election was reserved for candidates from the minority Malay community . Then Speaker of Parliament Halimah Yacob won the elections though a walkover and was inaugurated as the eighth President of Singapore on 14 September 2017, becoming the first female President of Singapore.\nThe country celebrates its National Day on 9 August each year.\n\"Singapore: History, Singapore 1994\" .

            "4.6 (3)\n4.2 (21)\n228 18\n< $10\nOpened in January 1996, the mission of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) is to preserve and present the art histories and contemporary art practices of Singapore and the Southeast Asian region.\n4.0\nAdmission was free when I went. But I can see why. There were many exhibitions that were being installed so what I saw was very, very little and somewhat disappointing. So I will not comment on SAM.\nInstead, I will focus on the new extension to SAM which is called SAM at 8Q. The architecture is similar to that of the main building. Only difference really is the lack of long corridors in this one. Which makes it a lot easier actually.\nThe current exhibition needs to be visited! They currently have about 4 galleries open and each one features artists from a specific Asian country. Most of them was well-put together, incredibly nostalgic, and thought-provoking. The stairwell is also hand illustrated by a Singaporean artist which is really dark but stunning and impressive.\nThe gallery sitters were all really nice and friendly so it does add to the experience of it all. So go visit our local and neighbouring countries' talents!\nCN\nCleo Ngiam\nWhat in the SAM hill\nOctober 18, 2012\n5.0\nI remember, back in the olden days, a time when the general public's idea of art was paintings of sampans and tacky oils of flowers in vases. Along came SAM with its egalitarian approach, highly accessible agenda and downright fun activities.\nThe night lights was a big success, although I did wish that people would not behave like philistines when inside the museum exhibits. Chattering loudly into your mobile phone really isn't cool.\nIt is great that artists of international renown such as Jia Ai Li (currently on show) are so easily accessible to everybody right here in Singapore for free (on Fridays anyway).\nMarry me, SAM.\nIn the artist's shoes\n4.0\nThis art museum located aptly at Dhoby Ghaut is again another attraction that is of close distance to other good finds in Singapore such as Bras Basah Complex and many more.\nThat area itself boasts the artistic scene of Singapore, whereby the illustrations on the walls lining the road are hand painted by local students.\nThe museum holds and exhibits contemporary artworks of artists mainly from Southeast Asia and Asia. This has also been a place where schools frequent for learning journeys. Just like the other day, I was greeted by a group of students curiously and enthusiastically taking photos with the exhibits. It is definitely a good place for everyone, be it a child or an adult, one can surely bring something of value home with him or her after a trip there.\nThe interior of the musuem attracted me the most, where the building is cleanly clad in white and its structure remains as a colonial structure that reminds one of the history of Singapore where we were once a British colony. The floor tiles are pretty much old school, with a tinge of Peranakan style, and is absolutely one of the features of Singapore as well.\nThe artworks and exhibits are properly guarded by security and the staff, whereby they are consistent and attentive in ensuring that visitors do not touch them and do not cross the yellow line that is cordoned off and drawn to prevent the damage of those articles.\nA fairly clean and comfortable place to spend the afternoon at, as one would be absolutely drawn towards the amazing art pieces and would have forgotten about everything for that while.\nE\nJanuary 18, 2016\n4.0\nI\u2019m lazy and hate the sun, so the perfect outings or gatherings for me involve shopping, eating dinner, or staying at home. But SAM has become popular recently, and the photobooth print-outs you can get there were honestly what caught my attention.\nWhile I\u2019m not exactly the most cultured person around, the exhibitions were able to keep me interested. The art is very modern and relatable with some exhibits being interactive as well, and hence suitable for the youth. However, the layout of the museum does get confusing - the signs and directions are unclear, and I sometimes found myself walking in circles.\nTo be extremely honest, many of my friends, me included, visit SAM because of its photobooth, so I think I\u2019d review it a little. The photobooth is extremely squeezy, barely able to fit two people. Otherwise, it\u2019s affordable - $4 for a coloured print-out and a black & white one.\nWith the exhibits being air-conditioned, and SAM being only a short walk away from Bras Basah MRT station, a visit to SAM would be the perfect date when it\u2019s too hot or rainy.\nM\nThought-provoking\n4.0\nLocated in the former St Joseph\u2019s Institution compound, the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) is rich in history, and a great place to go to explore contemporary art.\nWhen I visited the museum, the exhibition they were having was After Utopia, a look at our pursuit of a perfect life, at the relentless human pursuit of a fantastical flawless world. It explored many different themes, and had works of art across different mediums, from paintings to sculptures. My favourite piece was located in what was the former chapel- a series of glittering atomic bombs hanging over the empty expanse. It questions the concept of the church as a sanctuary, and brings to mind a curiosity about the world as we perceive it.\nGenerally, SAM has intriguing exhibitions that feature more than art, and they often allow you to probe deeper into your mind. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit to expand your worldview.\nSY\nStefanie Yeo\nThe state of ultimate tranquillity\nNovember 09, 2014\n4.0\nThere is this thing about museums that allows me to be calmer than usual. Probably it is just looking at the different art work being displayed. Singapore Art Museum is one of the museums in Singapore that changes its exhibits once every few months. The exhibits never fail to amaze me, the tremendous amount of effort being put in by every artist on each piece of their work. I am always intrigued by how there is a story behind each piece of work.\nEntrance is free for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PR). Prices for foreign citizens are at S$10 for adults. However, they can enjoy free entry every Friday night from 6 \u2013 9 P.M. For photography enthusiast, Singapore Art Museum is a good place to snap a few good photos. Do note that flash photography is not allowed and all photographs taken are for non-commercial use only.\nThe current exhibit includes the Still Moving exhibit, my personal favourite for now and Medium at Large. These exhibits will be available till the start of next year. Check out their websites for the latest exhibits. In addition, the museum will have interactive exhibits catered for children and adults. It is one to look out for especially during the school holiday period. Singapore Art Museum \u2013 definitely one of the places to check out regardless whether you are a tourist or local!\nA\nAmanda\nSTILL MOVING exhibition\nOctober 24, 2014\n5.0\nI went to SAM@8Q with my best friend for the STILL MOVING exhibition! There are three co-curated exhibitions focusing on the nature of the image, as explored in the art of photography and new media.\nThe first is 'Afterimage', which is an exhibition on contemporary Southeast Asian photographic practices, in partnership with the Singapore International Photography Festival. The second is 'Time Present' which are works selected from the Deutsche Bank collection featuring milestones in international photography. The third is \"Image & Illusion\", which experiment new media works from the collection of the Yokohama Museum of Art.\nNo matter if you are a amateur or professional photographer, if you like photography, then this exhibition is suited for you!\nOne of the best part for this exhibition was the photo booth. You get to take 8 instant photos (4 colored and 4 Black & White) for $2, You can leave the best photos with them and stand a chance to win attractive prizes. But we did not leave any because we rather keep it for our memories!\nIt will be on display from October 2014 to February 2015, so do head down to have a look at it, since it's FREE anyways! :D\nOptional Information:\nBest part:\nRecommend to a friend:\nRe-live the past\nJune 25, 2014\n4.0\nLast Saturday I attended a one of the free SG50 Tours at museum. You can register for the Reminiscing the Past \u2013 Stories of Waterloo and Queen Streets tour online at this website : https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/reminiscing-the-past-stories-of-waterloo-and-queen-streets-registration-11581916825 . The meeting place is at the Glass Hall, Level 1, Singapore Art Museum and it is free. A goodie bag was given and I was surprised to find a exercise book in it. Kind of reminding me of primary school.\nThe museum used to be St. Joseph Institution. In this tour, we have former students from St. Joseph Institution with us. They shared with us the stories they experienced during schooling in the old building. For example the ghost stories in the building, the tricks they played on the younger students. It was interesting to find that there was a hidden chapel in the building. It was a day filled with interesting facts about the place. Interesting and enjoyable experience.\nOptional Information:\nDoreen Tan\nEye- opening experience\nDecember 06, 2013\n4.0\nThe first time I visited Singapore Art Museum was on a school trip. I was particularly fascinated by paintings of famous artists, such as Van Gogh, and was captivated by the intricately carved figurines.\nThe best thing about Singapore Arts Museum is that it gives a free admission to local students and other specific group of people, such as local senior citizens above the age of sixty years old. Even if the entry admission is not free in your case, the price is affordable and totally worth it. The interesting aspect of Singapore Art Museum is that the art and displays are changed every few times a year, and going there a second time promises new exhibitions.\nThis is a place not only for tourists in Singapore, but for locals too. Singapore Arts Museum provides a platform for the appreciation of the arts, and there are sometimes really interesting exhibitions which mixes in technology, and allows audience interaction, which actually makes the whole experience captivating and attractive.\nM\nHub for the arts\n4.5\nThe ongoing showcase, Untitled, featuring our locally home-bred artists ranging from Lim Tzay Chuen, Chua Ek Kay to Tang Da Wu creates a sense of ambiguity in their intentions. One thing beautiful about this exhibition lies in the power that has been conferred unto the viewer and audience: the decisive power of interpretation of tone, attitude and the work.\nAudience members are given little tear-outs and encouraged to write potential titles for the works - something that is considered novel since the times of traditional art where the viewer was regarded as the passive party at the side lines.\nAlthough the current exhibition is stipulated to run until sometime next year, together with other changing exhibits, there are permanent exhibits in one of the studios on level 2.\nWith the nostalgic interior and the wooden lacquered floors and tiles, the Singapore Art Museum is the place that honors the pioneer artists to the contemporary artists of today. The immersion into the art world of beauty and aesthetics seem to be the priority for the Singapore Art Museum at all times. Exhibitions that are not to be missed would be the Annual Singapore Night Festival (Or Night Lights) - with extensive artworks dealing with lighting - and the Singapore Biennale - a platform for exposure to the myraid of art forms that the Singapore artists pursue in today's evolving world.\nIn short, the place to be if you want to visit a hub for the arts.\nOptional Information:\nLocation:\nSAM\nSAM. Not bad.\nFebruary 14, 2013\n4.0\nFrequenting the Singapore Art Museum became second nature the moment I chose to become an art student several years ago. Place me on blind fold and I may just manoeuvre myself around this very much accustomed venue, without banging into any items. Or even leave them wobbling. It wasn't exactly the world's best museum ever. However, the strategic location and architecture certainly placed itself into my book of awe.\nBoasting an impressive range of preserved British architecture, the Singapore Art Museum caught me off guard for several moments. It's detail, the arches and it's layout is certainly the ideal recipe that left me bubbling in mesmerisation. I believed I spent several more hours marvelling and even drawing the architecture, than actually entering the compound to absorb in the carefully displayed artworks.\nThe toilet there was not exactly an ordinary one. It had polished white ceramic tiles with white doors and white stools. Oh yes, the basins are white too. Of course. The doors wasn't a usual one either. It was rather small, I could see the crowns of the occupants heads who are standing upon completing their business in there.\nOptional Information:\nBest part:\nInspiration\n5.0\nI am an art student and I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and concepts. SAM has been an one of my avenues for that, and my artsy friends and I have been coming here once in a while to do some exploration which would give us ideas and inspire us to make art.\nI like SAM in that they regularly have really interesting exhibitions and collections. They sometimes also have guest artists from other countries who host events where we can get up close and personal with these artists.\nSAM is also a good place for young learners to learn the art of appreciating art from a young age. I've been to SAM with my school a few times as field trips and those were one of favourite kinds of field trips.\nOptional Information:\n-\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2019 TheSmartLocal.com\n"

            "Search\nOur initial search for things we\u00a0wanted to see and do during our 5 days in Singapore didn\u2019t bring up the MacRitchie Trail.\u00a0 \u00a0When most people think Singapore, they think \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d, high-end shopping, Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and other amazing tourist destinations near downtown.\u00a0 \u00a0 All things we wanted to see but after spending a relaxing, peaceful week exploring Hoi An, Vietnam , we were looking for quieter, more nature-oriented activities.\nOf course we started with the basic searches like \u201cTop Cheap/Free Things to do in Singapore\u201d and came up with oodles of lists of items that could have had us busy in and around the downtown area for at least a week or more.\u00a0 But you know us.\u00a0 \u00a0We kept digging.\u00a0 Looking for the local gems that most tourists miss out on.\nMy next Google search: \u201cHiking in Singapore\u201d\nBam.\u00a0 MacRitchie Reservoir Hiking Trail\nNow my search results were filled with lists that included the MacRitchie Trail and TreeTop Walk.\nThe MacRitchie Reservoir is the oldest one in Singapore.\u00a0 It\u2019s located dead center of the country of Singapore and while we took the MRT and hoofed it to the park, there are also plenty of bus stops to save you a few more steps.\u00a0 It was completed in 1868 and is a popular spot for locals to come to get in their daily run or walk and say hello to the local monitor lizards and Macaque monkeys (more on that in a minute\u2026.)\nThere are a couple different trails you can follow but we opted to take the time for the full 11km loop including the TreeTop Walk.\u00a0 \u00a0I would label the trails as moderate for the most part.\u00a0 \u00a0Well taken care of, mostly dirt/rock and plenty wide in most places.\nBikes and dogs are not allowed on the trails either so other than the occasional chatty group of humans, it\u2019s a quiet, peaceful hike.\nWe started from the Reservoir Car Park on the southeast side where you can also find the Mushroom Cafe.\u00a0 We didn\u2019t stop for food but it seems to be the only place around the park so if you are hungry, stop here.\nThe weather in Singapore is hot and humid.\u00a0 Most days I was sweating before we even left our hotel.\u00a0 So be sure to bring along plenty of water and some snacks too.\u00a0 \u00a0But beware the monkeys!\nI don\u2019t think we were even 1km into our hike before we met our first monitor lizard.\u00a0 \u00a0Maybe 50ft later, our first Macaque monkeys !\nThere are plenty of signs warning you not to feed the monkeys or openly walk around eating food in crinkly bags.\u00a0 \u00a0I guess they have been known to swipe food from visitors since they have become a little too friendly.\u00a0 We never had any issues with them and probably saw 25 or more of them during our hike.\u00a0 \u00a0Mostly they kept to the trees, picking off berries as they swung over our heads but we did get to see a family of them come down onto the path and casually stroll along down the boardwalk like they were just out enjoying the weather.\nAnd if you love birding, definitely come in the earlier hours and you will see a number of different birds along the trail as well.\u00a0 \u00a0I didn\u2019t have the most perfect lens on the camera for getting good close up shots of the birds but below are a couple worth sharing.\nI can tell you though from looking at a list of current sightings in that area on WaxwingEco.com, we saw Indian Cuckoo, Rock Pigeons, Asian Koel, Purple Heron, Collared Kingfisher, Red-crowned Barbet, Black-naped Oriole and the one that was our favorite, the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo.\nThe Greater Racket-tailed Drongo will look like any other blackbird at first glance but if you look closely, you will notice he has these long secondary feathers that trail behind his tail feathers.\u00a0 You will usually find one of them perched out in the open nearby where the Macaque monkeys are moving around.\u00a0 What we were told is that the monkeys stir up insects as they swing between the branches and the Drongos will catch and eat those insects.\nOn the northern end of the 11km MacRitchie Trail is the TreeTop Walk and this is one you definitely don\u2019t want to miss.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s a free-standing suspension bridge that connects the two highest points (Bukit Peirce and Bukit Kalang) in MacRitchie.\nThe distance to the entrance of the TreeTop Walk is about 4.5 km (1.5 \u2013 2 hr walk) from the main MacRitchie Reservoir Park.\u00a0 But you can also access it from the car park on Venus Drive.\u00a0 The distance from the car park is only about 2.5 km (45 mins \u2013 1 hr walk).\u00a0 The bridge only allows for one-way traffic from near the Ranger Station so keep this in mind too.\nThe weather was hot but quite nice on the Monday we hiked the trail.\u00a0 But we had to come back again on Tuesday since we didn\u2019t know the TreeTop Walk was closed on Mondays with the exception of public holidays.\u00a0 Gah!! What?!? Dang it\u2026 Totally worth the second trip though \ud83d\ude42\nThe Reservoir Park and TreeTop Walk are both free to enter\nSingapore National Parks Pages: MacRitchie Reservoir Park and the TreeTop Walk\nTrail grade on average is moderate\nOnly bathrooms are at the Ranger Station.\u00a0 There are water fountains there too\nFull loop trail is 11km.\u00a0 Approximate walking time: 4 hours\nTreeTop Walk is free.\u00a0 It is closed on Mondays (except public holidays) and closes at 5pm each day\nClosest MRT station is Caldecott on the Circle Line (orange)\nBikes and dogs are not allowed on the trails.\nHave you been to the MacRitchie Reservoir, TreeTop Walk or other great hiking trail in Singapore?\u00a0 Tell us about it in the comments!\nLike this page? Please share it and spread the love!\n11 Apr 2020 Reply\nDelighted you found MacRitchie, it\u2019s a gem. Next time you come to SG, pl do look us up. We run off beaten tracks all over the island \u2013 nature, heritage, culture. No \u201cattractions\u201d for us! Cheers, Jane (www.janestours.sg)  PS we\u2019re in lockdown just now but happier times will return\nKris\n12 Apr 2020 Reply\nIt really is a gem!  Thanks for reaching out.  Hope we can all safely travel again soon!\nLeave a Reply\nWho We Are\nMark & Kris \u2013 A couple of wanderlusters, photographers and coffee lovers \u2013\ndocumenting our travels and how we make money online.\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\n\u00a9 FASerra/www.pixabay.com\nThe Singapore Botanic Gardens cover an impressive 82 hectares of land right in the heart of the city. A stone\u2019s throw from the Orchard Road shopping belt, these gardens are home to over 10,000 species of flora not to mention a fair number of gigantic monitor lizards and other jungle creatures. In 2015, the Gardens became one of only three gardens to earn UNESCO World Heritage Site status.\nThe Botanic Gardens are divided into three major zones ; Tanglin Core, Central Core and Bukit Timah Core . Considering the immense size of the gardens, a great way to see all of the attractions is to divide and conquer \u2013 maybe visit each section on three separate trips. However, if you are just passing through the region and do not have that much time, visit this page to download four different walking guides designed for different audiences and ranging from 40-90 minutes in duration. As with any predominantly outdoor activity in Singapore , make sure to always be carrying water bottles and stay well-hydrated.\nAug 22, 2016 at 6:14pm PDT\nThe Tanglin Core is exciting from the get-go, as the Tanglin gate is a sight in itself. Highlights in this area are Swan Lake, the Sundial Garden, the Bandstand and the Bonsai Garden. Swan Lake is the oldest lake in the gardens, home to several graceful swans, try to find the slightly hidden, quieter side of it near Dell Lane to catch a glimpse of these swans as they glide through water lilies.\nThe Bandstand has become famous as the visual icon of the Singapore Botanic Gardens , a white gazebo-like structure that was once used for musical performances and is now often the location for wedding shoots \u2013 or shelter if you get caught in one of Singapore\u2019s infamous, no-warning torrential downpours (luckily they usually only last 15-20 minutes).\nJun 29, 2015 at 2:21am PDT\nIf you travel to the gardens via the MRT and get off at the Botanic Gardens stop on the Circle Line, you will exit the station and find yourself at the Bukit Timah gate, on the far east side of the park. This is the perfect location to access the Bukit Timah Core. Due to its proximity to the MRT, this is usually the busiest section of the park, especially on weekends. Some highlights are the Trellis Garden, Eco-Lake and the Foliage Garden. The trellis garden features climbing plants that are displayed in such a way that you can walk through them. Visit Eco-Lake to see Australian black swans and other waterfowl. The Foliage Garden has many exciting plants, but the best has to be the alienesque, red, carnivorous pitcher plants.\nAug 21, 2016 at 7:31am PDT\nFinally, the Central Core is home to the garden\u2019s most famous attraction; the Orchid Garden. Entrance to this is $5, but well worth it, as you can see almost 2,000 different species of Orchids. Other highlights are the Healing Garden (full of plants with medicinal properties and therefore not ones you would generally see out in the wild as easily) the Fragrance Garden and the Evolution Garden.\nAug 22, 2016 at 6:03pm PDT\nThe park is open daily from 5:00am-00:00am, however, check their official website for information regarding specific gardens and exhibitions.\n"

            "Search for a topic\nIt\u2019s a new year! Time to start anew!\nWe tasked our millennial intern to put aside his late nights and get up early to catch the 7 am sunrise in one of our island\u2019s most beautiful spot \u2013 Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Read on for his report:\nWaiting for sunrise at Fantail Pod.\nBeez, beez, beezzzz. It is 5:30 am. Don\u2019t hit the snooze button. Instead, sit up. It\u2019s time to get dressed, grab a cup of coffee and slowly make my way to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve !\nSure, it is painful to wake up at this forsaken hour on a weekend morning but it is well worth it. The sights, accompanied by the ambience of nature, are rewards for my effort. After all, there is nothing like catching the sunrise at 7 am, listening to soothing sounds of the gently lapping tide and the melody of the birds in the background. It feels like it is just you and the elements.\nAs the sunlight slowly starts to creep in and awake the flora and fauna around you, keep your eyes, ears and other senses peeled. You never know what you might see in the density of the wetland.\n1. Mangroves\nThe mangroves along the Coastal Trail.\nSungei Buloh Wetland Reserve has the largest patch of mangroves on mainland Singapore, covering a total land mass of around 100 hectares. The word \u2018mangrove\u2019 is used to describe the individual plants and the entire community of plants that make up the forest.\nMangrove plants grow in the intertidal region and are able to withstand being partially submerged in seawater during high tide while growing in oxygen-poor mud. Sturdy plants aren\u2019t they! For more information on mangroves, click here .\nAerial view of the mangroves seen from Eagle Point\nA commonly sighted resident of these mangrove swamps is the mudskipper, which is truly a unique creature. It is characterised as a fish because it has fins, gills and other properties of a fish, yet it is literally a fish out of water!\nJust like how a scuba diver has tanks of air to help him breathe underwater, the mudskipper has \u2018tanks of water\u2019 in their gills. At low tide, they are often seen on mudflats, near their \u2018swimming pool\u2019. At high tide, they can be seen clinging onto mangrove tree roots.\nGiant mudskipper (Periophthalmodon schlosseri)\nRemember about keeping your senses peeled? I managed to spot a dog-faced water snake (Schneider's Bockadam) in the water. I know what you are thinking\u2026why \u2018dog-faced\u2019? The name derives from its protruding eyes, which is unusual for snakes. This snake camouflages with the mud and leaf litter and is pretty shy. So it is really quite rare to be able to spot this snake!\nSpot the dog-faced water snake!\n2. Bird-watching\nAnother benefit of waking at the crack of dawn is that birds are usually more active during this time, welcoming the new day with their songs. If you are a shutterbug, the soft, golden morning sun is the kind of light you want to brighten up your photos.\nAt Buloh Tidal Ponds, you can spot all sorts of birds like the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), Milky Stork (Mycteria cinerea), Collared Kingfisher (Todiramphus chloris), and many more. Especially during the migratory season, which happens from September to March, you can expect to find migratory birds making their way to our parks and nature reserves. Some of them travel all the way from as far as Siberia!\nLittle Egret\nMilky Stork\nCollared Kingfisher\nOf course, you do not only have to be at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to enjoy everything that nature has to offer. The great thing about living in Singapore is that there are plenty of parks and nature reserves that provide a similar experience, like Pasir Ris Park , Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park , Kranji Marshes and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve .\nJust remember, it pays to be early and be alert, because you never know what you will stumble upon!\nCommon Waxbill (Estrilda astrild)\nCommon Sun Skink (Eutropis multifasciata)\nHere are some tips to make help you make the most of your morning visits:\n- Plan ahead; check the weather and tide timetable beforehand\n- Bring drinking water and pack your own snacks if required\n- Put on comfortable walking shoes with socks\n- Dress in comfortable clothes in light colours (preferably long pants and a long-sleeved shirt to prevent mosquito bites)\n- Wear a hat in non-bright colours\n- Bring a good pair of binoculars and/or camera\nThe Reserve is open from 7 am to 7 pm daily. Entering or remaining in the Reserve after 7 pm is not allowed.\nVolunteer with Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve\nVolunteers are truly gems; from conducting workshops and guided tours to helping out with conservation surveys, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve will not be where it is today without the help and contributions of volunteers. Click here to find out more about volunteering opportunities.\nLearn about the diverse plants and animals found in the various habitats of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. This weekly guided walk is suitable for everyone, including families with children.

In that period, we\u2019ve shared our investment insights and analysis, published hundreds of articles, and written about how anyone can achieve financial independence through prudent and long-term investing.\nAlong the way, we\u2019ve received several emails from readers who wanted a practical guide on how to start investing in Singapore. This was when we realised that while a blog is a great way to share our research and insights in a timely manner, it\u2019s not the best way to organise information about a topic in a practical, step-by-step sequence.\nSo we decided to compile a list of our best articles that will guide you step-by-step on what you need to do to start investing today. We hope this practical guide will help you get the ball rolling \u2014 especially if you\u2019re a beginner \u2013 and ultimately help you make better, more profitable investment decisions. \ud83d\ude0a\nHow to start investing in Singapore\n1. Before you start investing, it\u2019s important to set your personal financial goals and how much you need to save (and invest) to reach your target. These articles will show you how to plan ahead and get your personal finances in order before you put first dollar in the stock market.\n2. Once you have your finances in order, it\u2019s time to open a brokerage account. We\u2019ll show you how to open a brokerage account in Singapore and the minimum sum you to get started (it\u2019s not much, really).\n3. The next step is to choose you investment style that works best for you \u2014 based on your own risk profile, investment goals, and financial needs. Remember, any particular strategy can give you great returns as long as you do it right, and you\u2019re also free to combine different styles to suit your individual needs.\nValue-growth investing\n6. Your CPF is an important part of your financial planning and retirement. Here are some articles which show you how to make full use of your CPF and the important things you need to consider if you plan on investing your CPF.\nThe fifth perspective\nWe hope you find this guide on how to start investing in Singapore useful.

Many thanks for this wonderful guide, presented in an easy to understand and objective manner. I am a retiree and a new investor. I am interested in Index-based ETFs as they are diversified and low cost. You mentioned that the best way to invest in Vanguard ETFs are through US or Vanguard brokerages. I know Vanguard has presence in HK and Australia. Do you mean the brokerages in these countries? Further, which of these have the lowest expense rates in Total \u2013 iFast(in SG), the HK/Australia brokerages, IB, TDAmeritrade, Schwab, when it comes to US/Vanguard ETFs? Many thanks for your pointers!\nHi Sazali,\nThanks and you\u2019re most welcome! We suggest directly opening a U.S. brokerage account to trade U.S. securities; the fees are usually much lower compared to Singapore brokerages.\nInteractive Brokers is the cheapest but it charges you a US$10 monthly fee unless you make 10 trades per month or have US$100K in funds. If not, something like Charles Schwab is a good, solid option (US$4.95 per trade).\nSeptember 12, 2019 at 5:13 pm\nHi there, I\u2019m a foreigner living in Singapore and interested in investing in foreign stocks. According to your previous comments I assume the best beneficial way to invest in e.g. U.S. stocks is only by choosing those companies without paying a dividend due to the 30% withholding tax?\nDo you also have any knowledge in terms of tax payments in Singapore regarding the European stock market (Capital gains and dividends), e.g. UK and Germany stocks.\nMany thanks in advance.\nHi Cloud,\nYes, I\u2019d invest for growth instead of dividends in the U.S. markets due to the dividend withholding tax.\nThere is no capital gains tax in Singapore for stock investments: https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/What-is-Taxable-What-is-Not/Gains-from-Sale-of-Property\u2013Shares-and-Financial-Instruments/\nNovember 19, 2019 at 12:51 pm\nHi!

            "Word Association Lookup\nThe project \u00abWord Associations Network\u00bb gives you an opportunity to lookup associations with a given word. Word associations arise in the human\u2019s mind when reading or saying a word, or just thinking about the word. In order to retrieve the list of associations to a word, just type in the word in the search panel and press <Enter> key or \"Search\" button.\nIt is also possible to search for a word by the first letter. Click the desired letter on the navigation pane, and you will pass to a page containing a list of words, which start with the given letter.\nIf the results you are looking for are not on the first page of search results, you can click \"Next\" and \"Previous\" at the bottom of the page to see more results.\nFor better usability each word is accompanied by the explanatory articles from WordNet lexical database. The search results can also contain images, which depict the meaning of corresponding word. Click on the selected image in order to see it in higher resolution.\nThe Description of the Project\n\"Word Associations Network\" is inherently an ideographic dictionary or thesaurus. The project consists of three basic components: an associative dictionary, an explanatory dictionary, and a picture dictionary. The associative dictionary, the dictionary of associations, or analogical dictionary groups the words of the language by psychological perception, sense and meaning. The explanatory dictionary provides lexical meaning for every word. This dictionary often provides examples on the usage of a word. Picture vocabulary or visual dictionary contains graphic illustrations that depict the meaning of words.\nThe Definition of Word Association\nAssociation is one of the basic mechanisms of memory. In a sense, they can be called natural classifiers of the conceptual content of the vocabulary of the language. Ideas and concepts, which are available to the memory of a man are related. This relationship is based on the past experience of a man and, in the final analysis, more or less accurately reproduces objectively existing relationship between the phenomena of the real world. Under certain conditions, a revival of one idea or concept is accompanied by a revival of others ideas correlated with it. This phenomenon is called the association (a term proposed in the XVIII century by Locke).\nBased on the book V. V. Morkovkin \u00abIdeographic Dictionaries\u00bb (1970)\nClassification of Associations\nSince Aristotle the people distinguish association by similarity, contrast and contiguity.\nAssociation by similarity is based on the fact that the associated phenomena have some common features. It represents a result of generalization of the conditioned connection in which similar stimuli evoke similar reactions (for example, excitement of synonymic series with actualization of one of the synonyms: woe - unhappiness, sorrow, grief, sadness, and so on).\nClose to the association by similarity is association by contrast, the origin of which is explained by the presence in phenomena of opposite features. The physiological nature of the association by contrast is in the \"mutual induction of neural processes when strong stimuli ... cause great excitement in the beginning, and then successive inhibition in the same regions of the cerebral cortex. As a result, in the future one of the contrasting stimuli can cause immediately after it something that was caused before by another stimulus (contrast with given one)\" (for example, the phenomenon of antonyms: grief - joy, happiness \u2013 unhappiness, and so on).\nAssociation by contiguity comes into existence when events are situated close together in time or space. Currently, the three mentioned types of associations are classified as simple or mechanical. Along with them, more complex semantic association is distinguished. This is, in particular, the association reflecting generic and cause-and-effect relationship between the objects of the world (for example, a flower - a rose, a disease - death, and so on).\nBased on the book V. V. Morkovkin \u00abIdeographic Dictionaries\u00bb (1970)\nThe Role of Associations\nSince the associations reflect some significant relations between objects and phenomena of the real world, and thus between the concepts, it is reasonable to conclude that they play an important role in the structure of the lexical system of the language. This was pointed out as long ago as by N.V. Krushevskiy: \"Every word is linked to other words by ties of association by similarity; this similarity will not be only external, i.e. sound or structural, morphological, but also internal, semasiological. Or in other words: every word is capable, due to a special mental law, to bring in our mind other words with which it is similar, and is excited by these words ...\"\nBased on the book V. V.

            "In machine learning , na\u00efve Bayes classifiers are a family of simple \" probabilistic classifiers \" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (na\u00efve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models. [1] But they could be coupled with Kernel density estimation and achieve higher accuracy levels. [2] [3]\nNa\u00efve Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1960s. It was introduced (though not under that name) into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s, [4] and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization , the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (document categorization)(such as spam or legitimate , sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. With appropriate pre-processing, it is competitive in this domain with more advanced methods including support vector machines . [5] It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis . [6]\nNa\u00efve Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression , [7] :718 which takes linear time , rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. [8] All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but na\u00efve Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method. [7] [8]\nContents\nNaive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10\u00a0cm in diameter.  A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.\nFor some types of probability models, naive Bayes classifiers can be trained very efficiently in a supervised learning setting. In many practical applications, parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood ; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods.\nDespite their naive design and apparently oversimplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations. In 2004, an analysis of the Bayesian classification problem showed that there are sound theoretical reasons for the apparently implausible efficacy of naive Bayes classifiers. [9] Still, a comprehensive comparison with other classification algorithms in 2006 showed that Bayes classification is outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests . [10]\nAn advantage of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.[ citation needed ]\nAbstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector\nx\nrepresenting some n features (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities\np\nfor each of K possible outcomes or classes\nC\nk\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(C_{k}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )={\\frac {p(C_{k})\\ p(\\mathbf {x} \\mid C_{k})}{p(\\mathbf {x} )}}\\,}\nIn plain English, using Bayesian probability terminology, the above equation can be written as\nposterior\nprior\nlikelihood\nevidence\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{posterior}}={\\frac {{\\text{prior}}\\times {\\text{likelihood}}}{\\text{evidence}}}\\,}\nIn practice, there is interest only in the numerator of that fraction, because the denominator does not depend on\nC\nx\ni\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\nare given, so that the denominator is effectively constant.\nThe numerator is equivalent to the joint probability model\np\n{\\displaystyle p(C_{k},x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})\\,}\nwhich can be rewritten as follows, using the chain rule for repeated applications of the definition of conditional probability :\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}p(C_{k},x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})&=p(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\\\&=p(x_{1}\\mid x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\ p(x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\\\&=p(x_{1}\\mid x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\ p(x_{2}\\mid x_{3},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\ p(x_{3},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\\\&=\\cdots \\\\&=p(x_{1}\\mid x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\ p(x_{2}\\mid x_{3},\\ldots ,x_{n},C_{k})\\cdots p(x_{n-1}\\mid x_{n},C_{k})\\ p(x_{n}\\mid C_{k})\\ p(C_{k})\\\\\\end{aligned}}}\nNow the \"naive\" conditional independence assumptions come into play: assume that all features in\nx\nC\nk\n)\n.\np\n)\n,\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}p(C_{k}\\mid x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})&\\varpropto p(C_{k},x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})\\\\&=p(C_{k})\\ p(x_{1}\\mid C_{k})\\ p(x_{2}\\mid C_{k})\\ p(x_{3}\\mid C_{k})\\ \\cdots \\\\&=p(C_{k})\\prod _{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i}\\mid C_{k})\\,,\\end{aligned}}}\nwhere\nThis means that under the above independence assumptions, the conditional distribution over the class variable\nC\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(C_{k}\\mid x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})={\\frac {1}{Z}}p(C_{k})\\prod _{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i}\\mid C_{k})}\nwhere the evidence\n)\n{\\displaystyle Z=p(\\mathbf {x} )=\\sum _{k}p(C_{k})\\ p(\\mathbf {x} \\mid C_{k})}\nis a scaling factor dependent only on\nx\n1\n{\\displaystyle x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n}}\n, that is, a constant if the values of the feature variables are known.\nConstructing a classifier from the probability model[ edit ]\nThe discussion so far has derived the independent feature model, that is, the naive Bayes probability model .  The naive Bayes classifier combines this model with a decision rule .  One common rule is to pick the hypothesis that is most probable; this is known as the maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule.  The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier , is the function that assigns a class label\ny\nC\nk\ny\nargmax\nk\n1\n)\n.\n{\\displaystyle {\\hat {y}}={\\underset {k\\in \\{1,\\ldots ,K\\}}{\\operatorname {argmax} }}\\ p(C_{k})\\displaystyle \\prod _{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i}\\mid C_{k}).}\nParameter estimation and event models[ edit ]\nA class's prior may be calculated by assuming equiprobable classes (i.e., priors = 1 / (number of classes)), or by calculating an estimate for the class probability from the training set (i.e., (prior for a given class) = (number of samples in the class) / (total number of samples)). To estimate the parameters for a feature's distribution, one must assume a distribution or generate nonparametric models for the features from the training set. [12]\nThe assumptions on distributions of features are called the event model of the Naive Bayes classifier. For discrete features like the ones encountered in document classification (include spam filtering), multinomial and Bernoulli distributions are popular. These assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are often confused. [13] [14]\nGaussian naive Bayes[ edit ]\nWhen dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute,\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\n. We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of\nx\nx\n\u03c3\nk\n2\nx\n{\\displaystyle x}\nassociated with class Ck. Suppose we have collected some observation value\nv\nv\n, can be computed by plugging\nv\n\u03bc\nk\n2\n2\n\u03c3\nk\n2\n{\\displaystyle p(x=v\\mid C_{k})={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\pi \\sigma _{k}^{2}}}}\\,e^{-{\\frac {(v-\\mu _{k})^{2}}{2\\sigma _{k}^{2}}}}}\nAnother common technique for handling continuous values is to use binning to discretize the feature values, to obtain a new set of Bernoulli-distributed features; some literature in fact suggests that this is necessary to apply naive Bayes, but it is not, and the discretization may throw away discriminative information . [8]\nSometimes the distribution of class-conditional marginal densities is far from normal. In these cases, kernel density estimation can be used for a more realistic estimate of the marginal densities of each class. This method, which was introduced by John and Langley, [15] can boost the accuracy of the classifier considerably. [16] [17]\nMultinomial naive Bayes[ edit ]\n(\nwhere\np\ni\n{\\displaystyle p_{i}}\nis the probability that event i occurs (or K such multinomials in the multiclass case).  A feature vector\nx\nis then a histogram , with\nx\ni\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\ncounting the number of times event i was observed in a particular instance.  This is the event model typically used for document classification, with events representing the occurrence of a word in a single document (see bag of words assumption). The likelihood of observing a histogram x is given by\np\ni\np\nk\ni\nx\ni\n{\\displaystyle p(\\mathbf {x} \\mid C_{k})={\\frac {(\\sum _{i}x_{i})!}{\\prod _{i}x_{i}!}}\\prod _{i}{p_{ki}}^{x_{i}}}\nThe multinomial naive Bayes classifier becomes a linear classifier when expressed in log-space: [5]\nlog\np\ni\n1\nn\nx\ni\nlog\np\nk\ni\nb\nw\nk\nx\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\log p(C_{k}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )&\\varpropto \\log \\left(p(C_{k})\\prod _{i=1}^{n}{p_{ki}}^{x_{i}}\\right)\\\\&=\\log p(C_{k})+\\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\cdot \\log p_{ki}\\\\&=b+\\mathbf {w} _{k}^{\\top }\\mathbf {x} \\end{aligned}}}\nwhere\nb\nlog\np\nand\nw\nk\ni\nlog\np\nk\ni\n.\nIf a given class and feature value never occur together in the training data, then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, because the probability estimate is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of a feature's value. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, called pseudocount , in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is called Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one, and Lidstone smoothing in the general case.\nRennie et al. discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems, including the use of tf\u2013idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization, to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machines . [5]\nBernoulli naive Bayes[ edit ]\nIn the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent booleans (binary variables) describing inputs. Like the multinomial model, this model is popular for document classification tasks, [13] where binary term occurrence features are used rather than term frequencies. If\nx\ni\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\nis a boolean expressing the occurrence or absence of the i'th term from the vocabulary, then the likelihood of a document given a class\nC\nk\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(\\mathbf {x} \\mid C_{k})=\\prod _{i=1}^{n}p_{ki}^{x_{i}}(1-p_{ki})^{(1-x_{i})}}\nwhere\np\nk\ni\nC\nk\n{\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n. This event model is especially popular for classifying short texts. It has the benefit of explicitly modelling the absence of terms. Note that a naive Bayes classifier with a Bernoulli event model is not the same as a multinomial NB classifier with frequency counts truncated to one.\nSemi-supervised parameter estimation[ edit ]\nGiven a way to train a naive Bayes classifier from labeled data, it's possible to construct a semi-supervised training algorithm that can learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data by running the supervised learning algorithm in a loop: [18]\nGiven a collection\n{\\displaystyle D=L\\uplus U}\nof labeled samples L and unlabeled samples U, start by training a naive Bayes classifier on L.\nUntil convergence, do:\nPredict class probabilities\nD\n.\nRe-train the model based on the probabilities (not the labels) predicted in the previous step.\nConvergence is determined based on improvement to the model likelihood\nP\ndenotes the parameters of the naive Bayes model.\nThis training algorithm is an instance of the more general expectation\u2013maximization algorithm (EM): the prediction step inside the loop is the E-step of EM, while the re-training of naive Bayes is the M-step. The algorithm is formally justified by the assumption that the data are generated by a mixture model , and the components of this mixture model are exactly the classes of the classification problem. [18]\nDespite the fact that the far-reaching independence assumptions are often inaccurate, the naive Bayes classifier has several properties that make it surprisingly useful in practice. In particular, the decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one-dimensional distribution. This helps alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality , such as the need for data sets that scale exponentially with the number of features. While naive Bayes often fails to produce a good estimate for the correct class probabilities, [19] this may not be a requirement for many applications. For example, the naive Bayes classifier will make the correct MAP decision rule classification so long as the correct class is more probable than any other class. This is true regardless of whether the probability estimate is slightly, or even grossly inaccurate. In this manner, the overall classifier can be robust enough to ignore serious deficiencies in its underlying naive probability model. [6] Other reasons for the observed success of the naive Bayes classifier are discussed in the literature cited below.\nRelation to logistic regression[ edit ]\nThis section needs expansion.\n(August 2014)\nIn the case of discrete inputs (indicator or frequency features for discrete events), naive Bayes classifiers form a generative-discriminative pair with ( multinomial ) logistic regression classifiers: each naive Bayes classifier can be considered a way of fitting a probability model that optimizes the joint likelihood\np\n{\\displaystyle p(C,\\mathbf {x} )}\n, while logistic regression fits the same probability model to optimize the conditional\np\nC\n1\nexceed those of\n\". Expressing this in log-space gives:\nlog\np\n0\n{\\displaystyle \\log {\\frac {p(C_{1}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )}{p(C_{2}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )}}=\\log p(C_{1}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )-\\log p(C_{2}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )>0}\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the log-odds, or logit , the quantity predicted by the linear model that underlies logistic regression. Since naive Bayes is also a linear model for the two \"discrete\" event models, it can be reparametrised as a linear function\nb\nw\nx\n0\n{\\displaystyle b+\\mathbf {w} ^{\\top }x>0}\n. Obtaining the probabilities is then a matter of applying the logistic function to\nb\nw\nx\n, or in the multiclass case, the softmax function .\nDiscriminative classifiers have lower asymptotic error than generative ones; however, research by Ng and Jordan has shown that in some practical cases naive Bayes can outperform logistic regression because it reaches its asymptotic error faster. [20]\nProblem: classify whether a given person is a male or a female based on the measured features.\nThe features include height, weight, and foot size.\n150\n9\nThe classifier created from the training set using a Gaussian distribution assumption would be (given variances are unbiased sample variances ):\nPerson\n7.5\n1.6667\nLet's say we have equiprobable classes so P(male)= P(female) = 0.5.  This prior probability distribution might be based on our knowledge of frequencies in the larger population, or on frequency in the training set.\nBelow is a sample to be classified as male or female.\nPerson\nsample\n6\n130\n8\nWe wish to determine which posterior is greater, male or female. For the classification as male the posterior is given by\nposterior (male)\ne\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nc\ne\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{posterior (male)}}={\\frac {P({\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{height}}\\mid {\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{male}})}{evidence}}}\nFor the classification as female the posterior is given by\nposterior (female)\ne\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nc\ne\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{posterior (female)}}={\\frac {P({\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{height}}\\mid {\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{female}})}{evidence}}}\nThe evidence (also termed normalizing constant) may be calculated:\nevidence\nP\n)\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}{\\text{evidence}}=P({\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{height}}\\mid {\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{male}})\\,p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{male}})\\\\+P({\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{height}}\\mid {\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{female}})\\,p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{female}})\\end{aligned}}}\nHowever, given the sample, the evidence is a constant and thus scales both posteriors equally.  It therefore does not affect classification and can be ignored.  We now determine the probability distribution for the sex of the sample.\nP\np\n1.5789\n,\n{\\displaystyle \\sigma ^{2}=3.5033\\cdot 10^{-2}}\nare the parameters of normal distribution which have been previously determined from the training set. Note that a value greater than 1 is OK here \u2013 it is a probability density rather than a probability, because height is a continuous variable.\np\n5.9881\n10\n6\n{\\displaystyle p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{male}})={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\pi \\sigma ^{2}}}}\\exp \\left({\\frac {-(130-\\mu )^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}}\\right)=5.9881\\cdot 10^{-6}}\np\n1.3112\n10\n3\n{\\displaystyle p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{male}})={\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {2\\pi \\sigma ^{2}}}}\\exp \\left({\\frac {-(8-\\mu )^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}}\\right)=1.3112\\cdot 10^{-3}}\nposterior numerator (male)\n6.1984\n10\n9\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{posterior numerator (male)}}={\\text{their product}}=6.1984\\cdot 10^{-9}}\nP\np\n2.2346\n10\n1\n{\\displaystyle p({\\text{height}}\\mid {\\text{female}})=2.2346\\cdot 10^{-1}}\np\n1.6789\n10\n2\n{\\displaystyle p({\\text{weight}}\\mid {\\text{female}})=1.6789\\cdot 10^{-2}}\np\n2.8669\n10\n1\n{\\displaystyle p({\\text{foot size}}\\mid {\\text{female}})=2.8669\\cdot 10^{-1}}\nposterior numerator (female)\n5.3778\n10\n4\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{posterior numerator (female)}}={\\text{their product}}=5.3778\\cdot 10^{-4}}\nSince posterior numerator is greater in the female case, we predict the sample is female.\nHere is a worked example of naive Bayesian classification to the document classification problem.\nConsider the problem of classifying documents by their content, for example into spam and non-spam e-mails . Imagine that documents are drawn from a number of classes of documents which can be modeled as sets of words where the (independent) probability that the i-th word of a given document occurs in a document from class C can be written as\np\n{\\displaystyle p(w_{i}\\mid C)\\,}\n(For this treatment, we simplify things further by assuming that words are randomly distributed in the document - that is, words are not dependent on the length of the document, position within the document with relation to other words, or other document-context.)\nThen the probability that a given document D contains all of the words\nw\ni\np\n{\\displaystyle p(D\\mid C)=\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid C)\\,}\nThe question that we desire to answer is: \"what is the probability that a given document D belongs to a given class C?\" In other words, what is\np\nand\np\n{\\displaystyle p(C\\mid D)={p(D\\cap C) \\over p(D)}}\nBayes' theorem manipulates these into a statement of probability in terms of likelihood .\np\n{\\displaystyle p(C\\mid D)={\\frac {p(C)\\,p(D\\mid C)}{p(D)}}}\nAssume for the moment that there are only two mutually exclusive classes, S and \u00acS (e.g. spam and not spam), such that every element (email) is in either one or the other;\np\n{\\displaystyle p(D\\mid S)=\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid S)\\,}\nand\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(D\\mid \\neg S)=\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid \\neg S)\\,}\nUsing the Bayesian result above, we can write:\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(S\\mid D)={p(S) \\over p(D)}\\,\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid S)}\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle p(\\neg S\\mid D)={p(\\neg S) \\over p(D)}\\,\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid \\neg S)}\nDividing one by the other gives:\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle {p(S\\mid D) \\over p(\\neg S\\mid D)}={p(S)\\,\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid S) \\over p(\\neg S)\\,\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid \\neg S)}}\nWhich can be re-factored as:\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle {p(S\\mid D) \\over p(\\neg S\\mid D)}={p(S) \\over p(\\neg S)}\\,\\prod _{i}{p(w_{i}\\mid S) \\over p(w_{i}\\mid \\neg S)}}\nThus, the probability ratio p(S | D) / p(\u00acS | D) can be expressed in terms of a series of likelihood ratios .\nThe actual probability p(S | D) can be easily computed from log (p(S | D) / p(\u00acS | D)) based on the observation that p(S | D) + p(\u00acS | D) = 1.\nTaking the logarithm of all these ratios, we have:\nln\np\n)\n{\\displaystyle \\ln {p(S\\mid D) \\over p(\\neg S\\mid D)}=\\ln {p(S) \\over p(\\neg S)}+\\sum _{i}\\ln {p(w_{i}\\mid S) \\over p(w_{i}\\mid \\neg S)}}\n(This technique of \" log-likelihood ratios \" is a common technique in statistics.\nIn the case of two mutually exclusive alternatives (such as this example), the conversion of a log-likelihood ratio to a probability takes the form of a sigmoid curve : see logit for details.)\nFinally, the document can be classified as follows.  It is spam if\np\n(i. e.,\n0\n{\\displaystyle \\ln {p(S\\mid D) \\over p(\\neg S\\mid D)}>0}\n), otherwise it is not spam.\n(May 2009)\nCaruana, R.; Niculescu-Mizil, A. (2006).

We initialized the list and used it to add pieces of a jigsaw puzzle inside the list.\nThe user is to input the amount of rows and column they want the board to be. Each row is a new piece and each column is a new piece. Each piece is a list of 3 lists to look like a matrix. My idea was to create a list pieces=[] and append the list with each new generated piece.\nMy problem is that i can't get the str() to print the board out. I was thinking we should print the first list of the 3 lists of each piece in the pieces list and then for the middle list of the 3 lists and then the last list of the three lists. And start at a new line. I do know how to implement it though.\nOr I was thinking i could just print each piece alone and then add pieces to that string to print out the board. So i would not be using the pieces=[] list. I don't know which is best or how to implement them.\nI tried looking at other questions but I could not find an answer, I try to print the string representation of the class:\nfrom random import randint\nfrom pprint import pprint\n\n\nclass Jigsaw:\n\n    def __init__(self, r, c):\n        self.pieces = []\n        self.row = r\n        self.col = c\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Writes the state and value to a string.\n        \"\"\"\n        s =\" \"\n        d = \"\"\n        f = \"\"\n        g = \"\"\n        for row in self.pieces:\n        #print(row)\n            for col in row:\n               #print(col)\n                d = d +\" \"+ format(col[0])\n        print(d)\n        for row in self.pieces:\n            #print(row)\n            for col in row:\n            #print(col)\n                f = f +\" \" + format(col[1])\n        print(f)\n\n        for row in self.pieces:\n            #print(row)\n            for col in row:\n                #print(col)\n                g = g +\" \"+ format(col[2])\n        print(g)\n\n\n\n    #     return pce\n    # result = 'ball : %s' \\\n    #     % (pce)\n        #return r\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the string representation.\n        \"\"\"\n        return str(self)\n\n    def puzzle_board(self):\n        for c in range(self.row):\n            for d in range(self.col):\n                self.pieces.append(self.add_piece)\n\n        return self.pieces\n\n    def add_piece(self):\n        a = PieceGenerator()\n        b = self.a_piece(a.idn,a.top,a.left,a.right,a.bottom)\n        self.pieces.append(b)\n        return(b)\n\n\n    def mis(self):\n        self.add_piece()\n\n     # def boardShuffle(self,board):\n\n    def a_piece(self, id, top,left,right,bottom):\n        \"\"\"\n        Returns the piece values.\n        \"\"\"\n        pce = [[\" \", top, \" \"], [left, id, right], [\" \", bottom, \" \"]]\n        return(pce)\n\n    # def puzzleSolve(self,board):\n\nclass PieceGenerator:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates new puzzle pieces with their values.\n    \"\"\"\n    idn = 0 #Global variable to keep track of all the pieces\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        A piece have top, bottom, right, left values and puzzle piece it self\n        \"\"\"\n        self.top = randint(10,99)\n        self.bottom = randint(10,99)\n        self.right = randint(10,99)\n        self.left = randint(10,99)\n        PieceGenerator.idn += 1\n\nprint(Jigsaw(3,5).puzzle_board())\nHere is the error I get:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"C:/Users/HP/PycharmProjects/untitled/.idea/jigsaw.py\", line 102, in    <module>\n    print(Jigsaw(3,5).puzzle_board())\n   File \"C:/Users/HP/PycharmProjects/untitled/.idea/jigsaw.py\", line 56, in  __repr__\n    return str(self)\n   File \"C:/Users/HP/PycharmProjects/untitled/.idea/jigsaw.py\", line 22, in __str__\n    for col in row:\nTypeError: 'method' object is not iterable\nasked Feb 19 '16 at 16:10\n24911 gold badge33 silver badges1111 bronze badges\nPlease post a MCVE instead of your whole code. Also, always include the traceback so we can at least look at where the problem is happening. Though it should be clear from the error that you're not actually iterating on a list. Run the debugger and find out why it crashes. \u2013 Vincent Savard Feb 19 '16 at 16:15\n7\nYou misunderstand the error message: It doesn't say that a list would not be iterable, it says that a method isn't.\nWhat happens is that your pieces list doesn't contain pieces but references to the add_piece method because you forgot to call the method when you wanted to append its result in line 56.\nYou could have found this error even having less experience with exception types by invoking a debugger (pdb) just before the line that raises the error.\n4,00711 gold badge1111 silver badges1414 bronze badges\nSo I removed the rpr() method to see how it goes through the str() method, and it doesn't print the way I want it to. Do you happen to have an idea on how I could fix that? \u2013 Jessy White Feb 19 '16 at 16:24\nYou need to call add_piece.  add_piece(), not add_piece. \u2013 Max Feb 19 '16 at 16:28\nThanks that printed the list! But when I run Jigsaw(3,5) without calling puzzleboard, it doesn't go through the str method even after i changed the print to return, in the method. It returns nothing. \u2013 Jessy White Feb 19 '16 at 16:41\nThanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!\nPlease be sure to answer the question.

            "Where to Go Shopping in Melbourne: Guide to the Best Malls, Outlets, Arcades & Thrift\nIf shopping were an Olympic sport, I would have been awarded numerous gold medals throughout the years.\u201d ~ Alyse.\nSeeing as you\u2019re here, you\u2019re probably asking yourself where to go shopping in Melbourne? Having visited at least a dozen times over the years, I\u2019ve become quite acquainted with Australia\u2019s capital of culture and know exactly where to find what I\u2019m after. Sometimes in Melbourne I discover items easily that I have a hard time getting my hands on back home in Sydney!\nI can confirm the rumours you\u2019ve probably heard are true: Melbourne truly is a shopper\u2019s paradise. Although, this paradise may seem a little overwhelming to navigate at first if you aren\u2019t sure where to start or what to expect at each shopping destination. This is where my fictitious gold medals come in handy because I\u2019ve racked up many Melbourne shopping tips over the years that I\u2019m happy to share with you.\nTo help you make the most of your Melbourne shopping experience, I\u2019ve teamed up with AccorHotels to bring you this complete guide to shopping in Victoria\u2019s capital city. No need to scour the internet because here all the bases are covered!\nWith hotels dotted throughout the city, staying at an AccorHotel in Melbourne will allow you to be within reach of many shopping hotspots (especially at their brand new hotel right by Chadstone Shopping Centre!) This means you\u2019ll always have a room nearby to offload your purchases then continue on your way. Handy, right?\nIf you want to know where to go shopping in Melbourne for your own souvenirs, including the best malls, arcades, outlets, boutiques, markets, thrift stores and even cheap shopping, read on for more!\nThis guide to the best shopping in Melbourne will cover:\nShopping malls in Melbourne city & beyond\nOutlet shopping in Melbourne\nThrift stores, markets & cheap shopping in Melbourne\nSpecialty stores that deserve a mention\nExclusive Melbourne shopping tips\nComplete guide to where to go shopping in Melbourne\nDuring my younger years, I was quite the shopaholic! I would usually buy cheap clothes and buy them often. As I\u2019ve grown older, my approach to shopping has changed as I now have a more sustainable mindset (as I do with travel). Instead of shopping frequently now, I prefer to purchase pieces for my wardrobe that are higher quality, meaning they last longer, look better and I don\u2019t need to purchase as often.\nIn saying that, with many years of shopping experience under my belt I know exactly where the best shopping spots in Melbourne are to suit all budgets.\nFor each of the categories in my article below, I\u2019ll outline what you can expect at each shopping destination, their respective addresses and any extra tips for visiting. As Australia\u2019s fashion capital, souvenir shopping is one of the best things to do in Melbourne!\nShopping malls in Melbourne City & beyond\nAs mentioned in my personal Melbourne itinerary , much of the best shopping in Melbourne can be found on \u201cThe Grid\u201d \u2013 in the central business district (CBD). You may notice many of the historic buildings have references to Queen Victoria, the state\u2019s namesake. While there\u2019s a huge concentration of stores in Melbourne city, you\u2019ll also reap major rewards if you venture out into the suburbs, too!\nChadstone the Fashion Capital\n1341 Dandenong Road, Chadstone\nHave you even been shopping in Melbourne if you haven\u2019t visited Chaddy? As the largest shopping mall in the entire Southern Hemisphere, Chadstone Shopping Centre is an absolute must for anyone wishing to shop up a storm. It\u2019s arguably the best shopping centre in Melbourne and is my personal favourite place to shop. Despite the name, there\u2019s more than fashion to be found.\nThe high-end luxury fashion stores are very popular with international tourists, as are the mid-range fashion stores. No worries if you\u2019re after some more affordable options as well because it\u2019s all there. If you work up an appetite from all the walking, there are an almost endless number of food options to satisfy your hunger as well.\nOne of Chadtsone\u2019s greatest assets is the FREE tourist bus that takes you the 20-minute drive from the city\u2019s Federation Square directly to the mall. It\u2019s definitely worth taking advantage of because an Uber or taxi back to the city from Chadstone will set you back around AUD 30 \u2013 40 depending on the time of day.\nTIP: Make sure you book your spot on the free bus a day or so in advance if you can, as you\u2019d imagine the bus is quite popular so it\u2019s easy to miss out! Take a of screenshot the reservation on your phone to show the bus driver before you board.\nNOTE: If you get the free bus from the city before or at 9am, note that most of the stores at Chadstone don\u2019t open until 10am. You can use this time to grab some breakfast or plan which stores you want to visit first thing.\nA handful of stores allow Duty Free for tourists, too. More about duty free shopping in Melbourne towards the end of this guide.\nBourke Street Mall\n231 Victoria Road, Melbourne\nPerhaps one of the city\u2019s most famous areas and the main shopping street in Melbourne, Bourke Street Mall is an unmissable destination for visitors. Located between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets, this section of Bourke Street is pedestrian friendly (meaning no cars) but you\u2019ll need to keep an eye out for trams that occasionally run through the mall.\nWith stunning architecture lining the street, Bourke Street Mall is a picturesque shopping destination. It\u2019s great for exploring major department stores like David Jones, Myer and Target, as well as other Australian and international retailers. On the corner of Elizabeth Street is where you\u2019ll find Australia\u2019s first and largest H&M store, located within the grand old GPO Building.\n267 Lonsdale Street, Melbourne\nThe Melbourne Emporium is probably my favourite place to go shopping within Melbourne city. Its quirky interior and great eateries keep things interesting! There are over 220 retail stores, many fitting into the mid-range to high-end fashion and accessories bracket.\nWhile on a smaller scale, Melbourne Emporium features many of the stores you\u2019ll find at Chadstone if you don\u2019t have time to make the journey out there during your trip.\nThe District Docklands\n440 Docklands Drive, Docklands\nPreviously Harbour Town Docklands, The District is a good place to shop if you\u2019re after Australian souvenirs, some international high street brands and kids toys. Although it\u2019s located off Melbourne\u2019s grid, it\u2019s very easy to get to on Tram 86 from the CBD, taking around 20mins. Tram 86 is within the Free Tram Zone so there\u2019s no need to tap on and off with your Myki card.\nCollins Street\nCnr Collins Street & Exhibition Streets, Melbourne\nOne of the nicest Melbourne shopping spots, Collins Street has a lovely old-world charm kinda vibe. Its tree-lined footpaths feature some of the city\u2019s most iconic Victorian architecture, earning the eastern side the nickname \u201cParis End\u201d since the 1950\u2019s.\nNow known for flagship luxury designer stores, don\u2019t be surprised if you see a queue of people patiently waiting outside some of them (especially at Gucci and Louis Vuitton).\nThe place to be seen shopping for luxury designer goods, on Collins Street you\u2019ll find boutiques for Dior, Omega, Gucci, Botega Venetta, Dolce & Gabbana, Ralph Lauren, Max Mara, Mont Blanc, Bvlgari, Herm\u00e8s and more. Chanel is located just around the corner in Russell Street.\nTIP: Australia is one of the cheaper places in the world to purchase luxury designer goods and visitors know it! Begin shopping around opening time to avoid having to queue to get into these stores later in the afternoon.\nThe \u201cParis End\u201d of Collins Street\nCollins 234 Boutique Place\n234 Collins Street, Melbourne\nYep, another shopping spot on Collins Street! Collins 234 Boutique Place is home to a massive Dymocks bookstore, which are quite rare to find these days!\nIt also features a Dymocks stationery & giftware store where you\u2019ll find gifts even for the most discerning person. There\u2019s also a small selection of fashion retailers such as Saba, Mollini & Indigo.\nSt Collins Lane\n260 Collins Street, Melbourne\nBecause Collins Street itself isn\u2019t enough! St Collins Lane is one of Melbourne\u2019s smaller shopping malls but don\u2019t let that deter you. Featuring a decent range of retailers specialising in shoes and talented jewellers, you\u2019ll also find mid-range fashion stores such as Reiss, Review, Lacoste, Kookai, Cue, Rodd & Gunn and Furla.\nCrown Towers, 8 Whiteman Street, Melbourne\nIf you prefer to shop late into the night, head to the retail complex at Crown Casino. The opening hours are some of the best in Melbourne, with stores trading until 9pm. Some even extend their hours until midnight for a last-minute shopping fix!\nThe complex features high-end luxury brands such as Paspaley, Rolex, Prada, Bvlgari, Omega and Salvatore Ferragamo. There are some mid-range retail options, too such as Guess, Mimco, Peter Alexander, G-Star, Witchery and Politix.\nFor any casino lovers in your life, pick up some branded Crown merchandise in the dedicated Crown Casino Gift Store.\nMelbourne Central\nCnr La Trobe & Swanston Streets, Melbourne\nAccessible through the Melbourne Emporium, Melbourne Central mall features some quirky, lesser-known stores if you\u2019re into that type of thing. It\u2019s the place to shop if you\u2019re in the market for cheap to mid-range fashion and footwear, underwear and stationery. There\u2019s even a Hoyts cinema and Strike Bowling alley if shopping gets a little too much to bear!\nMelbourne Central is easily accessible from the Melbourne Emporium\nSouthgate\nRiverside Quay, 1 Southgate Avenue, Southbank\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t look like much from the outside, there are some interesting retailers within Southgate. Downies Coins & Collectables is where you can find some of the rarest Australian souvenirs in the form of historical coins, old banknotes, stamps and bullion \u2013 what perfect gifts! There\u2019s also stationery, books and homeware stores within the complex.\nThe Strand\n250 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne\nThis colourful rainbow shopping mall is a hard one to miss due to its prominent location beside the Melbourne Emporium and H&M GPO buildings.\nIf trendy fashion and lifestyle retailers are your thing, here you\u2019ll find a small selection of stores among the likes of Rag & Bone, Acne Studios, Cos, Desigual and Onitsuka Tiger. The ever-popular Dinosaur Designs jewellery is here, too!\n619 Doncaster Road, Doncaster\nNeeding no real introduction, Westfield Doncaster is what you\u2019ve come to expect from the Westfield behemoth brand. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Westfield Doncaster, it\u2019s basically a smaller version of Chadstone Shopping Centre.\nArmadale High Street\nBetween Glenferrie Road & Orrong Road, Armadale\nPerhaps you\u2019re planning a wedding? Armadale high street is perfect for anything bridal related! From gowns and formal wear to invitations and accessories, it\u2019s a must visit to buy all the goodies needed for your big day.\nArmadale High Street is also home to a selection of art galleries, antiques and unique collectible items.\nTo get there from Melbourne city, catch Tram 6 in the Glen Iris direction from Swanston Street. The journey is about 20 minutes and you\u2019ll need to tap on and off with your Myki card.\nOutlet shopping in Melbourne\nDo you love sales? These factory outlets showcase some of the best discount shopping in Melbourne. You\u2019ll always find a bargain and unlike other cities, you don\u2019t need to journey far!\nSpencer Street Outlet Centre\nLevel 1, 202 Spencer Street, Docklands (next to Southern Cross Station)\nSpencer Street Outlets are the only factory outlets on The Grid. It\u2019s great for heavily discounted shoes, homewares, luggage and sports apparel. Some noteworthy stores include TK Maxx, and Chemist Warehouse for fragrance, toiletries and beauty.\nIt\u2019s also fairly decent for mid-range fashion labels such as Forever New, Cue and Portmans. Additionally, Spencer Street Outlets also features stationery stores, handbags and an UGG Shop.\nTIP: Not shopping related, but when you\u2019re here don\u2019t forget to check out the view down Bourke Street to capture an iconic Melbourne tram photo!\nDFO South Wharf\n20 Convention Centre Place, South Wharf\nAlso known simply as DFO Melbourne, DFO Southwharf is the largest factory outlet centre within a stone\u2019s throw from Melbourne CBD. It\u2019s perfect if you\u2019re on the hunt for homewares, luggage, fashion & footwear, electronics, jewellery and toys.\nThis is my favourite of all the outlet centres in Melbourne, purely because of the huge variety. Be prepared to spend the better part of a day here if you want to see everything!\nThe massive DFO South Wharf\nDFO Essendon\nSmaller than its sibling in South Wharf, DFO Frankston has many of the same stores. If you had to choose between the two, South Wharf would be the way to go.\nCompared to DFO South Wharf, there are about 60 fewer stores at DFO Essendon compared to DFO South Wharf. DFO South Wharf also has a larger variety of discounted goods. It may be worth popping in to DFO Essendon if you\u2019re nearby and couldn\u2019t find what you were after at DFO South Wharf, but no need to feel bad if you don\u2019t get the time!\nArcades to go shopping in Melbourne\nThe Royal Arcade\n335 Bourke Street Mall, Melbourne\nOpened in 1870, The Royal Arcade is Melbourne\u2019s first arcade and the oldest surviving arcade in Australia \u2013 how cool is that?\nAs such a special piece of Melbourne\u2019s cultural heritage, The Royal Arcade is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. As with the Block Arcade, the Golden Mile Heritage Walk also guides visitors through here.\nAt the southern end of the arcade hangs the huge Gaunt\u2019s Clock. Two mythical figures on either side \u2013 Gog and Magog \u2013 have been striking the clock\u2019s chimes every hour since 1892 to alert visitors to the time. Today, a number of jewellers occupy the Renaissance Revival-style stores.\nTimeless beauty at the Royal Arcade\nThe Block Arcade\n282 Collins Street, Melbourne\nGorgeous mosaic flooring? Check. Glass-domed ceilings? Check. High-end boutiques and chocolatiers? Check. Ornate cornices and plasterwork? Check. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you were in Paris or Milan with the breathtaking details adorning The Block Arcade !\nThis stunning Victorian-era shopping arcade dates back to 1892 and is a beautiful place to metaphorically step back in time. It\u2019s best for boutique fashion, vintage jewellery, unique art and gift shops.\nMelbourne\u2019s Golden Mile Heritage Walk runs right through this amazing piece of architecture so even if you prefer to window shop, it\u2019s one of the must-see Melbourne shopping spots!\nStunning Block Arcade\nThe Walk Arcade\n309 \u2013 325 Bourke Street, Melbourne\nThis small arcade connects Little Collins Street to Bourke Street Mall. It\u2019s where you\u2019ll find some smaller retailers selling jewellery, accessories, gifts and homewares. It\u2019s also the place to go if you\u2019re hunting down popular Australian opals, duty free. Word on the street is the arcade will come under redevelopment in the future, so at least take a quick \u201cWalk through the Walk\u201d before it\u2019s gone!\nThrift stores, markets & cheap shopping in Melbourne\nSure, there\u2019s many of luxury stores to indulge in around Melbourne. But not everything has to have the luxury price tag to go with it! Below are some of the city\u2019s best second-hand thrift stores, markets and more to grab yourself a bargain.\nChapel Street\nCnr Chapel & High Streets, Prahan\nChapel Street is internationally recognised as home to the best thrift stores in Melbourne. The area is great for quirky little boutiques, second-hand luxury designer shops, bargain thrift stores and antique shopping.\nWhile the street itself stretches from St Kilda in the southern suburbs to South Yarra, much of the action happens around where High Street intersects it in Prahan. The most popular thrift stores in Melbourne are Chapel Street Bazaar, Eurotrash and Treasures of Prahan. Eurotrash and Treasures of Prahan stock authentic designer goods, some in vintage styles and others more recent. Many of the items available even include the original dust bags and packaging.\nTIP: Do your research online beforehand to scout out approximate prices and how to determine the authenticity of your favourite luxury items so you know you\u2019re getting a good deal.\nMoving on, I can\u2019t recommend Chapel Street Bazaar highly enough. It\u2019s like stepping into a gigantic time capsule; the collection is seriously impressive!\nThe owner was kind enough to allow me permission to take photos within the store to showcase a selection of what\u2019s available. This is definitely THE place to shop for unique, nostalgic gifts or if you need a costume for a fancy dress party.\nThere really is truth in the saying, \u201cOne man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure.\u201d\nChapel Street Bazaar Highlights: 1) Vintage watches, some from WWII era ~ 2) Antiques & homewares from decades gone ~ 3) Post-WWII kitchen items ~ 4) Records, 60\u2019s airline & other memorabilia ~ 5) Huge selection of vintage fashion & costumes ~ 6) Chapel Street Bazaar storefront\nQueen Victoria Market\nCnr Queen & Therry Streets, Melbourne\nDrum roll, please\u2026 Would you believe Queen Victoria Market has been operating since 1878? Boasting around seven hectares of stalls, it\u2019s the largest open-air market in the entire Southern Hemisphere (sensing a theme, here?) so it\u2019s one of the top places to see in Melbourne! There\u2019s a huge range of fresh food and Australian produce as well as a great mixture of clothing and accessories.\nSmall, guided tours are available to point out special icons throughout the markets and to sample the delicious food!\nFrom Melbourne city centre, it\u2019s easy to catch a tram up to Queen Victoria Market. Trams 19, 57, 58 and 59 will stop right outside the market and depart frequently.\nTIP: Beware, much of the fresh produce and specialty stands close at 2pm weekdays.\nArts Centre Melbourne Sunday Markets\nSt Kilda Road, Melbourne\nIf you venture south of Flinders Street Station and over Princes Bridge you\u2019ll come across these pop-up markets along St Kilda road. Over 80 local artisans have been carefully selected to showcase their unique hand-crafted items, making these markets perfect for picking up some authentic souvenirs or gifts!\nBrowse the range of beautiful items on display including art, fashion, jewellery, bags, beauty, food, homewares, stationery and even stuff for the kids. You can\u2019t miss it on your way to or from the National Gallery of Victoria.\nNOTE: Weather permitting, there is also live music from 12pm \u2013 3pm.\nSpecialty stores that deserve a mention\nObviously if I were to list all the specialty stores to go shopping in Melbourne, this article would be much longer than it is already! Below are two of my personal favourite specialty stores that I make sure to visit on each trip and I know my regular readers will find interesting (plus a duty-free option!)\nNGV Gift Store\n180 St Kilda Road, Melbourne\nIf you\u2019re an art lover like me, this isn\u2019t one to miss! The NGV gift store is loaded with an impressive range of unique souvenirs and gifts. During major exhibitions you can pick up quality related merchandise such as small homewares, jewellery, bags and accessories. I also love the extensive range of art-related books and have picked up quite a few over the years. Just make sure you leave enough room in your suitcase!\nDaiso\nMidtown Plaza, 204-246 Bourke Street, Melbourne\nTucked away beside the Telstra store is an escalator down to a huge hidden Daiso ! For my readers who love Japan as much as I do, here\u2019s where you\u2019ll be able to get your fix on many different kinds of Japanese goodies. I love stocking up on all kinds of varieties of items from Japan here.\nAs well as a massive range of food items from Japan, the store is full of useful items for around the home you didn\u2019t know you needed!\n185 Swanston Street, Melbourne\nDedicated specifically to duty free shopping, Lotte has a large range of electronics, fragrances, liquor, cosmetics and more. Show up with your passport to grab yourself a bargain or two.\nExclusive Melbourne shopping tips\nStay in a hotel located on Melbourne\u2019s Grid, preferably nearby central Bourke Street Mall. This makes it easy to free up your hands by dropping off bags in your room if they get too heavy. Save yourself the trouble of being weighed down with multiple bags!\nIf you\u2019re a keen shopper and know you\u2019ll be stocking up on a lot of clothing at the outlets, it\u2019s a good idea to bring an empty wheeled suitcase along. This will allow someplace to put all your shopping bags and wheel it around easily.\nIn addition to the above point, remember if you don\u2019t have a spare empty suitcase to bring along with you there\u2019s always stores to buy them at a discounted price.\nRe-energise at the many diverse food halls within the shopping malls. If you love authentic Japanese food, pay a visit to Gyoza Gyoza at the Melbourne Emporium for a snack during your shopping trip. They have the nicest gyoza outside of Japan I\u2019ve had and their ice cream options are incredible!\nIf you\u2019re an international visitor, a small handful of stores allow duty free shopping, especially at the outlet centres. Tullamarine Airport has duty free shopping, too. Simply ask and show your passport at the checkouts to receive a discount.\nConcluding the best places to go shopping in Melbourne\nCovering all the bases from shopping malls to factory outlets, historic arcades to thrift stores and more, I\u2019m quite confident in saying this guide to shopping in Melbourne could be one of the most comprehensive out there! I\u2019ve made sure to include various types stores to suit all budgets and hopefully you\u2019ll agree this guide will help you better plan your Melbourne shopping trip.\nSending a huge thanks to AccorHotels for making this article possible!\nNow you know all Melbourne shopping spots, where will you start?

Please note that measuring your body directly may provide misleading measurements.\nCHEST\nTo determine an accurate chest measurement, lay your measuring tool flat\naccroess the garments front, just under the arms.\nWAIST\nOur measurement chart provides the garment's natural waist dimension - this is the thinnest part of your mid-section. For a dress' waist measurement, find the thinnest part of the garment (the waistband) and measure it.

For pants and skirts, this is the measurement from the waist to the bottom hem.\nHIP\nMeasure the widest part of a skirt or pants, below the waistband, to determine fit.

            "Dec\n03\nDecember 03, 2019\nFirst created by Toast My Curry (TMC) in Perth, Western Australia, NAASTIES are a simple yet innovative food combination. And best of all, they don\u2019t exist anywhere else in the world \u2013 not even India.\nThe TMC team have combined elements from Mumbai and Indian street food, merging them with quintessential Indian curries to create NAASTIES \u2013 a wholesome, healthy street food that\u2019s sure to appeal to foodies from all walks of life.\nKim and Pankaj launched TMC in December 2015, having identified that Indian cuisine had been served in the same, conventional way for centuries, especially outside of India.\u00a0 Having seen the thousands of street food dishes available in India, they decided to combine the magic of Indian and Mumbai street food with what everyone already loved about Indian cuisine \u2013 CURRY.\u00a0 And so, the NAASTIE was born.\nKim and Panjak love home-style curries, so they decided to take inspiration from the delicious recipes cooked by their family and friends.\u00a0 Each curry on the menu reminds them of home and their loved ones, so they see their business venture as a simple yet effective way to share their love of good curry with the world.\nTMC operates as a food truck in and around Perth at markets, events, festivals and private gigs.\u00a0 You can also experience the NAASTIE at their very first bricks and mortar location in Yagan Square, Perth city.\nSo, the question bound to be on everyone\u2019s lips \u2013 just how do you \u2018do a NAASTIE\u2019? Here\u2019s our comprehensive guide:\nPick your favourite curry from the vegan, vegetarian and meat options available. These include butter chicken, lamb keema, mutton sukha, cauliflower curry and Bombay masala. Oh, and we can\u2019t forget to mention Nutella Tim-Tam (which, as you may have guessed, is not a curry!)\nChoose a plain or garlic naan.\nDecide which cheese and greens you\u2019d like to add.\nWait patiently as everything is toasted together to perfection. But it\u2019s not done just yet\u2026\nWatch as your NAASTIE is garnished with Indian crisps made from chickpea flour. This helps to add texture and crunch.\nEnjoy your NAASTIE with an alternative style of poppadum, corn salad sprinkled with Indian masala powder and a generous dollop of mango chutney.\nAside from serving up delicious street food, TMC also supports a worthwhile social cause, by co-ordinating the Curry4Curry project.\u00a0 So what does this actually mean? Well, for each NAASTIE sale, they donate a curry meal to support the education of street kids living in Mumbai.\u00a0 In their first four years of trading, TMC donated 40,000 curries, and they hope to make millions of donations as they grow their vision, lovingly referred to as CurryKarma.

            "Dec\n04\nWhy there\u2019s always a line at Singapore\u2019s best roast meat stall\nDecember 04, 2019\nWhen you see a line, get in it. That\u2019s what Singaporeans say about their hawker stall selections. At Stall No 71, located inside the famous Maxwell Hawker Center, there is always a line. When we arrived at Fu Shun Shao La Mian Jia, also known as Hock Soon Roasted Duck Rice And Noodles, around 5 p.m., there was a line snaking around the plastic chairs. It was so busy the chef had to shut his stall and stop operation for ten minutes.\nWe asked Rene Ng, our Urban Adventure Chinatown Food tour guide what was going on. He said they just got a take-out order for 50 people so we\u2019d have to wait to get our hands on some of Singapore\u2019s best Cantonese-style duck and suckling pork.\nThis Hong Kong Cantonese speciality is popular in hawker stalls throughout the city, but Chan Tuck Kwai\u2019s is famous. So famous that he\u2019s gained a dedicated customer base, including one man who drives 20-kilometres every day to eat his food.\nWhat makes suckling pork and duck so good? Chan Tuck Kwai focuses on quality rather than quantity. He sells about 30 ducks per day, and each one is roasted to perfection.\nFormerly an engineer, Chan Tuck Kwai quit his job to pursue his dream of owning a restaurant. His passion is evident in the energy inside his tiny stall and the taste of his dishes. It\u2019s become so popular through word of mouth that he had to hire an assistant to help meet demand. His assistant is known as Mr. Black, and he is known as Mr. White. They also wear the corresponding colour so no one gets them confused. But Chan Tuck Kwai is the only person who knows his secret recipe for the sauce that goes on the meat.\nWe watched as the red plastic bags filled with Styrofoam take out containers piled high onto one of the tables. Once the lights turned on and the stall opened again, we felt a shuffle of excitement in the line. It was no time before we had plates of pork and duck in front of us.\nNaturally, we wanted to try everything, so we got a plate of three. It came with juicy pork belly, called siu yok with crackling skin, soft barbecue suckling pork, known as char siu with a special blend of sweet soy sauce and prune sauce. And finally, the roasted duck, marinated with five spice and hung dry for two hours, so the skin becomes nice and crispy.\nDon't miss the best roast meat in Singapore at Chan Tuck Kwai. | Photo by Patrick Sgro\nIt was hard to choose a favourite among the three, but the flavor of the barbecue suckling pork was addictive while the soft meat and crackle of the duck was beyond satisfying. They\u2019re served with a side of vinegar sauce for dipping. You can also order any of them with rice or noodles covered in the special sauce. If you\u2019re really hungry you can buy a whole duck for between 45 and 55 SGD. It\u2019s so tasty we wouldn\u2019t blame you.\nHow to find it: As with any hawker centre in Singapore, follow the line. If you see a bright green sign with red Cantonese characters on it inside Maxwell Hawker Center, you know you\u2019re in the right place.\nWhat to order: The platter of three costs $15 and is a great way to try all Chan Tuck Kwai\u2019s specialties.\nWhen to go: The stall is open every day except Sundays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Whatever you do don\u2019t go during peak lunchtime, you\u2019ll be waiting a while.\nA Simple Guide to Thai Temple Etiquette\nThe Street Food 50 list for 2020 has arrived!\nLonely Planet Best in Travel 2020: What not to miss according to locals\nBest street food in Iceland: Baejarins Beztu Pylsur\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

            "Dec\n04\nDecember 04, 2019\nIt\u2019s a sweltering day in May, and the temperature in Penang is creeping past 30 degrees Celsius. Both locals and tourists are looking for a bit of reprieve, and they know Penang Road Famous Teochew Chendul is the place to find it. Chendol or chendul is Malaysia\u2019s favorite dessert, and this roadside stall turned empire is one of the best places to sample it.\nThis chendol favorite had humble beginnings starting in Penang in 1936, and today this third-generation stall has over 30 stores in Malaysia and Singapore. But for those in the know, their original spot is the best place for a bowl.\nWhat is chendol? Urban Adventures guide Farah Tan, describes it as, \u201cA sweet treat made of short green strips of dough which are naturally dyed from the juice of the pandan leaves that leaves a lovely fragrance and flavor. It is served in fresh coconut milk, sweetened by a mixture of brown sugar and palm sugar, topped up with stewed red beans and shaved ice.\u201d\nWe think the chendol from Penang Road Famous Teochew Chendul is the best in the city. | Photo by Patrick Sgro\nThere are many variations on this famous treat, but there are a few reasons Penang Road Famous Teochew Chendul is so special. Their rice pandan leaf juice is made of 100% pandan juice, and they only use good-quality, natural coconut milk. The red beans are high-quality and stewed with sugar for six hours to enhance the taste. For an added twist, their chendol strips are al dente instead of soft. Tan Chong Kim, the second-generation owner, likes to say that each ingredient is tasty on its own. Together, this mixture of creamy, crunchy, chewy texture and sweet ingredients creates a refreshing bowl reminiscent of light brown cereal milk.\nIt\u2019s rumored that when Chong Kim\u2019s father, Tan Teik Fuang, came to Penang from Southern China he learned the art of making chendol from an Indian man. According to Chong Kim, the dishes roots can be traced back to the Indian Muslim community of Malaysia. But Chong Kim\u2019s father wanted to give it a Nyonya, or Peranakan Chinese, flair with their firm chendol strips and flavorful, stewed red beans.\nToday the humble stall has upgraded from hand shaving their ice to using machines and the stall has become so famous from media and Instagram that it now takes up four shophouses near Penang Road. Tom Chong Kim is mostly retired, and his sons Tan Chin Ling and Tan Chin Hee now run the operation. But you\u2019ll still find him at the shop most days keeping a watchful eye over his staff.\nA bowl of delicious chendol. | Photo by Patrick Sgro\nOnce you\u2019ve braved the line and gotten your heaping bowl of chendol, head inside to one of the four shophouses and grab a plastic chair. You\u2019ll see dozens of pictures of celebrities posing with Chong Kim as well as a packed crowd of locals.\nDespite its name, Penang Road Famous Teochew Chendul also started specializing in the local favorite, Asam laksa and rojack in the 1990s and 2000s. But their best-seller is and will always be chendol.\nChong Kim doesn\u2019t know exactly how many blue bowls of chendol they serve up a day but estimates well over 1,000. At just 3.20 RM, about .75 USD, and 3.40 RM for take away, it\u2019s no wonder the line stretches down the street for this sugary delicacy at all hours of the day.\nHow to find it: Follow the line located at Keng Kwee Street, off Penang Road.\nWhat to order: Simply say \u201cone bowl please\u201d.\nWhen to go: It is open everyday from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. The line is unpredictable but is usually at its longest in the afternoon, especially during the weekends or school breaks.\nTastes & Traditions Tour\nA Simple Guide to Thai Temple Etiquette\nThe Street Food 50 list for 2020 has arrived!\nLonely Planet Best in Travel 2020: What not to miss according to locals\nBest street food in Iceland: Baejarins Beztu Pylsur\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

            "Dec\n05\nDecember 05, 2019\nIn the old times \u2013 long before fridges existed \u2013 Spanish bars came up with an ingeniously strong and tasty marinade that was used to help preserve fish and/or mask the flavour of the fish if it had gone slightly bad. Known as adobo sevillano (or marinated fried dogfish), today\u00a0 it\u2019s one of Seville\u2019s most popular bar snacks. When ordered as a takeaway option, it\u2019s usually served in bite-size chinks on a big piece of paper, rolled into a cone.\nFreidur\u00eda Reina Victoria has been frying fish in Seville for nearly 5 decades. The family is originally from Galicia \u2013 Spain\u2019s most highly regarded fish-cooking region and the join is always packed with enthusiastic locals who know good food when they taste it.\nAn unassuming exterior hides Seville's best street food at Freidur\u00eda Reina Victoria. | Photo by Seville Urban Adventures\nThe dish is usually made using dogfish, but sometimes they serve different versions. It\u2019s then combined with Jerez sherry vinegar, garlic, sweet paprika, oregano, cumin, bay leaf salt, flour for frying and olive oil, then it\u2019s gently fried. The taste is slightly sour, slightly salty and the texture is soft and juicy.

            "Jan\n08\nJanuary 08, 2020\nIt\u2019s late night in Reykjavik. Or is it morning? I can\u2019t tell, as I\u2019ve been out drinking Icelandic craft beers under the midnight sun, when dusk turns to dawn without darkness ever coming in between. Even though it\u2019s June, there\u2019s a cold wind whipping off the north Atlantic to where I\u2019m standing \u2013 in line at a simple metal shack near the harbour, hungry for Iceland\u2019s most famous snack.\nNo, I\u2019m not talking about fermented shark. I\u2019m here for a hot dog.\nThere is a line-up at Baejarins Beztu Pylsur any time of day, although the after-bar period is particularly popular. Nothing cures a bit too much booze like street food, after all, and the stall kindly stays open until 2am on weekdays and 4:30am on weekends to serve those, like me, who have been out until morning partaking in Reykjavik\u2019s famous nightlife.\nThe line-up is a mix of locals and tourists alike. The place is as famous among the Icelandic community (it\u2019s been open since 1937), as it is with travellers who have read it about it in every guidebook and blog post about Reykjavik.\nBill Clinton has eaten here. So have Metallica and Kim Kardashian (not together). Ben Stiller grabbed one while he was in town filming The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It\u2019s been featured on Anthony Bourdain\u2019s No Reservations. In 2006, The Guardian named it home to the best hot dog in Europe. But why would something as simple as sausage on a bun be such a foodie attraction? And why, of all places, here on the edge of the Arctic Circle?\nIs this the best hot dog in Europe? The Guardian seem to think so. | Photo by Jerick Perrone\nWell, turns out that the location may be part of its appeal. The hot dogs are made primarily from lamb, which makes sense when you think about the fact there are some 800,000 sheep in Iceland \u2013 and only 320,000 people. Icelandic lamb is free-range organic and hormone-free, so the meat is far higher quality than you might expect from your typical \u201cstreet meat\u201d stall. The all-natural casing gives the hot dogs a satisfying snap, and their small size means you can easily eat two (trust me, order a second). These aren\u2019t the jumbo foot-longs you find at American ball parks.\nThe fixings are quite different from your typical hot dog, too \u2013 don\u2019t expect to find any relish or hot mustard on the counter. Instead, if you want to eat it the way the locals do, you order it \u201ceina me\u00f0 \u00f6llu\u201c or \u201cone with everything\u201d: sweet ketchup that\u2019s made from apple sugar, sweet mustard that is an admittedly off-putting brown colour, remoulade (a sweet, mayo-based dressing), and to counter all that sweetness, a mix of raw and crispy fried onions.\nBaejarins Beztu isn\u2019t the only hot dog stand in town. In fact, hot dogs can be found all over Iceland, and in a country where food prices can break your travel wallet, they make for an affordable option (about 300 ISK or 2.50 USD). They\u2019re also mega convenient as you\u2019re driving the Ring Road or even in transit at Keflavik Airport \u2013 every gas station sells them and you can grab one in the terminal to snack on at your gate. But if you\u2019re about tradition, you need to go to the original hot dog stand that\u2019s been in operation and family-owned for over 80 years. You\u2019ll find it on Tryggvagata, not far from the Harpa Concert Hall. Just look for the line of people, any time of day. If I\u2019m in town, I\u2019ll be there, too.\nBest. Day.

            "Dec\n04\nStep back in time for a 1,000 year old Japanese sweet treat\nDecember 04, 2019\nAt Itakuraya , a small shop in Tokyo, black and white family photos and awards hang across from a counter covered in ningyoyaki. Ningyoyaki, also spelled ningyo-yaki, is one of Japan\u2019s most popular sugary treats. Made from a sponge cake, it has a sweet surprise in the middle\u2014red bean paste.\nFor over 100 years, the Fujii family has been perfecting their recipe for ningyoyaki. Today, the fourth generation owner Yoshito sits cross-legged in the back rhythmically spooning batter into cast-iron Shichifukujin molds and squeezing red bean paste called azuki inside. Below him is a gas-burning fire, crisping the cakes to perfection.\nShichifukujin are Japan\u2019s seven lucky gods, the god of money, happiness, beauty, longevity, success, cleverness, and development, the only Japanese god. But as Itakuraya, they don\u2019t make the god of happiness; instead the seventh god is your smile.\nThe Fujii family's little ningyoyaki shop in Tokyo. | Photo by Patrick Sgro\nMuch like the snack, the shop is like something out of Edo-era Japan. It\u2019s old school and unpretentious, yet known for serving up some of the best ningyoyaki in Tokyo. It\u2019s not a traditional street food in the sense that it isn\u2019t physically made on the street, something hard to find in Japan, especially Tokyo. Japanese culture prioritizes respect and cleanliness and discourages eating while walking or making a mess on the street. So this little shop tucked in off the street is the closest you\u2019ll get to a street food stand.\nWhat makes this simple snack stand out? The dough is made of high-quality honey, flour, egg, condensed milk and rice wine. The red sweet beans are from Tokage, in Hokkaido and mixed with sugar and water. Plus, they\u2019ve been working on their recipe for over 100 years. But Yoshito has a more humble reasoning for their popularity. \u201cThe people appreciate that the neighborhood is named Ningyocho, which is similar to ningyoyaki so people like the similarity,\u201d he says.\nCheck out Urban Adventures\u2019 Made in Japan Shopping tour, where you can visit Itakuraya and sample ningyoyaki for yourself:\nDuring our Urban Adventures Made in Japan Shopping tour visit, we\u2019re invited past the noren, or the curtain door, to watch Yoshito make the popular snack. His motions are repetitive but elegant, something that comes with many days and hours of practice. Yoshito jokes that when he first started, he burned them more than three times a day, but after three years he got used to it.\nAdding the all important filling to the ningyoyaki. | Photo by Patrick Sgro\nAfter he scoops in the batter with a special spoon, Yoshito brushes off the scraps of sponge cake with a unique brush and shuts the specially iron carved stamps. Yoshito smiles and says the molds are very heavy, and like the recipe, they\u2019re over 100-years-old.\nOnce he\u2019s satisfied with the cook time, they\u2019re ready to eat. We\u2019re handed individually wrapped bites and asked which god we got as soon as we slip them out of the bag. I got the god of beauty. As I bit into the soft dough, I was surprised at how sweet it was. Although I\u2019m not usually a red bean fan, the texture of the paste was a nice contrast against the fluffy warm dough. A word of warning, the paste is hot, so be careful not to burn your tongue.\nThis treat is especially popular in winter around the holiday season. During their busiest times, they work 14 hours, beat 300 eggs and sell 2,000 ningyoyaki a day. One costs 100 yen and can be eaten up to three days after baking. Many people opt for a box of five, ten, or even 15 so that no matter what, all the gods are on their side.\nHow to find it: It\u2019s a quick one-minute walk from Ningyo-cho Station on the Hibiya Line.\nWhat to order: A box of five or ten. These little snacks are addictive.\nWhen to go: They are open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. or until they\u2019re sold out.\nA Simple Guide to Thai Temple Etiquette\nThe Street Food 50 list for 2020 has arrived!\nLonely Planet Best in Travel 2020: What not to miss according to locals\nBest street food in Iceland: Baejarins Beztu Pylsur\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

            "Mar\n26\nMarch 26, 2020\nVegan Food in the City Centre\nGet your vegan junk food fix at Lord of the Fries in the city centre | Photo credit: Lord of the Fries\nIf you\u2019re coming to Melbourne for the first time, you\u2019ll probably find yourself hungrily making your way from the Airport to the Southern Cross Station skybus terminal, eyes darting around for something more enthralling than reading the fine print ingredients of local potato chip brands in a vending machine. Like all the best things in Melbourne, you\u2019ll find all you need hiding in plain site.\nOn the councourse of the station, an unnassuming fast food joint called Lord Of The Fries serves local commuters burgers and fries. Look a bit closer at the menu and you\u2019ll realise, hidden behind \u201cChick\u2019n\u201d \u201cBeef\u201d and \u201cPhish\u201d burgers is a 100% vegan menu! With over 15 locations across the city, the franchise, started in Melbourne in 2004, is a pefect example of the ways Melbournians have embraced vegan into the everyday fabric of our city. Try the Fakin\u2019 bacon BLT for breakfast, or end a night out in Melbourne like a local at 4-5am (we party late) with a nugget+ fries munch box.\nMake your way into the heart of the city and the vegan credentials get even better. The Causeway (a laneway between Bourke and Lt Collins St) has become a vegan hub, with Melbourne institution Crossways offering an all you can eat buffet of South Asian inspired dishes for $8.95 AUD. Futher down the lane, keep your eyes peeled for Union Kiosk , a typically tiny Melbourne cafe with an all vegan menu and twists on the classic Australian jaffle (toasted sandwich). Try the \u2018pulled jackfruit and japaleno\u2019 or stick with a classic cheese and tomato to go alongside your almond-milk flat white. Keep walking up stairs and looking down laneways in the city and you\u2019ll be spoilt for choice.\nHere are a few more worthwhile options.\nWeirdoughs : An all vegan dessert shop with fun pastel colours, creative gelato flavours like Aperol Spritz, and vegan \u2018butter\u2019 croissants that you won\u2019t believe aren\u2019t made using real butter.\nGopals Pure Vegetarian : Up a flight of stairs you\u2019ll find Gopals, with a winning vegan lasagne and subtle Hare Krishna message.\nGon De Lin : A non-descript lift up to level 1 will take you into an all vegan restaraunt where it\u2019s not uncommon to be eating mock-meat sweet and sour pork and spring onion pancakes with hipsters on one side and Buddhist monks on the other. Pro-tip: the lift keeps going up to one of the Urban Adventure teams\u2019 favourite rooftop bars, Goldilocks, where you can order food from below to be eaten at the bar.\nJungle Juice : While not strictly vegan, like many Melbourne cafes, Jungle Juice has embraced vegan options. Order a Vegan Crunch bagel (corn chips and siracha in a bagel!) and Qishr (Yemenese espresso with ginger) and feel right at home with your non-vegan friends.\nVegan Food in Fitzroy\nVegie Bar in Fitzroy has you fixed for meatless meals | Photo credit: Vegie Bar\nIf you think Melbourne\u2019s city centre is vegan paradise, you\u2019ll be blown away in Fitzroy, Melbourne\u2019s oldest and most hipster suburb. Amongst the heritage terrace houses and street art murals, Fitzroy has some of the world\u2019s best vegan food around every corner.\nVegie Bar : This was one of the first kids on the block serving up generous plates of pasta, burgers, nachos and pizza to hungry vegetarians for over 25 years. If you can\u2019t find a spot in the always busy restaurant, console yourself next door at their new sister store Girls & Boys over a tub of plant-based ice cream or a vegan smoothie.\nMadame K : This spot is home to a fresh all vegetarian Malay-Thai menu, while a little further down you\u2019ll find Afghan Gallery, which easily incorporates vegan options into it\u2019s beautiful Afghan menu.\nSmith and Daughters : Recently voted the 3rd best vegan restaurant in the world, one bite of Shannon Martinez\u2019s cooking will convince you why. The casual evening restaurant with a vegan take on Spanish and Italian dishes is a must do while you\u2019re in Melbourne, especially if the vegan prawn paella is back on the menu. Any meat eating friends you drag along might just leave converted, as head chef Shannon is herself still not vegetarian, so really pushes the menu to be as close to the taste of real meat as possible.\nSmith and Deli : Close to Smith and Daughters, this companion spot serves mouth watering vegan takes on american deli bagels and sandwiches, as well as products to bring home alongside a copy of the Smith and Deli Cookbook so you can explore it\u2019s secrets back in your own kitchen. Grab a \u2018tuna\u2019 sandwich and vegan doughnut to enjoy on the steps of the Fitzroy Town Hall as hipsters with designer dogs ride past.\nVegan Food in Pubs\nEven pub food can be vegan in Melbourne | Photo credit: Green Man's Arms\nBy now you\u2019ve had a full day or more of vegan treats and shopping, and are starting to feel like a true local Melbournian, so what better way to be a local than to retire to a neighbourhood pub. Long gone are the days when the classic Aussie pub menu consisted of little more than beef pies and surf and steak plates, as many of Melbourne\u2019s best pubs serve up something for everyone.\nGreen Man\u2019s Arms : A great pub to sit and watch the world over a pint of beer and house made falafels. This Carlton corner pub was recently transformed with cosy vintage decor, a warm fireplace, a great craft beer tap selection, and an Israeli inspired vegetarian menu.\nYarra Hotel : An old world Abbotsford pub with dog friendly beer garden, footy on the TV, and vegan options for everything on the menu.\nCornish Arms Hotel : This is where it all started for many former meat-eaters. This Brunswick watering hole with an entire vegan menu serves up all the classic aussie pub meals with a mock-meat twist. Put the \u2018Chicken\u2019 Parma or \u2018Fish\u2019 and Chips in front of a meat eating mate and they\u2019ll be easily fooled.\nThe Tote : The vegan food at the tote is a lot like the iconic venue itself: greasy, DIY, loud, and open well into the morning. Try the vegan gravy and chips once you\u2019re done moshing in the band room downstairs.\nVegan Shopping in Melbourne\nThe Cruelty Free Shop is a vegan shopper's paradise | Photo credit: Cruelty Free Shop\nWhen The Cruelty Free Shop (124 Johnston Street) opened in 2017 in Fitzroy, it was said to be the world\u2019s biggest vegan shop, and it\u2019s easy to see why with a massive selection of vegan foods, homeware, gifts, and ethical health and beauty products.\nVegan Style (345 Brunswick Street) is where to go for a new pair of shoes, all vegan and cruelty-free. They offer stylish footwear for men, women, and kids, as well as handbags.\nBooking an Urban Adventure in Melbourne and looking for a vegan twist?

            "Mar\n26\nMarch 26, 2020\nLocal Foods\nThere are a wide variety of vegan dishes to be found in Delhi, many of them on offer at street food stalls and carts, as well as in restaurants. But no matter what you\u2019re ordering, be it from a food stall or a sit-down restaurant, always ask before you commit, to ensure that there are no sneaky dairy or other non-vegan ingredients to watch out for.\nFor starters, dosas, originating from the Indian subcontinent, are similar to a crepe in appearance. The main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but the dish is now popular all over India. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambar, a stuffing of potatoes, and chutney.\nA Masala dosa is a South Indian food wherein the dough is made of fermented rice and lentils, and the stuffing is prepared with potatoes. No animal products go into the making of this dish, making it suitable for vegans.\nDosas are easy to find in Delhi and make a good vegan option | Photo credit: Pixabay\nBhelpuri is a popular street food snack all over India made with puffed rice, vegetables, and tamarind sauce. The crunchy, tangy dish makes for a great between-meal pick-me-up or just a simple snack to enjoy on the go.\nVegetable biryani is a fried rice dish made with an array of spices including nutmeg, cloves, coriander and mint, making for a savoury, fragrant plate of food. Just note that vegan travellers should ask for this dish to be made with oil rather than ghee.\nAloo gobi is a dry curry dish made with potatoes and cauliflower. The dish is flavoured with curry leaves and turmeric, giving it a golden yellow hue. Note that if the dish is served with a chapati, ask for no butter.\nPakoras are a tasty and addictive Indian snack that can usually be found in vegan form. The fritter-like dish is made with vegetables (and sometimes meat, so ask before you order), dipped in chickpea flour batter and deep fried. These tasty treats can be found at many street food stalls and markets, but just me sure to check they are meat and dairy-free before you dive in.\nBhutta is basically roasted corn on the cob, a popular summertime snack that can be found at many street food stalls for a healthy, vegan snack.\nVada pav is another street food staple that is often vegan and consists of a spicy potato patty sandwiched between pillowy bread. You\u2019ll just need to ensure no milk solids went into either the bread or the potato patty.\nOur Favourite Vegan Restaurants\nRose Caf\u00e9\nThe quaint Rose Cafe has an entire section of their menu dedicated to vegan dishes. Choose from salads (pumpkin or beetroot), open-face sandwiches, pasta, vegetarian shepherd\u2019s pie and a bunch of desserts including vegan banana cake, apple cake and everyone\u2019s favorite: dark chocolate gelato. The average price for one is around INR 500.\n264, Westend Marg, Saiyad Ul Ajaib Extension, Sainik Farm, New Delhi\nSmoke House Deli\nThis popular spot recently launched a healthy menu made up of organic ingredients and superfoods. The menu here has several options for vegans, including soy-marinated tofu, spinach and millet soup, and quinoa salad \u2013 all good options for vegan travellers. They also have a selection of grab-and-go items. You can expect to pay around INR 800.\n17, 1st Floor, Khan Market, New Delhi\nBurma Burma\nThis is a restaurant in Delhi that has an entirely vegetarian menu (with many vegan options). And the food is so good that you\u2019ll legit forget about your chicken tikkas and mutton biryanis for some time. They also serve great bubble tea, which is actually one of the many reasons we keep going back to this restaurant. The average price for one is INR 900.\nSelect Citywalk, 2nd Floor, S-25, Saket, New Delhi\nGet your fill of Asian vegan goodies at Burma Burma | Photo credit: Delhi Urban Adventures\nGreenr Caf\u00e9\nThis place has to be the one restaurant that probably has the most vegan options on their menu. Even if there are things on their menu that aren\u2019t vegan originally (like pizza), they offer vegan alternatives for an extra charge. You can expect to pay around INR 650 for one.\nMR House, 4, Basant Lok Community Centre, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi\nGetafix Caf\u00e9\nThose who love eating healthy swear by the food at Getafix , and no healthy menu is complete without vegan options. They offer vegan substitutes for their (delicious) smoothies, and the staff even makes a conscious effort to reduce the waste as much as possible (probably why you won\u2019t be given straws at this restaurant). The average price for one is INR 600.\nM-15, 1st Floor, Greater Kailash 1, New Delhi\nNote that you can also get takeaway dishes at all of the establishments listed above if you\u2019d rather take your vegan goodies to go.\nVegan Shopping in Delhi\nAlthough India does not have any specific supermarkets that are specifically vegan, India is mostly known for its vegetarian food, meaning you can easily find vegan-friendly products at every market. Items like almond milk, olive oil, fresh produce, tofu and organic items are usually on offer. But when in doubt, ask before you buy.\nRELATED POSTS\nPhiladelphia Wellness Guide: Healthy Eating, Exercise Options and More\nPrague Wellness Guide: Healthy Eating, Spas, Exercise Options and More\nA Simple Guide to Thai Temple Etiquette\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

            "We have been lucky enough to spend more than a decade exploring the reefs of South East Asia and have come to love the Philippines, for its people, top side natural beauty and beautiful reefs and marine life.\nHere are a few of our best places to snorkel in the Philippines:\nCabilao:\nWe love to snorkel around this island. A small island in the Visays, near Bohol, Cabilao has some of the healthiest reefs in the country with an abundance of hard and soft coral gardens alive with schooling reef fish, turtles, and small critters. Cabilao itself has some wonderful seaside resorts and picturesque beaches to relax on between snorkel sessions.\nAnda- Bohol\nTucked in the far quite corner of Bohol island is a beautiful bay called Anda. Here there is a long (14km) fringing reef which is home to all manner of marine creature ranging from the occasional whaleshark, to small seahorses, frog fish, eels, turtles and giant clams, to name but a few. This part of Bohol is reletively quiet and hosts fewer tourists than some other parts of the island and we think it makes a great snorkel vacation destination.\nMoalboal- Cebu\nThis coastal town offers amazing snorkeling opportunities. Our favorite is the chance to snorkel in a huge school of sardines. Watching these beauties move in their synchronized schoals is somethign truly special. Also a good chance to see jacks and trevally hunting the sardines. In the area there are also beautiful reefs, a good chance of seeing whitetip reef sharks and a host of tropical reef fish.\nCoron- North Palawan\nKnown for it\u2019s wrecks, esecially amongst wreck divers, Coron is a beautiful snorkel destinations. The fringing reefs are exceptionally healthy and colourful and offer the oppetunity to snorkel over shallow boat and plane wrecks form WWII. Also some beaches here are spectacualr. There is also a rare and beautiful lake, known as Barracuda Lake, which offers a sensory experience found almost no where else. The water in the lake is crystal clear, and whole there is little fish life int he lake, we love it because it has a thermicaline about 8m deep. Above the 8m mark the water in a cool 28C and below this it suddenly rises to over 38C. Such a wonderful thing to experience on a quick duck-dive.\n2 Comments On Our best places to snorkel in Philippines\nSandy\nDavid Wilkinson\nLeave a Reply\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nEmail address:\nContact\nPhone:\nAddress:\n"

            "by Billye Timbes\n(Portland OR USA)\nHas anyone snorkeled in the Philippines? What are the best places for snorkeling from the beach? What are the best boat snorkel trips? Thanks for any info you can share.\nComments for Has Anyone Snorkeled In The Philippines?\nby: Reg Rodriguez\nThe province of Palawan is a short flight from Manila. Most visitors there fly into Puerto Princessa, but I recommend flying into Coron on the island of Busuanga (50 min flight!) because it is more pristine and most importantly, there are many snorkeling and diving spots there! The area is also a hotspot for WWII shipwrecks if that is your thing.\nStay in one of the resorts in Coron or elsewhere along the shore of the island, and take excursions out to the myriad little islands, shipwrecks, and reefs in the area.\nI stayed at the Alam Indah Beach Resort, a tiny place with only two guesthouses that is about an hour drive from Coron (and far away from most tourists).\nEvery day I rented a small boat, which included the captain and lunch. All day long, we visited tiny islands and sites where I could snorkel. In some places, I was the only tourist for hours (or period). Many of the islands are small and surrounded by reefs, so you can just circle the entire island. In this area I saw the biggest clams I have ever seen (many bigger than me)!\nI highly recommend a visit to Busuanga if you have the time.\nI also hear that you can take snorkeling live-on boat trips from Coron to Puerto Princessa and vice-versa, but I have yet to try this.\nOct 02, 2016\nby: rosebd8\nWe went in 2012 and stayed at Apulit Island and Miniloc Island Resorts, both within El Nido Marine Reserve in Northern Palawan area. They both have great house reefs and nearby snorkeling. The boat snorkeling was excellent at both places too.\nClub Paradise Dimakya Island, Palawan is on a private island and the snorkeling circumnavigates it. The night snorkeling just off the resort front was fantastic and all around the island was quite excellent too. We went out on boats looking for dugongs two days but saw none. The boat snorkeling was fair.\nAll three of above resorts have boats that go out. The shore snorkeling at Club Paradise was much better than the boat snorkeling. Donsol was a waste of time for us. There were too many people and too few whale sharks. There is muck snorkeling by boat and it was okay but not particularly good.\nOct 03, 2016\nby: Snorkeling Homebodies\nThe Philippines has some of the healthiest reefs we have seen. Hard and soft corals, anemones  guarded by anemone fish, turtles, razorfish, sea snakes, giant clams, mandarinfish, and a lot I'm sure we missed.\nAs mentioned, Coron is a great destination, low rise, friendly, and local. Filipinos vacation there. Coron Town was inexpensive, with good hotel options, and no problem getting 6 person boat tours for the day, making several stops.\nOur other favorite spot was the Dauin area of Negros Oriental, near Dumaguete. This is where I got to see a mandarinfish, though admittedly, on a shallow one tank dive, at dusk.\nApo Island is a short day trip from this area. We splurged on our hotel but there are inexpensive options, and it is 20 min by Jeepney to Dumaguete.\nWe plan to return to explore more of the Philippines. Enjoy!\nOct 04, 2016\nby: Clare A.\nYes, I've snorkeled in the Philippines and after living on the Big Island for 6 years, Ao Nang/Krabi Thailand for 2 years, and visiting multiple other sites like Palau and Roatan, I still consider my snorkel experience in the Philippines to be one of the most beautiful ever.\nThere is a resort off the coast of Cebu island called Plantation Bay Resort. Pay about $20 to spend the day at the resort and they'll take you out to the reef on their boat. I'm talking about the absolutely most colorful reef and creatures I've ever seen. Giant Clams about 8-10 feet down that you can stick your hand in and they'll \"capture\" your hand (it's like being squeezed between two watery pillows, a delightful experience).\nOther top spots in the Philippines:\nNalusuan Island - Cebu\nSiete Pecadoes - Coron, Palawan\nBalicasag Island - off Bohol\nI also hear Siquijor - Off Dumaguete is a vast and beautiful marine sanctuary, but I haven't been there.\nEnjoy!\nby: Anonymous\nI have been snorkeling in the Florida Keys, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Thailand, and the Philippines. Coron in the Philippines has been the best.\nMar 04, 2017\nby: Anonymous\nEl Nido, Palawan, though a long ride to get to, has the best snorkeling I've seen in the Philippines. I've been to many Philippine islands and admit I might have missed places.\nBut for ease and beauty, spending the day in a small boat going to many small islands has been the best for me.\nI've seen the turtles in Apo Island, Negros, Oriental, Batanes, Cebu, Leyte, and I love Palawan. Coron is an easy flight from Manila, I recommend this also.\nApr 04, 2017\nby: Steve Hugel\nHave been to Bicol 15 times now and the best snorkeling (so far) has been in Caramoan the one time I was there. You'll have to take a boat to the port and get jeepney, tricycle or motorcycle transportation from there. Less trash there than other places I've snorkeled and plenty of marine life.\nAnother good spot is Daruanak Island south of Pasacao which is west of Naga. I believe it's a volcano core, and takes a 10 minute bangka boat trip from the beach resorts south of Pasacao. We always stay at Maria Maruja Resort there. Nice place to stay/snorkel. Still researching there so don't know all the spots.\nHope this helps.\nJun 27, 2017\nSnorkeling the Philippines\nby: Jeff B.....California\nI've been living here 3 years and done much snorkeling throughout most of the western visayas, Palawan, El Nido. You can just take the tour; A or C are the best. They will take you to 5 plus sites every day plus a lunch for under $30.\nCoron is the same. You can stay at a budget hotel and schedule a couple of their tours for snorkeling. There's some hiking involved to some beautiful lagoons but the fish are amazing.\nMy last recommendation would be Alona Beach. Book a place at Harold's Mansion and they will take you where there are shallow reefs and turtles. They're protected reefs.\nCheck these places out online first but these are three of my favorite spots here in the islands. Enjoy!\nNov 23, 2017\nSouthern Leyte\nby: Anonymous\nI stayed in Philippines from 2013 to 2017. We went snorkeling at Balicasag, Apo Island, Tubod Marine Sanctuary in Siquijor, Lusong Island near Coron, Club Paradise in Busuanga, Port Barton in Palawan, Manila Channel in Puerto Galera... Those were really fantastic, however, snorkeling at Limasawa Island and off shore of Padre Burgos in southern Leyte was most impressive since there are less fishing boats and divers & tourists. Just pristine corals were there! Great!\nNov 23, 2017\nIs There Good Shore Snorkeling from Any of the Resorts/Rentals?\nby: ColoradoSnorkelerAddict\nWe will be traveling with 2 kids who both snorkel but are under 10. It's nice (and easy) to stay at a resort that has snorkeling from the beach. We are fond of Roatan for that but it is too full of tourists and panhandlers now.\nJan 31, 2019\nby: Lynne\nMy husband and I just came back from Coron, Philippines, having spent the first week of January 2019 there at Discovery Island Dive Resort.\nWe recommend two snorkel sites very close to Coron Town proper: Siete Pescados and Coral Garden. You can still see the town from those sites, and there was so much to see there that we did not feel the need to venture out to the farther sites. The corals were very large and colorful.\nAt Coral Garden, the reef was very shallow near the shore then slopes down like a wall into the deeps. It makes it favorable to see a lot regardless of the high or low tide. We saw clownfish hiding in anemones, sea urchins, parrotfish and angelfish, pufferfish, pipefish, and lionfish. I had previously read reports of Coral Garden and Siete Pescados sites as being \"not as pristine as before\" but both looked very healthy and were teeming with life.\nIn addition, the two sites are close to the Kangayan Lake and Twin Lagoon swimming areas. The swimming areas are calm, protected waters that are good for relaxing or allowing children to have a splash, but nothing to see there if you're a snorkeler.\nIf you get easily seasick as I do, know that the waters are usually calm and protected, not like the open ocean. Seasickness is another reason I prefer to book a private boat, and given it was so reasonable in price, I'd recommend it to any snorkelers, since the other passengers on a group tour may vote to spend more time at the beaches or swimming holes rather than the scenic coral reefs.\nWe mostly used the hotel's boats and staff, which were more expensive than hiring a boat at the town marina. It was still very reasonable, less than $60 USD for a half day private excursion. One day we met up with family and did a large group tour using one of the many boats for hire at the Coron town marina. At the marina or at the hotel, you can opt to join a group or hire a private charter. Private was very reasonable, about $50-$100 USD for the day or half day depending on your destinations. The tourism board has a standard menu of destinations priced, but you can still negotiate downwards, especially if there are boats available mid-morning or later. Note there are additional $5-$10 fees per person at each snorkel site which help keep the islands undeveloped and monitored for pollution and careless dive boats.\nWe'd also recommend staying at Discovery Island Dive Resort for the quality of friendly attentive service, delicious western & Filipino menu, and the laid back, relaxing vibe. It's not a four star resort, just really more of an inn, but it's on a private island just a 10 minute boat ride from the Coron town marina.\nIf you want to avoid the nightly and pre-dawn street noise in the form of cocks crowing and motorcycle revving, don't stay in the downtown area near the marina. Coron WesTown Resort is where my family members stayed and it was a true resort by western standards. We preferred a more local vibe and highly recommend Discovery Island.\nThere are one or two resorts that offer snorkeling right offshore from their resort, but they were much higher priced than Discovery Island, and either a long car drive or boat ride from Coron town proper.\nI struggled to find up to date info prior to our trip, so I hope this is useful. We would certainly repeat this trip again, and mix in some additional Asian snorkel sites.\nMay 13, 2019\nby: Anonymous\nDiscovery Island Resort is wonderful yes! Been there. The staff and restaurant I liked. The snorkeling in Coron... wow!\nMay 21, 2019\nby: Kieran\nI have snorkeled all over the Philippines over the past 10 years and loved every spot. Based upon water clarity, coral formations, fish variety and ease of access, I would rate Puerto Galera very highly.\nFor longer trips I would rate Coron as very good as you get great coral formations, WWII Japanese wrecks, snorkeling in lakes inside limestone islands and good fish varieties.\nFor amazing locations to be snorkeling in then El Nido is in a league of its own and once again the sites are long days on local bangkas (boats) that get you to secluded beaches, caves and other very cool rock formations.\nUp until a few years ago snorkeling at Sohoton Cove on Bucas Grande was very interesting in amongst the jellyfish.\nMalapascu has the coral gardens which are good as well as its own WWII Japanese wreck.\nApo Island is good for abundant turtles in a relatively small area.\nMay 21, 2019\nby: Jeff\nI live in the Philippines and snorkeling is a daily activity, weather permitting. The mention of Puerto Galera reminded me of an island tour I did last year.\nA smaller boat followed us to a reef at one point, and I was told the best snorkeling experience is to hold onto a little handle off the side\ud83e\udd14. Speed snorkeling! Very interesting experience. A few times i wished I could have stopped and checked out turtles and groups of reef fish. Definitely a different snorkeling experience\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc1f.\nMar 02, 2020\nby: Andy\nThe best snorkeling I ever found in the Philippines over the past 14 years is NoaNoa Island in Taytay Bay of Sulu Sea in northeast Palawan. I've been to a lot of places in the Philippines but I can't say that I've been everywhere, so for the record I say NoaNoa Island snorkeling is one of the best in the Philippines.\nAll Rights Reserved\n"

            "\u201cUp on the shore they work all day, out in the sun they slave away\u2019 \u2013 Sebastian, The Little Mermaid.\nIf that sounds like you, slogging your way through work life and in desperate need of your next diving getaway, look no further than Indonesia. Other than its well known, and resultantly crowded diving spots in Bali, below are 10 lesser-known scuba diving sites that are an underwater paradise right out of Ariel\u2019s world, with directions on how to get there included.\nP.s. for those who haven\u2019t gotten their diving licenses yet.\u00a0, the clear and coral blanketed sea in these spots are also great spots for snorkelling.\nRead our other article on snorkelling and diving here:\nFinding Nemo might have introduced Mr. Ray the manta and Crush the turtle to you as a kid, but to bring your Disney dreams to life, head to Komodo National Park. Comprising of 3 main islands, Padar, Rinca and Komodo, this archipelago is home to endless gorgeous dive sites with more than 1000 species of fish.\nMake sure to dive into Manta Point to swim among huge manta rays, with spans that are probably longer than your height!\nFor those looking to snorkel, Taka Makassar Island, a strip of powdery white sand in the middle of the sea with calm and shallow waters is perfect for swimmers of all abilities. The tiny island is surrounded by bustling coral reefs and upon hopping into the waters, I easily spotted turtles and a reef shark.\nGetting there: From Bali, take a 1h flight to Labuan Bajo followed by a boat ride to Komodo Island. Most people use Labuan Bajo as a base for exploring the national park. For adventurous souls, opt for a 3 or 4-day live-abroad experience instead, where you get a multi-day exploration of the area.\n2. Wakatobi National Park \u2013 25 coral reefs and fluorescent sea creatures\nLocated in Southeast Sulawesi, Wakatobi National Park is hands down one of the best diving spots in Indonesia. The park is made of 4 islands surrounded by a pristine reef system with 25 coral reefs and 900 marine species including moray eels, dolphins and turtles.\nFor scuba diving, one of the best sites here is the Wakatobi House Reef. The currents here aren\u2019t strong and the waters are clear as glass, allowing you to view the underwater paradise in all its glory.\nIf you\u2019re an experienced diver, consider fluorescent night diving, or fluo-diving. UV light is used to illuminate the reefs, causing marine life to look like they\u2019re glowing. It\u2019s a psychedelic experience and even the most vibrant scenes from the Little Mermaid ain\u2019t got nothing on this.\nGetting there: Part of the reason why Wakatobi has such flourishing reefs in its seclusion. The easiest way to get to the island is to book a private 70-seat turboprop aircraft charter from Bali, provided by Wakatobi Resort that operates almost every Monday and Friday. Alternatively, take a flight from Bali to Makassar or Kendari for a connecting flight to Pulau Wangi Wangi, where there are daily boats that head to Wakatobi.\n3. Lombok Islands \u2013 sharks and underwater sculptures\nRight next door to the famous Bali is Lombok, a lesser-known sibling of the popular tourist hotspot that\u2019s definitely worth popping by for great diving opportunities.\nIf you like to live life on the edge, swim among scalloped and great hammerhead sharks at The Magnet dive site at Belongas Bay where these majestic creatures are sometimes sighted. Jaws might have given all sharks a bad rep, but hammerhead sharks are generally safe to swim with \u2013 although it always pays to be careful.\nShould sharks scare the bejeebers out of you, take a more relaxing snorkel with something that definitely won\u2019t bite \u2013 underwater statues. Located at Gili Meno, this gorgeous artificial reef called \u201cNest\u201d is made of 48 life-sized human sculptures and is an accessible spot only a short distance away from the beach!\nGetting there: There are direct flights from Singapore to Lombok, although flying indirect tends to be cheaper. If you\u2019re headed over from Bali, take an internal flight (25min), fast boat (2 hours) or public ferry (4-5 hours).\n\u2013 West Papua \u2013\nFor NatGeo-worthy scenes right in front of your eyes, head to Raja Ampat. It\u2019s touted as the best diving spot in the whole of Indonesia and there\u2019s no diving list complete without this underwater haven.\nThe archipelago comprises more than a thousand small islands surrounded by pristine waters that hold 75% of the world\u2019s coral species.\nOne of the best dive areas include the Arborek Jetty in the Dampier Strait, where there are schools of fish everywhere you look. If you\u2019re lucky you might just spot a fish vortex, where a large school of fish swims in a circle creating a fish \u201ctornado\u201d. Other creatures spotted here include pipefish, seahorses, sharks and wobbegongs.\nGetting there: As with all great dive sites, it\u2019s tough getting to Raja Ampat. From Singapore, take a flight to Sorong through Jakarta, Surabaya, Makassar or Mando. From Sorong\u2019s ferry harbour, take a public ferry to Wasai, which lies in the capital of the Raja Ampat regency. To get around, try staying on a liveaboard .\n5. Cenderawasih Bay \u2013 swim with whale sharks\nSpot the diver!\nImage credit: @dianapaboojianphotography\nItty bitty fish are adorable but if you want to dive with the big boys, there is no better place to go than Cenderawasih Bay, home to many whale sharks. They\u2019re the largest fish in the world and can grow up to 12 metres long \u2013 that\u2019s the length of an SBS bus!\nGuess you can say this is an overwhaleming experience.\nGetting there: From Singapore, fly to Biak via transit through Jakarta, Surabaya, Denpasar and Makassar. From Biak, take a local flight to Nabire, where you can get to Cederwaish bay by motorboat.\nAlternatively, take a liveaboard boat that departs from Biak, Nabire and Manokwari for an easier journey\n\u2013 Sulawesi \u2013\n6. Bunaken Islands \u2013 vertical seawalls up to 600m deep\nThis image isn\u2019t rotated \u2013 the sea bed becomes completely vertical as you go down!\nFor the underwater equivalent of a mountain range, head to Bunaken Islands where there are dramatic drop-offs and vertical seawalls that stretch up to 600 metres deep.\nThe walls here are lined with crevices and caves teeming with marine life. Reef sharks, napoleon wrasses and green turtles are among the commonly spotted animals in the area.\nSpotted: turtles chilling along the ledges\nPopular dive sites in the area include Lekuan I and II as well as Timor and Sachiko\u2019s Point where there are large diversities of coral and steep walls.\nGetting there: From Singapore, take a direct flight to Manado (3.5 hours). From there, it\u2019s an hour\u2019s boat ride to Bunaken Island. Private charters are also often available for hire with the island\u2019s various dive resorts.\n7. Togian Islands \u2013 aircraft bomber wrecks\nFor something different, head to Togian Islands where you\u2019ll be able to spot a 20-metre-long bomber wreck from the American air force in World War 2. The crash site is about an hour\u2019s boat ride away from Kadidiri.\nOther dive sites in the area include Unauna, where there\u2019s a large rock pinnacle, as well as Goa Goa for tunnel diving.\nGoa Goa\n8. Lembeh Island \u2013 muck diving photography and 88 diving spots\nPerfect for underwater photographers, Lembeh Island is a spot with lots of photogenic and colourful creatures and critters. Stretching 16 kilometres long, the Lembeh Strait between the island and mainland is dotted with more than 88 diving spots so you can\u2019t possibly run out of spaces to explore.\nFinding nemo? Try Lembeh Islands.\nThe island has great muck diving spots with sandy black slopes that that allows the colours of the sea creatures to pop in photos, as well as a decent visibility of 10 to 15m. Wait patiently and you\u2019ll be able to spot seahorses, octopi, and cuttlefish emerging out from their hiding spots.\nGetting there: From Singapore, the best way to get there is through a direct flight to Manado (3h20min). Following that, drive to Bitung (2h) and take a ferry to Lembeh Island (10min). Alternatively, arrange for transport to Lembeh with your diving resort from Manado.\n\u2013 Others \u2013\n9. Weh Island, Aceh \u2013 wreck diving, reef sharks and barracudas\nPulau Weh in Banda Aceh is a remote island largely untouched by tourists. That, on top of being declared as wildlife protected by the Indonesian government, the coral reefs here are healthy and teeming and are home to marine species such as black-spot angelfish, groupers and barracudas.\nOne of the most impressive diving spots here is the Sophie Rickmers Wreck, an impressive 134-metre long sunken ship that sits upright and intact on the seafloor. However, being more than 55 metres deep, decompression dives that are needed to get to the bottom are only open to advanced divers.\nOther dive spots in the area include Rubiah Sea Garden for a shallow and gentle dive, and Batee Tokong for spotting sharks and barracuda. Snorkelling spots with lots of marine life include Yulia Guest House Pier and the beach next to Eric Green House.\nGetting there: From Singapore, take a connecting flight to Banda Aceh. from the airport, head to the Ulee Lheu harbour and take a fast ferry (45min) or slow car ferry (1.5h) to Pulau Weh.\n10. Bangka Island \u2013 spot dugongs\nFor close encounters with dugongs without an aquarium glass in between, head to Bangka Islands. Among the islands 30 dive sites , they\u2019re said to be most commonly spotted at Peter\u2019s Sponge.\nAs the current in this area can be strong, and diving here is best suited for intermediate and advanced divers.\nFor those who have yet to attain their license, not to worry, for there are shallow snorkelling spots scattered around the island as well.\nGetting there: From Singapore, take an indirect flight to Pangkal Pinang on Bangka Island via Jakarta.\nDive into Indonesia\u2019s underwater paradise\nWith fewer people, more coral, and lots of marine life, it\u2019s a wonder that these spots are still under the radar. So snap on your goggles and dive into your next adventure, it\u2019s time for your mermaid dreams to come to life.\nOther things to do in Indonesia:\nTrending\n3 hours ago\n21 hours ago\n1 day ago\n2 days ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2020 TheSmartLocal.com\n120\nSHARES\n"

To better help you understand the world of skydiving, how it evolved, how safe it is and the various facets of the sport we\u2019ve created this page. Below you will find a number of topics to better help you understand a sport that is often misunderstood. If you are looking for answers to frequently asked questions on skydiving you can also find some answers here .\nThe History of Skydiving\nIt\u2019s firstly important to differentiate modern skydiving from the history of parachuting, while modern skydiving as we know it today has only been around for decades, the history of parachuting extends as far back as the 12th century. Evidence has pointed historians towards China as the first evidence of jumps that were made under parachute. These early iterations of parachutes were used by the Chinese to float down safety after making a leap from a solid platform object such as a cliff. While this method of jumping is more closely aligned to today\u2019s BASE jumping, it remains a key point in history and the evolution of the parachute.\nIt would be hundreds of years before the renowned multitalented inventor, Leonardo DaVinci, would sketch what is now considered the first \u2018modern\u2019 parachute design. This design was not tested until the 21st century when Adrian Nicholas created an exact replica and attempted to jump it from a height of 10 000 feet. He was forced to cut-away at 7 000 feet and deploy a standard parachute to complete the jump. The replica weighed in at over 180 pounds, making it a less than ideal solution to combat gravity.\nThe First Manned Parachute Jump\nFrance was leading the world in aeronautic progression in the 18th century with Frenchman S\u00e9bastien Lenormand being credited with the creation of the first modern parachute in 1783. In 1797 French aeronaut Andr\u00e9-Jacques Garnerin, who was 28 years old at the time, performed what is considered to be the first successful parachute jump. Garnerin was a student of the well respected ballooning pioneer, Jacques Charles. The first parachute, used by Garnerin was made from silk and spanned 23 feet in diameter. The device used rope to connect the parachute to a basket. This parachute system would then connect to a balloon in order to ascend, before being let go and left to float down to earth. In October of 1797 Garnerin performed what is now considered the world\u2019s first parachute jump, successfully landing back down on earth and making history. Also of note is the fact that this jump may have been the one being written into the history books, but years prior Jean Pierre Blanchard had been using the basket and parachute method, but only using dogs and was thus not a manned parachuting exercise.\nIt is important to remember that this was merely the first successfully record of modern parachuting, and it wasn\u2019t for centuries until the first skydive would take place. What differentiates this initial jump with that of a skydive, is that Gernerin never had any freefall and was always within the basket that was attached to the parachute, so the parachute would open automatically as he descended in the basket without any real freefall taking place.\nFrom Parachuting to Skydiving\nOnly in the 20th century did we see the progression of parachuting move towards what is now considered skydiving. The first true skydive took place in 1919 by Leslie Leroy Irvin who performed the first premeditated freefall parachute jump, what is now referred to as skydiving. Irvin had grown up with a passion for adventure and looked up to Charles Broadwick. Broadwick would perform similar acts to that of parachuting pioneer Gernerin, by ascending by balloon to a desired height and then releasing from the balloon and descending under parachute.\nIrvin was so inspired by these aeronautic adventures that he himself would later create a parachute at the age of 14. In his later teens he would become a stuntman in what was then a newly booming film industry. It was within his stuntman career that he would perform stunts using parachuting methods much like that his hero used. In 1914 he successfully made a parachute jump for the movie Sky High from a distance of 1000 feet.\nHe would later join the Army Air Services as a member of the parachute research team. Irvin was one of the individuals involved in the creation of the first static line parachute to be used for life saving purposes in war. By 1918 these new advances had helped create what was termed the Airplane Freefall Parachute Type-A. This new development became the backbone of modern skydiving as we know it today. The device incorporated the backpack storage, much like that found on today\u2019s rigs, while also containing a ripcord for deployment and pilot chute. The principles held by this design are mostly retained in today\u2019s skydiving gear with the ripcord, backpacks and pilot chute still being present.\nOn the 19th of April 1919 Leslie Irvin would voluntarily be the first person to attempt a freefall skydive from a plane. The parachute opened as expected and Irvin made it down to earth as theorized, although he did suffer a broken ankle from the landing.\nThe parachutes being used in the early 20th century were all round canopies and look much different to today\u2019s elliptical or square sports canopies. In the 1950s the first square parachute was invented, though it remained a mere decelerator, similar to that of the round parachutes before it. Only in the 1960s did the world start to see the rise of the multicell glide canopy, more closely aligned to what non-military skydivers are using today.\nAs each decade passes, we see further progress being made towards the parachute. Small changes to the canopy design as our understanding of aerodynamics increases, continue to help in creating a progressively more agile design. We\u2019ve seen skydiving move from the act of simply jumping out of an airplane without dying, to one that is focused on creating parachutes that can cater to specific disciplines and styles of flying, from faster and responsive canopies to larger and more stable options for beginner skydivers.\nHow to Start Skydiving\nSo you\u2019re been thinking about doing your first jump? Whether you\u2019re looking to simply experience the adrenaline of a tandem skydive or whether you\u2019re looking to enter the sport and become a skilled skydiver, we\u2019ll cover everything you need to know about getting started.\r\nWe recommend a tandem skydive as the starting point for all skydivers, whether you\u2019re looking to just do a single jump (in which case it is your only option), or if you\u2019re looking to get into the sport. A tandem skydive will ensure that you experience the sensations of freefall and give you an idea of the feeling that skydiving can provide you, without having to make the heft investment into completing an AFF course. Only only are tandem jumps affordable, but they\u2019re also available at almost all dropzones in the world.\nWhen performing a tandem jump you\u2019ll go through a training session beforehand to give you some insight into what will happen, how to position your body and how to land. Tandems are performed with a tandem master, an experienced skydiver who you will be attached to throughout the process. While you may have hoped that you could simply jump out of a plane by yourself, that certainly isn\u2019t the case. It requires a fair amount of training with an AFF course before you get to experience an unassisted solo jump.\nHistorically, when signing up for training you had the option of AFF or Static-line, however in recent years static-line training has mostly been discontinued as a training option and AFF being the preferred method of training.\nDo note that you should contact your local dropzone and enquire as to the limitations on age, weight or medical conditions that could prevent you from being viable to complete a tandem jump or AFF course at their dz.\nNow that you know what your options are when looking to skydive, you can start to look for skydiving near you.\nSo you\u2019ve decided that you want to skydive, whether you\u2019re looking to simply tick off that bucket list tandem, or whether you\u2019re looking to get involved with the sport, your initial process will likely be the same. As we stated above, we highly recommend a tandem as the first step when looking to skydive, and while it\u2019s possible to go straight into your AFF course, a tandem is still an affordable way to get a gauge on what you\u2019re getting into. When looking at where to skydive the first thing you should do is check out our dropzone listings . We have more than a thousand dropzones listed, with details on where they are located, what services they offer, the prices they charge as well as reviews to help you make your decision.\nDropzone reviews are an extremely valuable asset and one that can help ensuring that you don\u2019t end up at a dropzone with sub-par practices. We\u2019ve got our dropzone listings in such a way that you will be able to sort by country, pinned map locations or if you\u2019re in the United States, you\u2019ll also be able to find dropzone listings in your state. Using our dropzone map, you are able to locate your location quickly and easily and look at which dropzones are listed near you. Once you find your closet dropzones, you can then check out their listings and see what others have to say about them.\nOnce you\u2019ve found a dropzone that looks good to you, and that has positive reviews by other jumpers, you should give that dropzone a call or email to find out what their restrictions are and when they are able to accommodate you. Depending on the dropzone, you may have to wait a while for an appointment, though most dropzones will be able to cater to your request fairly quickly. Be sure to enquire about such things as medical issues, weight regulations and age restrictions that may be in place.\nIf you\u2019re getting into skydiving as a sport and are looking to move towards doing your AFF course, make sure that you take into account the proximity of the dropzone from your residence. You will be making quite a few trips to the dropzone, so it is certainly worth considering just how far you\u2019re willing to travel.\nThe topic of skydiving safety is one brought forward almost immediately by those interested in getting into skydiving or even before committing to their first tandem jump. The topic about whether or not skydiving is safe isn\u2019t as black and white as a simple yes or no answer and one is required to look at the risks involved while also taking into account the frequency of injuries or fatalities.\nWhen looking at the statistics for skydiving safety we need to take into account the frequency at which incidents do occur, in which disciplines they occur most, the causes of these incidents as well as how often one skydives.\nA proposed method to look at the risk of death in skydiving is to look at the unit measurement \u201cmicromort\u201d, a term used to indicate the risk of death per 1 million. This method of measurement makes it easy to compare with other activities and provides a better gauge on determining just how dangerous skydiving is.\nCalculating Skydiving Safety Risks\nForum member \u201cmaggyrider\u201d made a great post and dove into the statistical risk aspect in depth. In their post they brought forward the statistics on skydiving deaths, though the methods used have been argued by other members as there are numerous variables that make an exact calculation extremely difficult to determine; we recommend giving it a ready for some further interesting discussion on skydiving risk.\nWhen looking at the micromort statistics for skydiving on Wikipedia one can see that for the period 2000 - 2016 (for the United States) and 1994 \u2013 2013 (for the United Kingdom) the micromort per unit of exposure was 8 per jump in both cases. By contrast with another sport, in the UK scuba divers who were BSAC members had a micromort of 5 while non-BSAC members saw an increased micromort of 10, per dive \u2013 placing the skydiving risk somewhere between those two. When compared with non-skydiving related deaths you have more chance of being murdered in England and Wales (per year) than you do if you perform one skydive. Additionally, you are almost twice as likely to die from a homicide in Canada (per year) than you are to die doing one skydive.\nThe difference between skydiving safety and violent crime however, is that the odds of dying from skydiving will increase the more you do it. Given that there were 41 fatalities from 4,864,268 jumps (United Kingdom), this tells us that the likelihood of death per jump as a percentage is 0.00084. This figure appears extremely low at first, but now let\u2019s take into account the amount of jumps done by an active skydiver, provided you perform 200 jumps a year, the chance of dying from skydiving in a year as a percent becomes 0.168 percent. This means that there is a 12.6% chance of death for skydivers who have clocked 15 000 jumps.\nWhat these numbers suggest is that while skydiving remains a fairly dangerous sport, it is more dangerous due to the aspect of volume, than it is in its base value. This means that choosing skydiving as a sport will certainly increase your likelihood of a skydiving related death, for those simply wanting to have a tandem jump done, the single jump does not pose a significant thread, no more so than driving a car 1840 miles.\nIt\u2019s not that simple\u2026\nWhile the above statistics may do a fair job at giving some kind of indication on the safety of skydiving, it is by no means a definitive statistic and there\u2019s just simply too many variables to take into consideration when looking at skydiving fatalities and safety. For example, depending on the type of skydive being performed as well as the skill level of the jumper, the odds will change dramatically.\nSo while you may have been looking for a simple yes or no answer to the question of whether skydiving is dangerous or not, it remains relative to the type of skydiving you\u2019re doing and how often you are jumping. If you are concerned about doing your first tandem, the good news is that your likelihood of dying is extremely low and in fact safer than many other aspects of everyday life that don\u2019t get taken into consideration.\nSkydiving Gear\nThe equipment you use is often a vital aspect of any sport, but there is arguably none more important than in skydiving where your primary concern should be safety. The progression of skydiving gear throughout the centuries has been fascinating to look back on, however only in recent decades did we see a heavy focus being placed on the development of skydiving gear for recreational use. After all, skydiving as a sport is still less than a century old. Before diving into the progression of skydiving gear over the past 50 years, let\u2019s first take a look at what the core pieces of skydiving equipment are and what role they play.\nMain Parachute\nThe main parachute is quite self-explanatory in its name. It is the primary parachute used by skydivers during their jump. These main parachutes come in various designs and comprised of cells which are typically either 7 or 9 celled nowadays. The differences between 7 and 9 cell mains were more noticeable in the past, with certain attributes being tied to each celled canopy. Today however, there are both 7 and 9 cell designs which overlap in what they are able to provide the skydiver. For instance, 9-cells used to be considered as having the better glide between the two, while nowadays there are 7-cell canopies out that can match or even better the glide offered by some 9-cells. It is therefore best to approach each canopy individually and look at what it offers, and to what skill level it caters. In addition to the cells of a canopy, the shape also plays an important role. The main shapes offered in recreational parachutes are rectangular, semi-elliptical and elliptical. Rectangle and semi-elliptical canopies are more popular for newer jumpers while elliptical are generally considered to be for those with some experience behind them. The reason for this is because the elliptical canopy shape translates into a very responsive main canopy that can easily be too responsive for newer jumpers.\nReserve Parachute\nThe reserve parachute is the one you hope you never have to use, but skydive long enough and the chances are you\u2019re going to. A reserve is deployed when there is a problem with the main and you need to cut-away. Think of it this way, a reserve is there as your backup plan if something goes wrong with your main. Reserves are typically the same size or slightly larger the main, you obviously don\u2019t want to cut away from a malfunction only to find yourself with adrenalin already rushing, under a smaller canopy than you\u2019re used to. The reserves are typically 7-cell canopies in order to provide a fast and stable opening, you obviously don\u2019t want a slow release when deploying your reserve in an emergency situation.\nContainer\nContainers are where your chutes are stowed. You know that backpack looking thing? That\u2019s your container. Containers are more complex than they look though, and are designed to deploy your canopy in the safest possible manner, while also being comfortable to wear. Containers are ever-evolving as the sport of skydiving progresses and the advancements on newer containers offer far more bells and whistles than earlier models.\nAAD\nAutomatic activation devices are devices which automatically deploy either the main or reserve canopy from the container system. These safety devices are used as a measure to ensure that should there be a problem in the manual deployment of the parachute, or a malfunction occurring, that the chute will still be deployed. For instance, if a skydiver suffered a seizure or some other kind of medical emergency while in freefall and they are unable to deploy their canopy, the AAD will be set to release the canopy after a certain altitude is reached (or after a certain amount of time). AADs have undergone small changes throughout the years to ensure that they have the most accurate altitude information for deployment. Most modern AADs are electronic in nature and have a very accurate handle on altitude.\nAltimeter\nAn altimeter is a device that displays to a skydiver what altitude they are at. There are several types of altimeters available on the market, digital altimeters, analogue altimeters and then audible altimeters. Digital and analogue models are usually wrist mounted, allowing for easy visuals of the altitude of the jumper. Audible altimeters are a bit different as these do not display a value, but rather they play a sound to the skydiver (usually mounted within the helmet) to alert them of their altitude. The choice of whether to go audible, digital or analogue is mostly preferential with price being the most deciding factor for many jumpers. Digital altimeters tend to cost a fair bit more than your regular analogue altimeters and thus analogue still has a large presence today, despite being the oldest of the designs.\nWingsuit\nWingsuit flying has exploded in popularity over the past decade or so, in many ways taking over from the 90s craze of sky surfing. Wingsuits are designed to reduce the rate at which the skydiver falls, by using a webbed design between both the arms and body and between the legs. Wingsuit skydiving is not something that is recommended for new jumpers and instead tends to be focused towards jumpers who already have some skydiving experience. The exact level of experience one should have before completing a wingsuit jump is a matter of debate, with some feeling as though there should be proficiency tests before allowing them, while others feel you can just judge the situation based off jump numbers.\nHelmet\nWhile the assumption may be that your skydiving helmet is there for ground collisions, the truth is the helmet is most effective in its responsibility in mid air collisions between jumpers. There are two main categories of helmets for skydiving, the full face helmet and the open helmet. The design you choose to wear should be whichever you feel most comfortable with, though should you opt for an open face helmet, you will also need to invest in some skydiving goggles to protect the eyes. Helmets have become more than just another safety measure though, for those with a passion for photography or videography, different helmet designs are created in order to cater for the mounting of cameras.\nGoggles\nGoggles are a mandatory part of your skydiving gear if you\u2019re jumping with an open faced helmet, acting as an essential eye protection method. Goggles are typically affordable and easy to acquire.\nJumpsuits\nJumpsuits are an optional extra for skydivers. For the casual skydiver there is no real need for a jumpsuit, however for those looking to increase performances in freefall or perhaps get into tracking, a jumpsuit is going to be able to improve your aerodynamics and provide you with a better track, especially the case for specialized tracking suits which still fall into the category of a jumpsuit.\nUsed Skydiving Gear\nSkydiving is by no means a cheap sport and the gear can come in at quite a cost. Because of this, it's not uncommon for skydivers to buy used gear to jump with. While having some fresh new gear is great, if you're on a budget you shouldn't hesitate to consider the second hand market when looking to gear up. We offer free skydiving classifieds where you'll be able to look through hundreds of ads and see if there's anything that fits the bill of what you're after. Dealing with scammers is always a concern when it comes to online classifieds, so we do advise that all those buying used gear, regardless of where you're buying from, implement some basic safety precautions to ensure that you don't get caught out by someone trying to steal your money.\n1. Be weary of individuals who wish to use money transfer. While not all of these individuals will be scammers, it is a common payment method used by scammers. Though recently more have started to adopt PayPal as well, usually using stolen PayPal accounts.\n2. If it's too good to be true, it's probably a scam. There are often cases where individuals list great items at unbelievable bargains causing the buyer to act quickly to avoid losing out on the deal. If you do see someone offering a bargain, contact them - but be careful in your vetting of their legitimacy.\n3. Excess payment is a big red flag. This is usually for those who are selling online and encounter a scammer trying to make a purchase from them. They may offer to have their own courier come to collect it, or offer you more than it's worth. These are suspicious activities that should prompt further verification of validity.\n4. Find our information about the person! If you're unsure about whether a buyer or seller is a scammer, you should seek as much information from them as possible. We recommend asking them for their home DZ or rigger's number so you can call to verify. You could also ask them for their USPA number or other information relating to their skydiving career that could assist you in determining if they are to be trusted. There are a few cases where skydivers get scammed by other jumpers, but vast majority remain general scams like those found on Craigslist.\nFor more information on buying used gear, we've published several articles on the topic.\nSkydiving Disciplines\nThere are numerous disciplines that one can specialize in, from those that are individual orientated to ones that incorporate a small team and even those that consist of dozens of other skydivers who work together to form world record setting big-way jumps. When becoming a licenses skydiver, you may choose to just remain a fun jumper and skydive for fun, though if you choose to specialize in a discipline you will have no shortage of options, and can easily work your existing skills into the discipline you head into. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the common disciplines skydivers head into and see what they\u2019re comprised of:\nIndoor Skydiving\nIndoor skydiving involves wind tunnels which create a column of rapidly moving air being pushed upwards while gravity pulls the jumper down, the result is a sensation that mirrors freefall, where the user gets to experience the same kind of feeling as if they were in a skydiving freefall. Historically, wind tunnels would often be found outdoors and were open. In recent years there has been a heavy focus on the more sophisticated indoor skydiving facilities , with many even offering their restaurants and recreational areas.\nIndoor skydiving is a great way for those with a fear of the safety related to skydiving to experience the sensation of freefall without the risk. For those that use indoor skydiving as a bucket list experience, it is a fairly affordable venture and can prove to be a whole lot of fun. For many, the act of trying out indoor skydiving results in them feeling inspired to head to their local dropzone and start acquiring their skydiving license. Though indoor tunnels aren\u2019t just for the casual visitor and instead act as both a training grounds for skydivers looking to master their freeflying skills in a more manageable environment or for those who form part of competitive freeflying teams who need to practice in the colder, wetter winter months where skydiving may not be possible.\nIn addition to these two types of clients, wind tunnels also have their own breed of competition. Professional tunnel flying has become more popular in recent years and because of the safety aspect, many children are now also engaging in competitive tunnel flying. The amount of talent that is generated from indoor skydiving is truly astonishing and it will no doubt play a huge role in how the discipline of freeflying evolves in the skydiving world, with many bringing forward their talents from the tunnel and incorporating them into their skydiving routines.\nWhen looking where to indoor skydive , there\u2019s no shortage of tunnels these days, especially within the United States where many new establishments have recently opened. You can visit our indoor skydiving section and find a tunnel near you to begin experiencing freeflying.\nAccuracy Landing\nAccurracy Landing stems back all the way to the middle of the 20th century when skydivers would attempt to land in the closest proximity to a marker placed on the ground. The distance from the center of the mark to the competitor's landing area would be measured and the person with the lowest measure (closest to the center) would be the winner. Even after more than 60 years this discipline remains active in many competitions and has changed little since the initial competitions.\nWhat has changed though, is both the size of the target, the way measurements are calculated and the parachutes used. In the early days the targets were 10cm in diameter, and placed inside of a 25 meter landing area. Now days, the inner most target is a mere 2cm in size and distance between the landing and the target center is calculated digitally in 1 centimeter increments.\nBack when the discipline started, military parachutes were the standard and one had very little control over the canopy in comparison to modern parachutes. As the development of canopies progressed, so did the ability to accurately fly them and subsequently the ability to hit smaller targets.\nExit altitude for competitive accurracy landing is from 1000 meters.\nSwooping\nSwooping is a high intensity discipline of skydiving that revolves around high speed canopy flight. Because of its dangerous nature, swooping has found itself struggling due to dropzone regulations, specifically regulations around 270-degree turns. While most skydivers find the majority of their discipline revolving around the time in freefall, with swooping - it's all about what is done under canopy.\nThe dangers that exist within the swooping discipline are a combination of what are low exit altitudes, small canopies and high speed manouvers which take place close to the ground. Because of this, swooping can be considered a high risk discipline that requires excellent canopy control skills.\nSwoop ponds are often used in the discipline, where jumpers will perform an approach turn at high speed and then pass over the water by mere centimeters (or even dipping one's toes in while passing over). Swooping competitions are often seen as one of the more spectator friendly skydiving competition types because of the clear view that spectators on the ground are able to have on the jumpers.\nFrequently Asked Skydiving Questions\nIs Skydiving Safe?\nThat depends who you ask. Safe is a rather relative term that becomes hard to quantify, however skydiving is for the most part rather safe when paired alongside many other sports. In fact, it may surprise you that running, cycling and swimming have more deaths per 100,000 people than skydiving does. Skydiving is especially safe for tandem jumpers who are doing their first jump, this is because there are less risks being taken in the activity. Tandem deaths are few and far between, with most skydiving incidents occuring from solo skydivers who already have a number of jumps under their belt.\nNot sold yet? Here's some statistics on the safety of skydiving compared to other sports, as well as the odds of a fatal skydive taking place.\nThe odds of a fatal tandem skydive are about 0.0003%\nThe odds of a fatal solo jump are about 0.0008%\nThe odds of dying while swimming are nearly twice as high\nIs Skydiving Scary?\nSkydiving can be scary, but it can also be exciting! Much the same as a roller coaster, jumping out of an aeroplane is definitely not something our natural instinct is cool with. In fact, it can be pretty terrifying for some people. But also much like a roller coaster, the scariest part is usually before you have commited to the activity. The ride up is by far more scary than the ride back down under canopy, your adrenaline will take over and you will be allowed to experience the thrill without the anxiety you may have felt on the way up.\nThe jitters you feel on your first jumps do ease with time, if you continue to skydive you will notice it becomes far less anxiety inducing than it was in the beginning. Though with that said, even the most experienced jumpers can have some nerves on their ride up.\nIs Skydiving Worth it?\nSkydiving isn't the most affordable activity out there, at around $250 a tandem jump you may be wondering if it's really worth the money. The answer is, absolutely! While $250 is a lot of money, skydiving is one of those experiences that make it onto most people's bucket lists. It provides a feeling of freedom that is hard to replicate. Even explaining the experience is difficult as there is nothing quite like it. If you're looking to get into the sport of skydiving, the costs are much higher and will be discussed below in the question of whether or not skydiving is expensive.\nIs Skydiving a Sport?\nSkydiving is most certainly a sport, one with a number of different disciplines, each with their own set of competitive rules. Skydiving never started out as a sport though, and even after skydiving picked up in popularity as a recreational activity it only really developed into a true sport years later. Back in 1995 Sky Surfing was at its peak and was even part of the X Games competitions, and while perhaps skydiving isn't in the same mainstream limelight it once had in the extreme sports world, it certainly remains a sport, with new competitive ventures and disciplines being developed regularly.\nIs Skydiving Fun?\nMore so than words can describe. Skydiving is fun in all of it's disciplines, whether you're doing your first tandem skydive and simply experiencing life in the sky or whether you're an experienced skydiver specializing in a competitive discipline, the sport itself has the potential to change your views on fear itself. If you're on the fence about whether or not you should try skydiving, you absolutely should.\nHow Much Does Skydiving Cost?\nSkydiving costs vary greatly depending on the type of jump you are doing. If you're doing your first tandem skydive you can expect to pay between $200 and $300 for your jump. If you're looking to gain your AFF licensing through an AFF course, you'll find that prices become more steep with a total cost of around $3000-$4000 to complete your AFF training and A-license course. Once licensed your cost per jump will decrease significantly to around $30-$40 a jump ticket. However, the main cost will still come with the acquirement of gear, skydiving gear is certainly not cheap - but you can always look at purchasing used gear to make it a bit more affordable.\nCan Skydiving cause a heart attack?\nNo more than going for a run can give you a heart attack. There have been very few cases of individuals suffering heart attacks while skydiving, though they have occurred. It is more than likely that these heart attacks would have occurred regardless of the skydive, but the sample size is so small that any real attribution of direct cause is anecdoctal. With that said, if you are worried about an existing heart condition, speak to your doctor first before booking your skydive. To paraphrase a reddit user, the prices are the most likely cause of a heart attack when jumping.\nCan skydiving damage your ears?\nSkydiving definitely has the potential for ear trauma, and we highly recommend that every skydiver, whether a licensed jumper or simply a tandem passenger employ proper ear safety measures to ensure that ear problems do not occur. The first aspect that impacts the ears is simply the noises involved in performing a jump, from the loud engine noises of the aircraft on ascent through to the sound the air makes as you're descending in freefall. Ear plugs are a must-have for your jump and will assist in protecting your ears from harm, we've got an in depth article on why you should be jumping with earplugs here .\nThe second risk towards ear injury relates to congestion in the sinuses. If you have any sinus congestion, we highly recommend postponing your jump until you are healthier. Jumping with congested sinus or an existing ear infection poses a risk for bursting your eardrums.\nCan you skydive when pregnant?\nSkydiving while pregnant is a controversial topic, there are people on both sides who are very passionate about how they feel towards it. We are hesitant to make any clear cut answers to this question as we feel it's completely up to the parent to decide whether they want to adopt the risks that come with the activity. However, Amy Blackwell wrote an in-depth article on the topic which we highly recommend reading.\nHow old do you have to be to skydive?\nThe minimum age to perform a tandem skydive varies depending on the country. In the United States the minimum age is 18 years of age, until 2014 it was possible for those between the ages of 16 and 18 were able to jump with parental consent, however this was changed to a standard age limit of 18 across the board. In Australia and Germany one is able to skydive from just 12 years old with parental consent. In South Africa, France and United Kingdom the minimum age is 16, with parental consent required for those between the ages 16 and 18.\nCan you skydive in winter?\nYou can certainly skydive in winter, depending on your location. In some areas of the world, dropzones may close for the winter period while other locations with more moderate winters may continue jumping operations through the season. It is entirely dependent on the temperatures, winds and precipitation that occur during the winter months. During winter, dropzones that operate during the winter months may be required to postpone or cancel your appointment based off the weather. It's not uncommon for jumpers in the northern states to head south during the winter months to get in more jumps through the cold season.\nCan you skydive in the rain?\nTechnically you can, there's a lot of skydivers who have jumped in the rain. But it's not the most pleasant experience, the speeds one reaches during freefall causes the rain drops to sting more than one may think. In practice, rain jumps aren't very common though. Most jumps will be postponed if there are low level clouds because of the safety concerns. So even though you can physically jump in the rain, it is certainly not the best practice.\nArticle written by Bryn De Kocks\nAbout Us\n"

            "A Singaporean craft microbrewery, smokehouse and restaurant.\nThere\u2019s nowhere else like us. Smoked meats, craft beer, outdoor barbeque, starry skies. You name it, we\u2019ve got it right here at Little Island Brewing Co.\nTHE CONCEPT\nBeers\nWe only serve the beers brewed in house, varying the flavours and the styles as often as we can. Find out more on our Microbrewery and Beer pages, or come down and talk to the brewers themselves! For information on what\u2019s on tap for the week, follow us on Facebook and Instagram and get updates on the fly!\nFood\nSure, you could find Western cuisine anywhere in Singapore, but you wouldn\u2019t find everything in one place. You can have fried sea bass, smoked beef brisket, grilled snapper, crispy pork, stewed ribs, oven baked pork knuckle, roast lamb, suckling pig, paella rice, it\u2019s almost endless! Check out our menu here, and follow us on Facebook and Instagram to stay updated on promotions and new items.\nSpace\nTwo huge units of indoor seating, two areas of alfresco seating, a playground for the kids, a window into the brewery, there\u2019s hardly anywhere in skyscraper Singapore that\u2019s like us. Designed by Akira Kita of AKA Architecture and Interior Design , two plain HDB shop lots have turned into a beautiful cozy space where you can relax and enjoy life. Sea breeze, rustling trees and starry skies come free of charge!\nTHE PEOPLE\nFrancis Khoo\nFounder\nFrancis can be described as a hippy gastronomist and spent the last 20 years experimenting with different cuisines, discovering new ingredients and recipes, sampling and honing new taste experiences from humble street hawker fare to award winning restaurants around the world. On a chance encounter with Steve\u2019s Storm beer one night about chicken betutu dinner at Paul Turley\u2019s house in Bali, Francis began his new found fascination with craft beer.\nSteve Spinney\nBrewmaster\nAn award winning brew master based in Bali, Indonesia, Steve has had more than a dozen years of experience in operating a commercial microbrewery. He pioneered, manufactured and distributed the first craft beer brand in Bali. His famous \u201cStorm Beer\u201d garnered many awards, notably winning 3 consecutive Gold Awards in the Asian Beer Competition.

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\nBest microbreweries in Singapore\nBest microbreweries in Singapore\nLeave the commercial beers on the 7-Eleven shelf and get your taste buds in a tangle at these local microbreweries instead\nBy Iliyas Ong |\nMarina Bay\nWhat No prizes for guessing on which floor this bar and restaurant is perched. Billed as the world\u2019s highest microbrewery, LeVeL33 gloriously overlooks the Marina Bay, and, thanks to the decor and service, is perhaps the most sophisticated place to quaff a locally brewed beer.\nOn tap Five brews are permanently on the menu: an IPA, stout, wheat beer, house porter and blonde lager. They bear classic flavour profiles \u2013 the brewery claims to use \u2018authentic recipes and brewing methods\u2019 \u2013 so don\u2019t expect funky American-style notes. Every quarter, LeVeL33 also pours out a seasonal beer, like a chestnut beer for Christmas and a pumpkin ale for Halloween.\nOn plates Here\u2019s where LeVeL33 stands out from the pack. The food here, courtesy of chef James Tegerdine, is far from your greasy wings and fries. Think Miyazaki wagyu, corn-fed poulet, kangaroo loin and other modern, upmarket plates. And all the dishes come with recommended pairings, too.\nKallang\nWhat Four vats dominate this industrial-cool shophouse space \u2013 there\u2019s a second storey you can book out for parties \u2013 that opened in 2014. It can get shoulder-to-shoulder tight, so either come early or make a reservation.\nOn tap Four proprietary microbrews ($7/half-pint, $15/pint) are on constant rotation: The Blk 6.22, a dark ale and our favourite of the lot; The Yellow Van, a pale ale; The Manuka Stout, a honeyed stout; Small Monster, an IPA; and The General, which isn\u2019t so much a beer as it is a ginger-flavoured shandy. Besides those, the bar also has craft beer the likes of Fresh Squeezed IPA, Fourpure Pale Ale and Hitachino Nest Pale Ale on tap.\nOn plates The menu checks all the caf\u00e9-standard boxes: burgers, pizzas, pastas and grilled meats. Our smoked duck pizza ($18) has a thin crust halfway between Timbre\u2019s and Skinny Pizza\u2019s, while our pulled pork burger ($18) is a decent, juicy effort that you\u2019ll probably end up scarfing down anyway, like we did.\nMeet the brewer Yeo King Joey, with more than ten years of experience in home brewing, is responsible for the pours. The 52-year-old is an aeronautical engineer by day, but checks in on the brews every evening.\nRochor\nWhat Hospoda started brewing in January this year, with Czech-style beers its calling card. But the fact that beer is brewed in and issued from a space the size of a walk-in closet will send you into a tizzy even before lips touch pint glass.\nOn tap Just two: a dark lager and a pilsner ($10-$12/half-pint, $14-$16/pint). Hospoda also pours out a third beer called the Bohemian Mix, which is equal parts of the dark lager and pilsner. We recommend the latter \u2013 it\u2019s full-bodied and robust yet still crisp enough for a warm night on Hospoda\u2019s outdoor-only seating area.\nOn plates Your standard-issue menu of bar bites, such as sausages ($12), burgers ($12), spicy wings ($8) and fries ($6). To be frank, the food seems to be an after-thought.\nMeet the brewer The age-old tale of banker-turned-tinker/tailor/soldier/spy rings true in Hospoda\u2019s case. Darryl Chuan is only 26, and left a career in private equity to learn how to brew Czech-style beer. A few months later, Chuan transformed what had initially been a hobby into a full-fledged business \u2013 and you can taste the fruits of his labour right here.\nChangi\nWhat Yes, it\u2019s ridiculously ulu. But trust us, a visit to this one-year-old microbrewery is well worth your Uber fare. Little Island occupies a warehouse-like space on the eastern reaches of Singapore, pouring out a range of ales, porters and stouts. Bonus points for its laid-back vibe \u2013 the beach is just a stroll away \u2013 and the \u201960s psychedelic-inspired beer labels.\nOn tap The draft beer list \u2013 Little Island also serves craft cider \u2013 is on constant rotation, with the brewery frequently concocting new brews. A Whiter Shade of Pale Ale is light enough to offer respite from the non-air-conditioned space, while the Black Magic Dry Irish Stout is a creamy, smooth and full-bodied beverage. And the prices are cut-rate, too. Thanks to Little Island\u2019s pour-it-yourself system, you\u2019ll only pay about $2 to $3 for 100 mililitres of happy juice.\nOn plates Weekend brunch is also where Little Island excels. From noon to 2.30pm, chow down on dishes like fish and chips, full English breakfasts and eggs Benedict for just 15 bucks each. We say go for the brisket sandwich (also $15), stuffed with slabs of beef made tender from languishing in the smoker for 15 hours.\nMeet the brewer Steve Spinney is the brains behind the vats. The English brewmaster is best known for setting up the now-defunct Storm Beer brewery in Bali, and he\u2019s responsible for Little Island\u2019s intensely tasty beverages.\nRaffles Place\nWhat The clubby and touristy vibes of Clarke Quay might not seem ideal for a microbrewery, but The Pump Room\u2019s ten years of existence will prove all you naysayers wrong. Granted, you\u2019ll have to muscle your way through crowds and particularly daft servers, but the beer at the end of it is worth the hassle. If you\u2019d rather avoid that area, the bar has an outlet in Great World City, too.\nOn tap Thanks to massive 3,000-litre tanks, five beers ($10.50-$16.50) are available all year round and poured straight from those vats. The Pump Room Lager is the best-seller, and it\u2019s easy to see why: it\u2019s the most approachable drink on this list. Our favourite, however, has to be the Golden Ale, a fruity, summery brew that bursts with subtle raisin notes.\nOn the menu We hate to say this, but avoid the food \u2013 everything from Tomahawk steaks ($108) to duck confit ($32) \u2013 at all costs. It\u2019s simply not worth the pretty penny.\nMeet the brewer Hayman Tin has been brewing at The Pump Room for seven years now, and he prides himself on brewing traditional beer \u2018to style\u2019 \u2013 which means to say, an ale\u2019s an ale, and wolfberries should be saved for soups and TCM elixirs. That said, Tin puts out a more experimental brew once every three to four months, and it\u2019s called, simply, the Brewmaster\u2019s Reserve.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "2020-04-23 22:54:18\nHow to Make Beer\nBrewing beer at home is easy. If you can make mac and cheese from a box without help, you can make beer.\nNOTE: This is a basic overview for brewing an extract beer recipe . Click here to\u00a0learn about all-grain brewing .\nTHE 4 BASIC STEPS:\nBrewing Kettle\nBeer Recipe Kit (or individual ingredients)\nIf gathering all of that sounds like too much work, simply choose one of Northern Brewer's beer making kit that have everything you need to brew beer,\u00a0all in one box.\n1. Steep Grains. Fill your 5-gallon brew kettle with 2.5 gallons of water. As you heat your water, steep your grains for 20 minutes, or until your water reaches 170 degrees.\u00a0 When you remove your grains, let the water drip out of the grain bag and into the kettle.\u00a0 Don't squeeze your grain bag as you don't want to extract tannins, which may give your beer unwanted flavors.\n2. Bring kettle to a boil - Once your kettle comes to a rolling boil\u00a0remove it from heat and add malt extracts. Once the extract is dissolved return to a boil. Hops will now be added at various intervals. (Note: Be careful not to boil over when hops are added.) Refer to your exact recipe as to when you need to add hops to your boil.\n3. You now have wort - Otherwise known as sugar water.\u00a0Cool your wort as quickly as possible. This can be done one of two ways:\nIce Bath -\u00a0Simply set\u00a0your pot into a sink\u00a0filled with ice water.\nUse a wort chiller -\u00a0Insert chiller into your wort.\u00a0Run cold water from your tap through the chiller and out to the sink.\u00a0 A wort chiller is the most effective way, but either will get you the desired results.\nDon't forget to sanitize all your supplies! Then...\n1. Pour\u00a0cooled wort into the fermenter. Some\u00a0brew kettles\u00a0even have a valve for easy transportation from your kettle to your fermenter.\n2. Add water to bring the level to 5 gallons.\n3. Aerate wort by splashing it around in its container. Yeast need oxygen, and splashing your wort will help.\n4. Add yeast. Dry yeast is the easiest,\u00a0as you don't have to prepare it beforehand. Sanitize the yeast pack\u00a0+ scissors, cut the corner off the yeast pack, and pour the yeast into the fermenter.\n5. Seal your fermenter, add a fermentation air lock, and store in a dark cool place. Ales should stay at 68 degrees to ferment properly.\n1. Cleanse everything: bottles, bottle filler, bottle caps, bottling bucket, and any transfer hoses used. Use a bottle brush on your bottles.\n3. Boil your priming sugar in 16\u00a0oz of water. After it cools, add it\u00a0directly to the bottling bucket.\n4. Transfer your beer. Siphon the beer out of your fermenter and into your bottling bucket. Leave as much sediment in the fermenter as possible.\n5. Fill the bottles. Attach bottle filler to hose, and\u00a0hose to bottling bucket spigot. Open the bottling bucket spigot and push the bottle filler to the bottom of the bottle.\nNOTE: Fill each bottle right to the top. When you remove the bottle filler, it will leave the perfect amount of space at the top of the bottle.\n6. Cap the bottles with caps and a bottle capper.\n7.\u00a0Store the bottles at room temperature for roughly two weeks. This gives your beer time to carbonate.\n1. Refrigerate.\n2. Enjoy.\nWe're\u00a0here 7 days/week, so Contact Us with any questions you\u00a0have about brewing!\nShop\nAdded to your cart:\n"

Here's how to get started.\nLuciano_QueirozGetty Images\nYou don't make your own beer to perfect the flavor, really. With more than 6,000 \u00adbreweries in the U.S. alone, there\u2019s a good chance someone\u2019s \u00adalready brewing something you enjoy. You make beer for one reason: because it\u2019s fun. That you also get beer out of it is just a delicious bonus.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nDana Hoff/Getty Images\nYou don\u2019t need fancy gadgets, says John LaPolla, cofounder of Bitter & Esters, a home-brew shop in Brooklyn, who\u2019s been brewing since 1991 and still uses buckets. \u201cMost people spend around $200 on equipment and ingredients,\u201d LaPolla says. First, find a home-brewing-supply shop near you at homebrewersassociation.org .\nThe Easy Way: Buy a starter kit . A five-gallon setup from Bitter & Esters costs $150 and includes a \u00adrecipe, ingredients, and all the gear except the \u00adkettle and the bottles.\nAnytime, Anywhere\nLuciano_QueirozGetty Images\nYou don\u2019t need a brewery, a science lab, or even a garage. \u201cI used to brew five gallons of cider in my kitchen cupboard. Then I graduated to the bottom of a utility shelf, then my closet,\u201d says Douglas Amport, the other cofounder of Bitter & Esters.\nAlthough there\u2019s no ideal time of year for brewing, most beers do well between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. In hotter climates, you can buy special yeast that works at up to 90 degrees, or put your fermenter in the fridge or a cooler filled with ice.\nStep 1. Make the Starter Wort\nYeast is an essential part of the beer process. These fungi feast on sugars, making alcohol as they go. The more yeast cells at work, the better the job they do at making alcohol. In this first step of the beer-making process, the yeast cells get a head start, hungrily dividing and populating as they feast on dry malt extract.\nIngredients:\n6 ounces dry malt extract\n1 package instant starter wort\nFirst, heat the water and malt to a boil for 10 minutes and then cool to 60 degrees F. You can check the temperature with a thermometer or by rule of thumb (it should be about room temperature).\nSanitize the gallon container with a no-rinse sterilizer or by following the manufacturer's instructions. Then, pitch the yeast by tossing in around 33 billion yeast cells (numbers depend on your starter kit) into the 60-degree wort. Cover the starter wort and put aside. Make sure the container is not airtight (aluminum foil will do the job).\nHeating The Water and Malt\nHeating water and malt for the starter wort.\nBottle The Wort\nBottling the wort.\nSeal the Bottle\nSealed, but not air tight.\nStep 2: Make The Mash\nMaking a mash is not always necessary--you can brew a perfectly good lager or ale with prepackaged malt extract. But for this recipe, we're going all out, with an all-grain beer-- we extract the sugars from the grain ourselves. The recipe we're following is for a beer in the Belgian white or \"wit\" sytle. It's called \"Wit Ginger, Not Mary Ann,\" and was published by the esteemed beer-brewing magazine, Zymurgy.\nIngredients:\n11 pounds of grain\n11 quarts of water\nOur grains include 5 pounds Belgian pilsner malt, 4.5 pounds of German wheat malt, 1.0 pound of flaked oats, and 0.5 pounds of caramel pils malt.\nTake the mash (all the ingredients above in a pot) and bring it up to 150 degrees F, keeping it at that exact temperature for 1 hour.\n* Test the mash: The point of mashing is to turn starches in the grain into sugars and extract them into a sweet liquor. After 1 hour, you want to make sure this process has taken place. Take out a spoonful of the water and grain mix and place a drop of iodine in it. The murky brown iodine will change to black in the presence of starch--this means you need to do some more mashing. If there's enough sugar, the color will remain the same.\nAdd the grain for the mash\nAdding the grain (11 pounds) for the mash.\nStir the Mash\nStirring the mash.\nPrepping the Strainer\nWe used rice hulls on the bottom of our DIY strainer--as well as mixed into the mash--to make sure that the grains didn't gum up the works.\nStep 3: Straining and Sparging\nPour the mash into a lauter tun, a big strainer used for separation of the extracted wort, to drain the sweet liquor from the grain. For our budget lauter tun, we drilled 1/8-inch holes into one 5-gallon bucket and placed this strainer on top of another 5-gallon bucket.\nFirst Runnings\nCapture the runoff liquor in your brewpot. This liquor is called the first runnings. Once all the liquor has run off, heat the rest of the water--1/2 gallon per pound of grain at 180 degrees F (according to this recipe)--over the grain in the lauter tun. Again capture the runoff (second runnings) in the brewpot.\nThe sweet liquor in the brewpot is now what's known as a wort, and it's ready to boil.\nStep 4: The Boil\n1/2 teaspoon of ginger\n1 cinnamon stick\nIt's time to raise the wort to a vigorous boil. The boil kills offending bacteria or wild yeast and releases DMS, a chemical byproduct of heating that gives a flavor akin to sweet corn. During this process, watch carefully, as the wort is prone to boil over, resulting in a sticky mess that makes for a tough cleanup.\nAs soon as a boil is reached add the hops to the wort and continue to boil for 60 minutes. Hops added at this point in the process give beer its bitterness, because of the alpha acids that are extracted. Since Belgian wits aren't terribly bitter, our recipe called for just 1 ounce of 4.8 percent alpha-acid Styrian Goldings hops (the higher the percentage of alpha acids the more bitter the hops). In most beer recipes another addition of hops is made 2 to 5 minutes from before the end of the boil to give flavor and aroma. Our recipe forgoes these additions--wheat beers are light on the hop flavor--but it does call for an addition of 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and a cinnamon stick 5 minutes before the end of the boil.\nAdd Cinnamon, Per Recipe\nAdding a cinnamon stick, a special touch of flavor called for in this recipe, in the last 5 minutes of the boil.\nStep 5: Cool The Beer and Pitch The Yeast\nBoiling wort should be cooled as quickly as possible since the cooling period is the time when the beer is most vulnerable to microorganisms present in the air. Cooling can be achieved with a wort chiller, like the one pictured here, or by dipping the brewpot into a sink full of ice water. Do not add ice directly to the beer.\nThe beer should be cooled to 68 degrees F, strained and transferred to a sanitized carboy, where the beer will stay through its first few days of fermentation.\nAffix a blowoff tube to the top of the carboy--the other end of it should be placed under a couple inches of water to seal it from the outside environment while the carbon dioxide escapes. You'll start to see a vigorous fermentation at anywhere from 8 to 26 hours into the process.\nAfter one week, visible fermentation will have subsided and the wort should be transferred (via a siphon) to another sanitized container. Our recipe called for the addition of a vanilla bean at this stage. Two weeks after this transfer the beer should be bottled.\nThe Wort Chiller\nThe wort chiller, pictured here, is attached to the sink and runs cold water through copper tubing to quickly cool down the boil.\nStrain and Transfer the Beer\nHere, we are straining and transferring the beer to a sanitized carboy. Notice the bubbles in the bottle--those are the product of the no-rinse sterilizer.\nProper Coloring of Belgian Wheat\nStraining the beer. After two days this murky brown beer cleared up, looking more like a proper Belgian Wheat.\nSanitize Everything\nFirst things first, everything the beer touches (bucket, siphon, bottling wand, bottles) should be sanitized before you begin the bottling process. Don't slack off here, else your beer could pick up flavors you don't want.\nHospital sterilization isn\u2019t necessary, but it is important to avoid bacteria. You\u2019ll need to clean work surfaces and brewing implements with soap and water. A sanitizer kit such as Star San kills the microbes that change the flavor of your beer. Just pour it on your equipment and wait 30 seconds.\nStep 6: Bottling\nTake 3/4 cup of corn sugar and boil it for 15 minutes in a pint of water. Cool the sugar water and add it to the bottom of a bottling bucket. Then transfer the beer to this bucket. The sugar water gives the yeast something to eat while inside the sealed bottle for a final stage of fermentation, where the beer gets its characteristic bubbles. After two weeks at room temperature, the beer should be fully carbonated and ready to be drink.\nHow to Name Your Beer\nPopular Mechanics\nPick whichever sounds better, your first or last name. Never both. If you\u2019re having a hard time deciding between them, pick the one that the ring announcer at a UFC fight would draw out longer. The easiest option is to simply add the style of beer after that name. If it\u2019s your first name, it gets a possessive (Cameron\u2019s Pale Ale). If it\u2019s your last name, it does not (Johnson Porter).\nIf you\u2019re feeling creative, beer makers love word play (Hopular Mechanics, Augmented Reality).\nFor subsequent batches, add a number at the end.\nHelp!\nBrewshop\nHome-brewers are a talkative and helpful community. If you can, find a home-brew club near you. Home-brew stores will also answer most questions and taste your beers to help you determine where you might have gone wrong. You can also try your local microbrewery. \u201cThere is a blurred line between home-brew and small breweries, so ask them questions,\u201d says LaPolla.\nWhat To Do When Your First Batch Is Terrible\nPhilipp GuellandGetty Images\nMy first batch of beer was intended to be an easy-drinking English-style pale ale. It wasn\u2019t even pale\u2014more of a hazy caramel. The taste was uniformly awful, simultaneously cloyingly sweet and egregiously bitter. And was that a hint of gym socks in the aroma? When a friend asked to try a bottle\u2014it was college, so: free beer!\u2014I tried to blow the aromatic nastiness off the top without his noticing. I was willing to endure the bizarre awkwardness of whistling at his beer for the hope of my dreadful ale tasting a little less vulgar. It barely helped, but we naively drank the whole batch.My beer got better. Yours will too. It always does. I bought fresher ingredients\u2014nothing from a can\u2014and avoided my first-batch pitfalls of fermenting too warm and with unenthusiastic yeast. The next brew was a brown ale that was still too sweet, but mostly palatable, and I didn\u2019t have to blow it a kiss before serving. I smartly followed that by brewing a blond ale with enough fresh ginger to cover all but the most obvious failings. And by my fourth batch, a near-black porter, I had legitimately good beer in my bottles. I\u2019m not sure if my friends cared\u2014or noticed\u2014but I know I did.\u2014Matt Allyn\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\u00a92020 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n"

            "Share this article:\nCulture\nFood\nWhat is beer to the average Singaporean? Probably nothing more than a can of Tiger or a pint of Guinness. At best, many Singaporeans like myself are chin chye [okay with anything] when it comes to the alcoholic beverage.\nWe\u2019re \u201cmore concerned with where the best place is to get a cheap tower\u201d or where we can \u201cfind beer with the highest percentage of alcohol,\u201d says Tay Dao Qian, a beer lover and homebrewer.\nDao Qian is part of a growing pool of Singaporeans who\u2019ve taken to brewing their own beers at home\u2014hence the name \u201chomebrewer\u201d. Despite the commonly held belief that homebrewing is illegal and prone to causing food-poisoning, it is neither.\nHomebrewers, unlike most casual drinkers who see beer as synonymous with alcohol and a means to a (drunken) end, prioritise the quality and flavour of the beer they are consuming.\nFor example, the beers that homebrewer Daryl Yeap brews at home are centered around the concept of maximum taste with minimum alcohol\u2014achieving such a balance will allow him to drink more good quality beer without the side effects of getting drunk.\n\u201cThis is a concept that is very foreign to those who drink a lot of commercial, flavourless beers.\u201d\nFreedom may be a myth here in Singapore, but in the kitchens of homebrewers, it is a reality\u2014if only for 6 hours. (This is how long it takes to brew beer from scratch, excluding another 1 to 2 weeks of waiting for the yeast in the beer to ferment before it is drinkable.)\nWhen it comes to homebrewing, there are no rules.\nUnlike with wines and spirits, \u201cThere are no traditions to satisfy or restrictions of what people perceive when it comes to beer,\u201d says Kai Han, a long-time homebrewer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about experimenting and satisfying yourself.\u201d\nThe allure of homebrewing lies in its ability to provide a rare avenue for Singaporeans to get creative and push the limits with their concoctions\u2014whether it\u2019s with flavours (Kai Han has tasted beers made with durian, cheese and herbs), or with different techniques of fermentation and processing.\nThe added benefit is that while the rest of us low-SES folk are restricted to what beer our local NTUC carries, they are not. Dao Qian has brewed an award-winning Hojicha beer while Daryl lets me sample a mango and passionfruit brew he\u2019s made.\nNaturally, their skill and easy access to good beer has gone towards making them quite popular amongst their friends.\n\u201cIt gets you bragging rights,\u201d says Nick, a former moderator of the Singapore Homebrew Club, \u201cPeople like that you can brew your own beer and are always coming round for a drink.\u201d\nDao Qian conducting a workshop for beginner homebrewers at the Homebrew Co-op. Class sizes have grown significantly since the workshops began some 4 years ago with more locals and females attending as well.\nBut while there are definite perks, homebrewing is far from being a hobby for the masses.\nFor starters, it\u2019s tedious work. Brewers are locked in a furious battle against bacteria which can easily spoil one\u2019s beer, and everything has to be sanitised and cleaned religiously before brewing can commence.\nIt\u2019s also capital and space intensive. For beer (usually made in large quantities of between 20 to 30 litres) to ferment, it has to maintain a temperature between 18 C and 24 C. As such, homebrewers such as Dao Qian have taken to purchasing as many as 3 extra fridges to store their beer at home.\nLastly, beer is a risky endeavour. Homebrewed or not, require at least 2 weeks of waiting around before it is ready. If after two weeks the beer turns out to be bad, it would\u2019ve been a colossal waste of time, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\nThese factors not only make one reluctant to even start homebrewing, they also contribute to a high attrition rate.\nNevertheless, those who press on are rewarded.\n\u201cComparing the final product to something commercial and realising that you can match it or even exceed it makes all the hours and effort worth it,\u201d insists Kai Han.\nIt\u2019s clear then for these homebrewers are doing what they do for the love of beer and out of a desire to push the envelope. If they were like us and just looking for a quick alcohol fix, there are surely simpler ways.\nA beer tap in Nick's home.\nBeer kegs in Nick's home.\nWhen I first came to know of homebrewers, I expected them to be beer snobs.\nI assumed that by virtue of being able to brew their own beer at home, they would have no reason to drink \u201cflavourless\u201d commercial beers like Heineken or to even pay $14 for a bottle of better quality craft beer.\nIt also didn\u2019t help when John Wei, homebrewer and head brewer of Brewlander & Co, told me that he believes Singapore\u2019s quality of homebrew is so good that it surpasses that of some microbreweries here and elsewhere.\nNot only do homebrewers regularly drink outside to get inspiration and ideas for their own creations, they also see drinking as a social activity, though not quite in the same way most regular drinkers do.\nWhile we may consume beer to get high, drunk or to enable us to communicate more effectively with each other, homebrewers see beer as a different social tool.\nNatasha, Nick\u2019s wife and fellow ex-moderator of the Singapore Homebrew Club, shares that her favourite spot to drink is at Smith Street Taps. Nestled away on the second floor of Chinatown Complex, she can always count on finding a \u201cbeer geek who\u2019s nice to chat with\u201d at Smith Street Taps.\nUnlike how we often share our hawker tables begrudgingly with strangers, Natasha always looks forward to striking up a conversation with the people she\u2019s sitting with\u2014the topic of choice being beer of course.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll chat over what beer they\u2019re drinking, what beer they would recommend, where they like to drink and what they like to brew,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBeer is one of the great equalisers, you can just talk to anyone over it.\u201d\nAt the same time, as someone who\u2019s not knowledgeable about beer at all, the thought of sitting down with a beer geek-enthusiast-connoisseur sounds incredibly intimidating. I estimate it would take only minutes before I begin to feel grossly out of my depth.\nBrewlander, John Wei's brand of beers sold in Singapore cafes and craft beer stores.\nNone of this changes the fact that homebrewing is booming in Singapore.\nFrom John\u2019s observations, the number of participants in the annual iBrew Challenge, Singapore\u2019s main homebrew event, has grown significantly over the years. Where two to three hundred people used to join, now he sees anywhere from four hundred to seven hundred people.\nThe main problem however, lies in the stagnation of Singapore\u2019s craft beer industry.\nWhen craft beer first took off about a decade ago, we were on good footing. Singapore had around 10 to 15 microbreweries and craft beer stores. We were essentially the pioneers of craft brewing in the region.\nTen years later, we still have the same few stores we did back then, with few newcomers.\nAccording to John, countries like Vietnam, Hong Kong and Thailand that just 4 years ago had only 2 to 3 breweries, now have two or three times our number.\nTheir growth is even more phenomenal given the fact that craft beer in those countries can cost significantly more ($5 to $7) than local beer brands (50 cents to a dollar).\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m told that a bar in Singapore can charge anywhere from $10 to $12 for a Tiger while craft beers only cost $2 to $3 more.\nThe movement is further dampened by less than noble craft beer distributors just looking to make a quick buck. According to Daryl, while there are distributors who do it out of a genuine love and passion for beers and who want to share it with others, there are also those who just want to capitalise on the movement.\n\u201cThey bring in very average beers from other countries and market it as life changing.\u201d\nThen again, most of us probably can\u2019t tell the difference\u2014many of the homebrewers I speak to are of the opinion that Singaporeans aren\u2019t discerning when it comes to beer.\nThe fact of the matter is, we just don\u2019t have a widespread culture of drinking in the same way that say, European countries do. Most of us only care about drinking what is in fashion, what can be easily found, or what is cheaply priced.\nOur ignorance towards beer\u2014homebrewed or otherwise\u2014is probably one of the few downsides to being such a food-centric country. With all our focus being on the \u201cF\u201d in \u201cF&B\u201d, it\u2019s little wonder why our beverages get the short end of the stick.\nAt best, John estimates that only 1% of Singapore\u2019s beer consumption comes from craft beer. \u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go before saturation.\u201d\nEven if the recent growth in the number of homebrewers adds a much needed boost to Singapore\u2019s craft beer industry, it seems that beer, for the foreseeable future, will remain very much a niche sector for now.\nIf reading this article makes you want to crack open a cold one, we\u2019d love to know.

            "Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn money if you buy from a link. How we test gear.\nIndoor Gardening: How To Start Growing Your Own Vegetables Inside the House\nWe ask a longtime garden expert for her top tips for successful seedlings. There's no time like the present to get growing.\nPeopleImagesGetty Images\nIf you just can't wait for warmer weather to start gardening again, fear not. Indoor gardening is a good way to save money and get a head start on your summer garden. We asked a longtime gardening expert for her best tips.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nWestend61Getty Images\nIt's still chilly outside, and some of us continue to face the threat of winter storms. But spring is almost here, and now is the perfect time to plant seeds and start growing your garden indoors.\nIndoor gardening is more than just a great hobby to pass the last few chilly weeks before summer. By starting plants inside, you can get a jump on the summer growing season\u2014and be the first one in town with fresh veggies and blooming flowers when the hot weather arrives.\n2 Choose Your Plants and Buy the Seeds\nHome and garden centers sell plenty of seeds. But Melinda Myers, a Milwaukee\u2013based gardener and author of more than 20 horticulture books, says you'll get a wider selection of plants with online or mail orders .\n\"Some lesser known or less popular plants, or newer varieties, aren't available yet in stores, so you have to start with seeds,\" she says. And with seeds, you can get what you want. Myers says gardeners should take advantage of online or mail order by buying something unique rather than buying easy-to-find radishes or roses that every home center carries.\nSeeds are less expensive than plants, so you'll save money, but the package may contain more seeds than you need. In that case, Myers says, save some for next year. Or, plant them all and swap seedlings with friends when it's time to transplant them outdoors.\n3 Make, Buy, or Reuse Containers\nWhen you grow seeds indoors, any number of items can make good containers. Empty yogurt cups are the perfect size\u2014about 2 inches square by 2 to 3 inches deep. Myers also likes to loosely wrap newspaper around a 2\u00bd-inch-thick dowel, press the lower ends of the paper together to create a bottom, then remove the rod and fill the newspaper cup with potting mix. This makes transplanting easy because the entire paper container is biodegradable, so it can be placed in the garden. \"It's a way to recycle and reuse,\" she explains. Just be sure to use a container that lets excess water drain out. If roots sit in excess water, they rot. So cut holes in containers if they don't already have them.\nReusing containers that you bought flowers in last year also works great, but clean them first to kill any bacteria or disease that can harm seedlings. Mix one part bleach with nine parts water, and dip the container into the solution. Then dunk or rinse the container with water. \"This disinfects for diseases, so you're starting with something clean,\" Myers says.\nMyers also likes CowPots , which, as the name suggests, are containers made from composted cow manure. Like newspaper containers, they can go in the outdoor garden when it's time to transplant.\n4 Dedicate an Indoor Garden Location\nPick a convenient spot in the house for the garden. When the seeds are first planted, heat is more important than light. Myers says you can start the seeds in a warm location that doesn't have to be lit. But once the seedlings break through the soil, they need light.\nYou can start seeds in a basement corner or even in front of a large window that lets in lots of sun for warmth. If the window is drafty, though, pick another spot\u2014seeds and bulbs do best in warm soil. When the seedlings are visible, you can move them to a bright location under artificial lights. Or, better yet, a spot that receives sunlight as well as artificial light.\n5 Prep the Soil and Plant the Seeds\u2014When the Time is Right\nPreparing the perfect soil is much easier for indoor gardens than their outdoor counterparts because you're dealing with a lot less space. Use a seed-starting or sterile potting mix right out of the bag.\nMost seed packages tell you what time of the year to plant them based on your region or the average last spring frost. If you're not sure, ask a local gardener. It is possible to start too soon\u2014if plants grow too large indoors, they get stressed when they're transplanted. But if you start too late, the seedlings don't mature enough indoors.\nLikewise, once your plants are growing, don't transplant them outside too early. \"We're all anxious to get started, but if you move outside too early and get a frost or the soil is too cold, all of that work you did is lost because the soil isn't warm enough,\" Myers says.\n6 Water Wisely\nThe trickiest part of indoor gardening is giving the plants the right amount of water, without over-watering. \"It's almost impossible to water correctly, so drainage holes in your containers are critical,\" Myers says, adding that she sometimes uses a mist bottle to water newly planted seeds. \"You want enough water to moisten the soil without washing out the seed.\"\nCheck the soil moisture daily. \"You want the soil about the consistency of a sponge that's been wrung out,\" she says. Sticking your finger into the soil is a quick way to tell if it's getting enough water. It should be moist all the way through so that roots will go downward. Covering the container with damp newspaper or plastic holds in warmth and moisture, but remove the cover once the plants break through the soil.\n7 Light It Up\nEven plants that receive natural sunlight benefit from cool and warm fluorescent lights. \"You have the best results if you supplement your natural sunlight with light from a bulb,\" Myers says. \"This gives you a full spectrum of light.\" She recommends full-spectrum CFLs and LEDs for more energy-efficient artificial lighting.\nPlace artificial lights 6 inches over the plants. \"Either lower the containers as the plants grow, or raise the lights,\" Myers says. \"That's why gardeners often have their lights on chains.\"\nHardcore gardeners place aluminum foil or whiteboard on the surfaces around containers to reflect light, Myers says. \"This lets you maximize the light by reflecting it back toward the seedlings.\"\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\u00a92020 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

            "Do With Your Money?\nExplore\nName*\nEmail*\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\nBy\nHave you ever thought about starting a home garden?\nWith food prices rising and more people trying to save money due to the economy, home gardening has taken off in a big way in recent years. Many vegetable seed companies report sales have shot up 30-50%, which is a clear indicator that more people are putting on their gardening gloves and getting to work.\nHome gardening is a hobby that can bring great joy to your life, enable you to get some free exercise, and bring the entire family together. Although it may not sound exciting on the surface, it\u2019s something you should consider if you enjoy the outdoors and are interested in reaping the rewards of hard work.\nBenefits of Home Gardening\nSo, still wondering if home gardening is right for you? Wondering if a home garden can really save you money? First, let\u2019s look at the benefits of starting a home garden.\n1. Home Gardening Is Versatile\nSome people think they need a huge yard to have their own garden, but nothing could be further from the truth. No matter how much space you have, you can always find room for a few plants. This is true even if you live in an apartment or only have a small porch. All you need is a DIY attitude and a bit of creativity.\nCase in point: you\u2019d laugh if you saw my backyard. Its picture is next to the word \u201ctiny\u201d in the dictionary. But last year I grew a bumper crop of tomatoes, climbing peas, and several other wonderful veggies in my little space \u2013 all using some creative techniques I\u2019ll talk about in just a bit.\nSo, don\u2019t think that because you don\u2019t have a ton of space you can\u2019t grow a garden. Home gardening can be really versatile, and easy to get into!\n2. Home Gardening Relieves Stress\nI find gardening to be a very soothing hobby. Digging in the dirt and watching my veggies grow a bit every day is incredibly rewarding.\nGardening is a wonderful activity to relieve stress. You\u2019re outdoors, you\u2019re getting exercise, and best of all, the activity often takes your mind off work and other stress in your life. I know it does for me!\n3. Home Gardening Is a Family Activity\nFor some, gardening is a solo activity. But this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. Why not ask your spouse and/or children to give you a hand in the garden? You may be surprised by how much fun you can all have together. Finding fun activities for the whole family to participate in can be tough and we often resort to spending a bunch of money to have fun, but working in a garden together costs nothing.\nAnother thing to consider is that due to steep budget cuts, more and more cities are closing their community pools and cutting public library services and resources . If you and your kids rely on city perks like these for your summer fun, you might be twiddling your thumbs this year. I know several pools in my own community won\u2019t be open, and my local library is cutting back their hours to try and save money.\nYour kids might love helping you grow veggies in the garden, so this can be an inexpensive alternative to consider.\n4. Home Gardens Save Money\nFor many people, this is the number one reason to start a garden. Burpee Seed Co. estimates that for every $50 a family spends on seeds and fertilizer, they\u2019ll reap $1,250 in produce. Amazing!\nIf saving money on fruits and vegetables is your end goal, make sure you plant seeds for things you\u2019ll actually enjoy eating. Some of the most popular options include tomatoes, green peppers, banana peppers, and zucchini.\nI\u2019ve never estimated how much money I save with my own garden. My first year starting seeds I lost my entire crop because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and overwatered. Last year, I lost half my crop and had to start over. So there will most likely be failures and successes, but that\u2019s part of the fun.\nHowever, you can maximize the money you save by being smart about what you grow.\u00a0For instance, cool weather crops like carrots, potatoes, onions, and winter squash can be stored for quite a long time. When these vegetables are harvested, you can easily store them in your basement for several weeks, or even months, if you keep them packed in sawdust. So even if you can\u2019t eat them right away, they\u2019ll keep long enough for you to use them up over time.\nOther vegetables, like tomatoes, peas, cucumbers, and beets are easy to preserve with home canning or freezing.\nA good rule of thumb is to look at the vegetables you\u2019re buying at the store already. For instance, I eat a ton of kale and spinach, so these are two crops I always try to grow at home. I also love green beans, so every year I make my own homemade Dilly Beans, and can them myself.\n5. You Can Grow Your Own Herbs and Spices\nYou probably already know that herbs are really expensive to buy in the store. Growing rosemary, basil, oregano, and other herbs and spices in your garden is a great way to save some money and diversify your crop.\nHerbs are usually my biggest crop every year, and I always find a use for what I grow.\nFor instance, I have several lavender bushes in my yard. I dry the lavender, make lavender infused olive oil and\u00a0lavender shortbread cookies, and even sprinkle dried lavender in my carpets. I\u2019m also getting into soapmaking (a great green small business idea ), so I\u2019ll have plenty of lavender to use in my homemade soaps.\nI also grow a lot of parsley, which I sprinkle on potatoes and use to make homemade tabbouleh.\nKeep in mind that even if you can\u2019t use your herbs fresh right now, you can always dry them and use them over the next several months. This can save you money because you won\u2019t need to buy these dried herbs at the grocery store.\n6. Home Gardens Are Green and Sustainable\nBuying natural organic food is expensive, but often desired due to all of the chemicals and genetic altering done by farmers nowadays. Growing your own fruits and vegetables is the most organic you can get! You\u2019ll be helping the environment and saving money at the same time.\nYou can also save money and help your garden be more organic by creating your own compost at home. For instance, I have my own vermicomposting bin, which means I compost my food scraps with worms. It may sound gross, but worms are amazing at breaking down food and turning it into thick, rich compost.\nThis compost is very expensive if you buy it at the store. The same is true for liquid fertilizer, which my worms also produce for me. The best part is that, for me, these garden essentials are 100% free, and I\u2019m lessening my impact on the environment by keeping all my food waste out of the landfill.\nHow to Start a Home Garden\nIf you\u2019ve never started a garden, you might be tempted to run out to Home Depot and buy a ton of seeds, dirt, and fertilizer.\nLet me say this now: don\u2019t do it. At least, not yet. There are cheaper ways to get into home gardening!\nStep 1: Look at Your Sun Availability\nFirst, look at your yard. Where do you get the most sun? How much sun does each area get?\nOne of my biggest mistakes when I started gardening was assuming that my garden needed 8 hours of sun every day. Thanks to my partly shady yard, this kept me from gardening for many years. But the truth is that many vegetables grow very well in part shade; that is, if they get at least 3 hours of sun, or consistent dappled sun, throughout the day.\nWhat grows well in part shade? Here\u2019s a list of 10 types of vegetables to get you started:\nSalad Greens, such as leaf lettuce, arugula, endive, and cress.\nBroccoli\nCauliflower\nPeas\nBeets\nLeafy Greens, such as collards, mustard greens, spinach, and kale\nBeans\nThese 6 vegetables, on the other hand, grow best in full sun:\nTomatoes\nPotatoes\nEggplant\nPeppers\nSquash\nCorn\nYou can save money on your vegetables by purchasing them from independent farmers and nurseries, or starting seeds yourself. Big chain stores like Home Depot and Lowes usually have the most expensive prices on these plants.\nStep 2: Look at Your Space\nNow look at the land or space you have to work with. Remember, you don\u2019t need a lot of space to grow a garden!\nIf you\u2019re working with limited space (like me), then you\u2019ll want to consider two options: container gardening, and vertical gardening.\nContainer Gardening\nThanks to my tiny backyard, I have to think small. So I always use container gardening. I have pots of tomatoes and herbs sitting on my back patio right now. And, they\u2019re doing great!\nYou can save a lot of money on your containers by shopping at garage sales . And, don\u2019t limit your search to traditional terra cotta pots! For instance, you can grow herbs and greens in chipped teapots and vintage olive oil cans (as long as you put sand or stones at the bottom for drainage). These containers can be picked up for a song at garage sales or thrift stores, and have a lot more character than traditional terra cotta pots or plastic pots!\nVertical Gardening\nI also go vertical; instead of planting a garden out (like a traditional garden in the ground, which requires far more land), I go up.\nFor instance, you can attach rain gutters to the side of your house and plant shallow crops, like lettuce and herbs, in them. You can use canvas hanging shoe organizers off your patio for shallow crops \u2013 for instructions, check out how it\u2019s done .\u00a0You can build outdoor shelving and have several layers of pots on your deck. You can use your backyard fence to grow climbing veggies like peas and cucumbers.\nThere are tons of creative (and frugal) ways to plant fruits and vegetables in your yard. And, going vertical is a great option if you don\u2019t have a lot of space.\nIf you do have some extra land to work with, you\u2019ll be able to plant your veggies right in the ground. You\u2019ll first need to rip up the grass (or whatever plants are currently growing there) and till the soil, making it nice and loose for the vegetables you\u2019ll be planting.\nYou\u2019ll probably also want to put up some kind of fencing to keep rabbits, squirrels, and deer out. This doesn\u2019t have to be expensive; even chicken wire will work.\nStep 3: Consider Your Watering Needs\nHow are you going to water your garden? Is the site you\u2019ve selected easily accessed by your water hose?\nIt\u2019s important to analyze how you\u2019re going to water your garden before you plant it. And, now is a good time to seriously consider investing in a rain barrel. I have two, and they are essential in the summer months for keeping my garden well watered.\nStep 4: Plant Your Garden\nOnce you\u2019ve analyzed your light, selected a site, and prepared the garden, you can now start planting!\nMake sure you give your plants a drink of water before you stick them in the garden; this wets the root ball and makes it less likely they\u2019ll go into shock when you transplant them.\nYour garden will likely need water at least twice a week. Of course, this depends on how much rain you get, and what you\u2019ve planted. Research the plants you\u2019re growing so you\u2019re informed on how much water they need. As a rule, it\u2019s best to water either early in the morning or later in the evening; watering during the afternoon can actually burn your plants.\nMore Home Gardening Tips:\nTry starting seeds from scratch rather than buying established plants from a store. You\u2019ll save a ton of money this way, although this does require more work.\nDon\u2019t waste money buying peat pots or other seed starting kits. Check with your local nursery; they likely have a ton of black plastic pots and plant trays they\u2019d be happy to give you. You can also use egg cartons and plastic cups to start seeds in (that\u2019s what I use).\nVisit your local farmers\u2019 market to look for fruit and veggie plants. You\u2019ll not only support families instead of a big corporate store, but you\u2019ll also save a ton of money. For instance, I can buy a basil plant at Home Depot for $3.50, or buy the same plant at my local farmers\u2019 market for just $1.\nDon\u2019t waste money buying garden labels (i.e. the plastic spikes you write on and then stick into the ground to identify your plants). Cut up a plastic milk carton and use a black Sharpie instead!\nIf you have a problem with birds and rodents eating your veggies, cut up an old garden hose into three or four feet segments. Animals will often mistake these for snakes, and steer clear of your garden. You could even get your kids involved by having them paint the hoses to look even more like snakes.\nFinal Word\nDo any of you have your own garden?

            "Age-Old Wisdom meets Modern\u00a0Tools\nVegetable Gardening for\u00a0Beginners\nWhy garden, you ask?\u00a0If you\u2019ve never tasted garden-fresh vegetables (lots of people haven\u2019t!), you will be amazed by the sweet, juicy flavors and vibrant textures. There\u2019s absolutely nothing quite like fresh veggies, especially if you grow them yourself\u2014which you\u00a0can!\nOn this page, we\u2019ll highlight the basics of vegetable gardening and planning: how to pick the right site for your garden, how to create the right size garden, and how to select which vegetables to\u00a0grow.\nPick the Right\u00a0Location\nPicking a good location for your garden is absolutely key. A sub-par location can result in sub-par veggies! Here are a few tips for choosing a good\u00a0site:\nPlant in a sunny location. Most vegetables need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per\u00a0day. There are a few veggies that will tolerate some\u00a0shade.\nPlant in moist, well-drained soil. If you have poorly drained soil (water pools), plant veggies in a raised bed. If you have rocky soil, till and remove the\u00a0rocks.\nPlant in a stable environment. Avoid places that receive\u00a0strong winds could knock over your young plants or keep pollinators from doing their job. Nor do you want to plant in a location that receives too much foot traffic or floods easily. Plant in a location that would make\u00a0Goldilocks\u00a0proud.\nChoosing a Plot Size: Start\u00a0Small!\nRemember: It\u2019s better to be proud of a small garden than be frustrated by a big\u00a0one!\nOne of the most common errors that beginners make is planting too much too soon\u2014way more than anybody could ever eat or want!\u00a0Unless you want to have zucchini taking up residence in your attic, plan your garden with care. Start small, and only grow what you know you\u2019ll\u00a0eat.\nHere are some tips for a good-size beginner vegetable garden that can feed a family of four for one summer, with a little leftover for canning and freezing (or giving away to jealous\u00a0neighbors).\nMake your garden 11 rows wide, with each row 10 feet long.\u00a0The rows should run north and south to take full advantage of the\u00a0sun.\nMake sure that you have paths that allow you to access your plants to weed and harvest. The general rule is: Don\u2019t allow more than four feet of plants without access to them. Just makek sure that you can reach the center of the row or bed\u00a0easily.\n(Note: If this garden is too large for your needs, you do not have to plant all 11 rows, or you can simply make the rows\u00a0shorter.)\nChoosing\u00a0Vegetables!\nThe vegetables suggested below are common, productive plants that are relatively easy to grow.\u00a0It would be wise to contact\u00a0your\u00a0state\u2019s Cooperative Extension Service to find out what plants grow best in your\u00a0area.\nTop Ten Vegetables\n(Tip: Click on a veggie\u2019s name to see its detailed\u00a0Growing\u00a0Guide.)\nSome guidelines to choosing\u00a0vegetables:\nChoose what you (and your family) like to eat.\u00a0If no one likes Brussels sprouts, don\u2019t plant\u00a0them!\nBe realistic about how many vegetables your family will eat. Be careful not to overplant. (Of course, you could always give your veggies\u00a0away.)\nConsider the availability of veggies at your grocery store. Maybe you want to grow tomatillo, instead of cabbage or carrots which are\u00a0available. Also, certain veggies are so far superior when home-grown, it\u2019s almost a shame not to consider (we\u2019re thinking of garden lettuce and tomatoes!). Also, home-grown herbs are far less expensive than grocery store\u00a0herbs.\nSummer vacation?\u00a0Remember that tomatos and zucchinis are growing in the middle of summer. If you\u2019re gone part of the summer, you need someone to look after the drops or they will suffer. Or, you could just plant cool-season crops such as lettuce and kale and root\u00a0veggies.\nUse high-quality seeds. Seed packets are less expensive than individual plants, but if seeds don\u2019t germinate, your money\u2014and time\u2014are wasted. A few extra\u00a0cents spent in spring for that year\u2019s seeds will pay off in higher yields at harvesttime. If you plan ahead, buying straight from the nursery seedsmen is cheaper and higher-quality. See\u00a0a list of of mail-order seed catalogs\u00a0here\nWhere and When to\u00a0Plant?\nIf you are simply growing two or three tomato plants, this process is easy. But if you plant to grow a full garden, you need to\u00a0consider:\nWhere each vegetable will\u00a0go?\nWhen each vegetable needs to be\u00a0planted.\nHere are a few guidelines to arranging your\u00a0vegetables:\nThere are \u201ccool-season\u201d veggies that grow in spring (eq, lettuce, spinach, root veggies) and \u201cwarm-season\u201d veggies that aren\u2019t planted until the soil warms up (eq, tomatoes, peppers).\u00a0Plant cool-season crops after spring frost and then plant warm-season crops in the same area later in the\u00a0season.\nPlant tall veggies (such as pole beans or a trellis or sweet corn) on the north side of the garden so they don\u2019t shade shorter plants.\u00a0If you do get shade in a part of your garden, save that area for small cool-season\u00a0veggies.\u00a0If shade is unavoidable in parts of your garden, save those areas for cool-season vegetables which\u00a0appreciate shade as the weather heats\u00a0up.\nMost veggies are annuals (planted each year). If you\u2019re planning on \u201cperennial\u201d crops such as asparagus, rhubarb, and some herbs, provide permenant locations or\u00a0beds\nConsider that some crops mature quickly and have a very short harvest period (radishes, bush beans). Other plants, such as tomatoes, have a longer period of time. These \u201cdays to maturity\u201d are on the seed packet.\u00a0Vegetables that may yield more than one crop per season include beans , beets , carrots , cabbage , kohlrabi, lettuce , radishes , rutabagas , spinach , and turnips .\nStagger plantings. You don\u2019t want plant all your lettuce seeds at the same time or all that lettuce needs to be harvested around the same time! Stagger plantings by a few weeks to keep \u2018em\u00a0coming!\nWhen to plant\u00a0what?\nEvery region has a different planting time based mainly on their weather, and every vegetable has its temperature preferences, too.

Zucchini's were few, tomato plants tall and lanky with few fruits, peppers stunted, and my seedless grapes (not in raised beds) came out with tough skins. What am I doing wrong?\nbig disappointment\nSeptember 20, 2018 - 3:42pm\nHi, Sandy, Oh, my, this is hard to hear. I am going to assume that the bed is in a place that get at least (but ideally more than) 6 hours of direct sun per day. Oddly enough, I was working on a project today about soil nutrients, which, despite what sounds like your ideal set up, could possibly have been missing. On this page (see link, next), N-P-K is addressed and it suggests that lack of potassium can lead to stunted growth: https://www.almanac.com/content/npk-ratio-what-do-numbers-fertilizer-mean\nContinue reading about calcium, magnesium, and\u00a0sulfur.\nAnd then there is pH (acidity) to consider. Even with the proper soil, improper pH values can hinder plant growth. See here: https://www.almanac.com/content/preparing-soil-planting and then see the chart for all (common) plants here https://www.almanac.com/content/soil-ph-levels\nWe hope this does not deter you from trying again next year!

Literally over night. I sprayed it yesterday with an organic pesticide and my daughter found several little black (almost microscopic) bigs still eating it today. How do I get rid of the bugs? What are they? How do I prevent?\nGarden bugs\nSubmitted by Ron on\nMarch 14, 2019 - 8:24pm\nTo get rid of undesirable garden bugs, try 20% vinager from a spray bottle. This is not the weaker type vinigar ound in the grocery. A good garden or chemical supply will have it.\nAlso you might want to put the area with Diatomaceous Earth. While it looks like powder and is safe to use around  children and pests, to crawling insects it is like a phalanx of Spartan soldiers .\nI find more natral things like this  far better than chemicals.\nShade Vegetables\nJuly 14, 2018 - 9:42pm\nAlong the south facing wall of my house I have planted dwarf citrus trees - they get lots of sun and are growing well.  6 feet from the house is a solid wood fence - the side of the fence facing the house is always in the shade, but warm due to reflected heat from the house.  What do you recommend that I plant along the base of the wall, knowing that it will not get any direct sunlight?\nShade Vegetables\nJuly 18, 2018 - 3:26pm\nMost veggies need at least partial shade to produce a worthwhile crop. Your best bet would be to try leafy greens, like lettuce, arugula, spinach, or Swiss chard. If the area is completely shaded though, you may not have much luck with veggies. Perhaps a\u00a0fern garden would be a nice\u00a0addition?\nI live in Ecuador, can this Garden Planner understand my area?\nSubmitted by David Sturm on\nMarch 2, 2018 - 5:54am\nGood day all,\nThis Garden Planner sounds wonderful and would like to utilize it but moved down from a wonderful growing area in Roswell, GA to the high Andes Mountains with an arid elevation of 8,200. I learned that I needed to import Top Soil(compost) and remove the clay soil that I have in order to grow my heirloom tomatoes, sweet corn etc.I was wondering if this Garden Planner has any adjustments to allow me to adjust to a reverse growing season( plus I can't grow Blueberries, as there is no winter here :(  )\nIt the Garden Planner doesn't does anyone know of a website that they can direct me to on growing in this type of climate?\nThank you for reading this.\ngarden planner is global\nMarch 2, 2018 - 12:00pm\nYes, our\u00a0garden planner works anywhere! The caveats to this is that we have detailed weather information/climate data for the US, Canada, all of Europe, Australia and South Africa. For other countries, once a user has set their location, we advise them to check and adjust their frost dates to make sure that the system\u2019s calculated planting calendar will be as accurate as\u00a0possible.\nEcuador\nSubmitted by Ron on\nMarch 14, 2019 - 8:43pm\nHi David.  I am in Costa Rica. We have simularities of climate and geology when it comes to gardenin. One of those is volcanic soils lack iron.. If you can get iron filings that would take care of that problem.\nSorry I don't think blueberries will grow well. At least not below 4500 or more feet elevation. They need some cold weather but not necessarily freezing, but definitely below 45 F. On the other hand blackberries should grow well. Get the seeds from the fruit hopefully found in a grocery store.\nReversing seasons won't help. We are both too close the Equator ans other than rainy and dry season, temperatures and daytime don't change much. I have had many things fail. Sometimes planting seeds that remain dormant about two months, grow a short spurt and die.  I am closing in on this problem by planting seeds every two weeks. I am certain there is something about the timing but not temperature, length of day nor even rain (after all, the garden hose resolves that problem)\nI live at an altitude of 5100 feet in the  same place the best and most expensive coffee grows. Tarrazu Costa Rica. I know manycoffee farmers and much of what I am doing is to get ather crops growing  between and under the coffee trees.  I think tall plants like sunflowers and perhaps Okra.   I would also like to get Hops growing. Used in beer brewing and labor intensive. There is a world wide  shortage of Hops.  I would think Ecuador would be perfect again above 4500 foot elevation. At that altitude, I believe Ecuador would be much like Oregon and parts of Northern California. It snows and freezes but not much. I have seen citrus trees and palm trees growing as ar north as Eugene Oregon.\nSweet potatos\nFebruary 28, 2018 - 5:50pm\nWhen is the right time to plant sweet potato's?

            "Jessica Morelock, Leaf Group\nThe Philippines is home to a number of endemic species of orchids.\n(Photo: Thinkstock/Comstock/Getty Images )\nDestinations\nThe Sierra Madre Mountains found on the island of Luzon are home to the largest track of virgin jungle in the Philippines, constituting approximately 40 percent of the country's total forest cover. The remainder of tropical rain forest in the Philippines is found on the islands of Mindanao and Palawan. Eastern Mindanao is home to the Philippines' highest peak, Mt. Apo, and most of its jungle is mountainous. Palawan, the Philippines' largest province, has retained approximately 50 percent of its original jungle, which includes both lowland and highland areas.\nFlora and Fauna\nTaking a jungle vacation in the Philippines will allow you to connect with the rich and exotic flora and fauna of the country's rain forests. The Philippines is home to more than 9,000 plant species, of which approximately 65 percent are endemic. Endemic plant species include varieties of ginger, orchid, pandan and palm. More than 60 percent of the 167 species of mammals in the Philippines are endemic and include interesting creatures such as the tamaraw, a dwarf water buffalo; spotted deer; and warty pigs. If you plan to bird-watch during your jungle vacation, the more than 175 native bird species include creepers or Philippine eagles.\nActivities\nThe diverse landscapes of the Philippines gives you the opportunity to participate in many outdoor activities during your jungle vacation. Consider biking through the forested areas of the Philippines, which will give you the opportunity to explore the jungle in areas where vehicles do not travel. If you visit Mindanao, consider kayaking or white-water rafting through the jungle on one of its rivers.\nPreserved Areas\nTo observe endangered flora and fauna of the Philippines, visit one of the preserved areas of rain forest within the country. The Mt. Hilong and Hilong Range area of Eastern Mindanao is the largest tract of remaining dipterocarp forest in the Philippines, and it is home to almost 50 endangered wildlife species, including magkono, or Philippine iron wood. The Mt. Mantalingahan Protected Landscape in southern Palawan is home to most of the threatened bird species on the island. The Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park of Luzon, the largest protected area in the Philippines, is home to 78 bird species found nowhere else in the Philippines, including the Isabela oriole, one of the rarest birds on Earth.\nTours\nAlthough you can explore the jungles of the Philippines independently, you may find taking an organized tour more to your liking. Subic Bay, a former U.S. military base on Luzon Island, is home to a variety of tour companies offering treks and overnights in the rain forest. Visit JEST Camp, or \"Jungle Environmental Survival Training,\" where you can take a jungle tour that teaches you about food sources, fire and life in the rain forest. The Subic area also offers tours of the Pamulaklakin Forest Trail that can last for two hours, or, for the brave, overnight. Guests on Pamulaklakin Forest Trail tours will learn survival techniques such as building fires and catching animals.\nDisclosure\nLeaf Group is a USA TODAY content partner providing general travel information.

            "4 April 2017\nLocated in the far northwest of Singapore, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is haven for wildlife. With tidal ponds and mangrove forests, it supports an ecosystem of birds, reptiles and mammals. At the same time, it provides visitors a chance to encounter and admire these animals in their natural habitat.\nSome of the animals that visitors come to see at\u00a0Sungei Buloh\u2019s\u00a0Tidal Ponds include herons, kingfishers, monitor lizards and water snakes.\nSungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a sanctuary for many different species of birds.\nThe most popular time of the year\u00a0to\u00a0visit\u00a0is from September to March. This is when migratory birds such as the Great Egret, Marsh Sandpiper and Himalayan Swiftlet fly into the wetlands at Sungei Buloh.\nFor human visitors, the entry to the wetlands at Sungei Buloh is much\u00a0less dramatic.\nMake your way to the Buloh Tidal Ponds through the Sungei Buloh Wetland Centre.\nThe first building visitors heading to the Tidal Ponds will come to is the Wetland Centre. This should not be confused with the Visitor Centre that is located at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Extension .\nAt the Wetland Centre, there are educational panels that provide a wealth of information about the flora and fauna of the wetland reserve.\nSungei Buloh and its tidal ponds became a nature reserve in 2002. The new Sungei Buloh Wetland Extension , with coastal walks and a mudflat experience , was later added in December 2014.\nView of the Buloh Tidal Ponds\nFrom the Wetland Centre, a\u00a0bridge that connects to the wetlands or tidal ponds. The bridge spans the Buloh Besar river and visitors will need to head past decorated corrugated metal hoardings to\u00a0arrive\u00a0at\u00a0the Tidal Ponds.\nSungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and its Tidal Ponds\nThe Buloh Tidal Ponds have\u00a0a\u00a0raised, paved track that runs around its\u00a0perimeter. This track, the Migratory Bird Trail is 1.95 km long. You can think of it as an oval, starting from the main bridge and with\u00a0the\u00a0ponds\u00a0at\u00a0the very middle.\nLooking out from the Main Hide at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve\nAlong the trail, there are five hides. Each hide provides a place where you can sit down and observe wildlife at the Wetland Reserve. You will immediately see the Main Hide once you cross the Main Bridge.\nIn addition to the five hides, there are also two shelters along the Migratory Bird Trail.\nSungei Buloh\u2019s Aerie Tower\nThe only other major structure at the Sungei Buloh wetland is an 18-metre tall bird watching tower, the Aerie Tower. The tall structure has\u00a072 steps leading to the top and can be found opposite the Main Hide. However, you will have\u00a0to walk around the perimeter of the ponds\u00a0to get to it.\nNow, that you are oriented to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, here are five essentials that you need to bring along for your visit.\n1. A Sense of Adventure\n\u2018The world\u2019s big and I want to have a good look at it before it gets dark.\u201d \u2013 John Muir\nWith a bit of luck, you may be able to spot an estuarine crocodile, like this one, at Buloh Besar River.\nA healthy sense of adventure is essential. You never know exactly what you come across at Sungei Buloh and if you have an open mind, you will enjoy your visit even more. Every visit is different and you will be rewarded with a different experience each time.\n2. Patience\n\u201cAdopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.\u201d \u2013 Ralph Waldo Emerson\nMonitor Lizard at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve\nThe animals at Sungei Buloh are wild and you can\u2019t expect to them to appear on demand. If you wish to see the wildlife, you have to be patient. Sometimes, you will be able to see them and sometimes you won\u2019t. If it is not the migratory season, you shouldn\u2019t hope to see migratory birds \u2013 but there\u2019s still plenty of wildlife to spot. Don\u2019t power your way around the trail. A visit to Sungei Buloh is a chance to slow down and appreciate nature. Patience (with a bit of luck thrown in) pays off.\n3. A Keen Eye\n\u201cMany eyes go through the meadow, but few see the flower in it.\u201d \u2013 Ralph Waldo Emerson\nA snake well-camouflaged with a tree.\nFlora and fauna come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes, animals can be right under your nose and you may not notice them. Keep a lookout around you and above too. Pay attention to the rustling of leaves or the undergrowth. Try looking a bit closer and you may be surprised by what you come across.\n4. Softer Tones\n\u201cWhen one tunes in into nature\u2019s frequency, life becomes change, change becomes hope!\u201d Aniekee Tochukwu Ezekiel\nBird perched on a tree at Sungei Buloh\nNo, we are not talking about wearing the autumn collection to Sungei Buloh. We are talking about noise. Loud noise\u00a0scares away animals. It alerts them that you are coming and they tend to run\u00a0away. Trying walking and talking softer. Take a moment to remain\u00a0quiet in\u00a0the hides, wait for a while and see if anything comes out.\n5. Respect for Nature\n\u201cOur task must be to free ourselves\u2026 by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and it\u2019s beauty.\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein\nOtters spotted in the waters off Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve\nRemember to respect the wildlife you come across. Please don\u2019t poke or provoke them. Of course, you shouldn\u2019t destroy trees, break branches or bash carelessly through the undergrowth. It goes without saying that littering is a \u201cno-no\u201d. Practise the saying, \u201cTake nothing but pictures and leave behind nothing but footsteps\u201d.\nThere you have it, five essentials for your visit to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. You can also find out more information about the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Extension and Mudflats Experience .\nGetting to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve\nTo get to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve by bus, board SMRT Bus 925 from Kranji MRT Station. Alight at Kranji Reservoir Carpark B (to Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Extension\u2019s Visitor Centre).\nOn Sundays and Public Holidays, board SMRT Bus 925 from Kranji MRT Station and alight at the Wetland Centre entrance. SMRT Bus 925 operates only from Woodlands Interchange on Sundays and Public Holidays.\nAlternatively, take the Kranji Express bus from the Kranji MRT Station, starting from 8.30 am and ending at 5.45 pm daily.\nSungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is served by three parking lots.

The National Parks Board (NParks) estimates that the island has over 700 native species of plants, 215 species of birds, over 175 species of butterflies, over 50 species of dragonflies and damselflies, 40 species of reptiles and 30 species of mammals. Many of these species are very rare and some are not found on mainland Singapore.\nPulau Ubin is also a key sanctuary for wildlife such as the Greater Mousedeer, bats like the Ashy Roundleaf Bat and Lesser False Vampire, and birds like the Straw-headed Bulbul, Mangrove Pitta, Barred Eagle Owl and Brown Wood-owl. Pulau Ubin hosts the largest mangrove areas in Singapore and almost all mangrove plant species known to Singapore can be found here, including the rarest species in the world, the \u201cEye of the Crocodile\u201d.\nOne of Pulau Ubin\u2019s key attractions is Chek Jawa Wetlands, located on the eastern coast of the island. It has one of Singapore\u2019s richest ecosystems, where 6 major habitats meet and mix. Each habitat is home to an abundance of flora and fauna, such as rare plants as well as local and migratory birds. The marine biodiversity here is amazing, with about 500 species, according to NParks\u2019 records.\nNParks runs a visitor centre at Chek Jawa with a viewing jetty, over 1 km of boardwalk and a 21-metre tall viewing tower. Chek Jawa is also home to Singapore\u2019s only 2 mangrove Heritage Trees, which are listed in the Heritage Tree Register of Singapore. Known as Perepat or Mangrove Apple, they are possibly two of the biggest in Singapore.\nNParks and its volunteers carry out on-going field research and monitoring studies, including plant surveys, seagrass monitoring, bird ringing and camera trapping. Habitat enhancement efforts like reforestation, restoration of mangroves and rehabilitation of freshwater ponds, as well as species recovery projects like the Singapore Hornbill Project and Butterfly Hill, are also in place.\nChecklist of Fauna and Flora\nFauna\n\u00a9 2017 National Parks Board.

The hubbub of the center can be easily escaped into a lush countryside, where you can really appreciate the tranquility and find the connection to nature that resonates from these wondrous walking sites.\nAfter a long day of hiking, there's nothing more relaxing than a long soak to ease the aches and pains of tired muscles. What's best about Kyoto\u2019s top trail-ways is that you can do just that at one of the mineral-rich natural hot springs, or \u2018onsen\u2019 as they're known in Japanese, that are perfectly poised en route to unwind weary travelers. You can head for the hills in any season and won't need any specialist equipment, just remember to take your camera as the views offer some incredible photo opportunities!\nOhara - Visit Amazing Temples\nOhara, a rural farming village, only an hour by train and bus from central Kyoto, has to be high on the list for an afternoon of hiking and hot springs. Famed for growing shiso and making the most delicious tsukemono (Japanese pickles), Ohara also has a number of stunning temple complexes.\nLanterns lining the mountain path toward Kurama\nSanzen-in is the most acclaimed, particularly lovely in autumn when its grounds, a sea of maple trees whose leaves burn with a vermillion palette, are at their full glory. It\u2019s also the perfect starting point for the two and a half to three hour Ohara to Kurama hiking trail.\nMountain shrine in Kurama\nBegin in the morning with an hour or two wiling away in the grounds of Sanzen-in. From here head to Jakko-in, where you will enter the mountain trail passing in front of the Ebumi Shrine. Walk the Ebumi Ridge to the village of Shizuhara where you can slip into silent admiration for the stunning scenery.\nFrom Shizuhara the path leads over another ridge to the old village of Kurama, including outdoor hot springs where you can sit back and relax in the hot, healing waters. The trail can be reversed and onsen enjoyed in Ohara as well. There are both overnight and dayspring options available and the outdoor bath at Kurama Day Spa is a particular highlight.\nOhara\nAddress: Kyoto Prefecture, Kyoto City, Sakyo Ward, Ohara Raikouin-cho 81-2 (Kyoto Ohara Sightseeing Hoshokai) Google Map\nAccess: From Kokusaikaikan (Kyoto International Conference Center) Kyoto Municipal Subway Station, take Kyoto Bus 19 for 23 minutes\nOfficial Website: http://kyoto-ohara-kankouhosyoukai.net/ (Japanese)\nMout Hiei - A History-Rich Temple Mountain\nMountain steps on the Hieizan trail\nAbandoning the well-trodden, touristy temples of the inner city, hiking Mount Hiei presents visitors with not only spectacular natural scenery. It's famous cedars and scents have been chosen as one of the 'Kaori Fukei 100 Sen' or the 'Best 100 Scent Sceneries' in Japan. The Enryakuji temple complex, which radiates graceful elegance amongst an ocean of nature, is also one of its highlights.\nThere are a number of hiking routes to the summit and even a cable car for those who don't fancy the walk but the best path starts from Shugakuin Station, on the Eizan Line from Demachiyanagi. From here it\u2019s about a 15-minute walk, heading east past Shirakawa Dori and alongside the canal, to the trailhead. The first thirty minutes are steep and some parts of the path are carved between giant rocks with an uneven surface. Sturdy shoes are advised.\nEven though the path is steep, it\u2019s direct and very easy to follow, taking even inexperienced hikers no more than two hours to reach the top. The energy expenditure is worth it for the clean air thick with the smell of cedar and incense and the juxtaposition of bright vermillion structures nestled into lush greenery.\nDescending on the Shiga side of Hieizan brings you to Sakamoto and Ogoto Onsen where you can take a rest at one of the many onsen ryokans. For something particularly special, spend the night at Yomotokan Ryokan to unwind in their rooftop hot spring overlooking Lake Biwa.\nShugakuin Station\nAddress: Kyoto Prefecture, Kyoto City, Sakyo Ward, Yamabana ichoda-cho, 14-1 Google Map\nAccess: 30 to 40 minutes from JR Kyoto Station\nKameoka - Explore an Ancient Forest\nPrivate outdoor bath Sumiya Kihoan\nHeading west from Kyoto, past Arashiyama you will find a beautiful mountain area called Kameoka. Take the JR line train to Hozukyo station where you will be able to join the Akechigoe course of the Hozukyo Hiking Trail. After leaving the station, head north and follow the river towards the Old Mizuo Road. This will take you to your trailhead. Here turn east towards Doyo no Reisen and head east on the clearly signposted mountain path, which will take you to Kameoka via some stunning Shinto shrines sitting hidden in the ancient forest.\nThis area is famous for growing yuzu (a famous Japanese citrus fruit), with the Mizuo Yuzu Farm a short detour from the Old Mizuo Road. Here you can try the area\u2019s famous yuzu chicken sukiyaki or even bathe in yuzu-infused hot springs.\nPrivate outdoor bath Sumiya Kihoan\nThe highlight of the Kameoka hot-springs is Sumiya Kiho-an in the Yunohana Onsen region. They offer a day spa and lunch option or treat yourself to an overnight stay and join the likes of Yoko Ono and John Lennon who used to regularly frequent this ryokan when staying in Kyoto. At Sumiya the pools are radium-rich and believed to relieve neuralgia and arthritis, soothe chronic digestive diseases, fatigue and even alleviate gout. So just imagine what it will do for a few aching muscles.\nKameoka Akechigoe Hiking\nAddress: Kyoto Prefecture, Kameoka City, Hozu, Hozusan 3-1434 (JR Hozukyo Station) Google Map\nAccess: around 20 minutes from JR Kyoto Station\nEnjoy Exploring Kyoto's Surroundings!\nSpending time hiking the trails of Kyoto is an unmissable break from normal city exploration. Paths are strewn with beautiful temples meaning that you can still enjoy Kyoto\u2019s renowned culture whilst basking in the breathtaking natural beauty of the surrounding mountains. An afternoon of hiking and hot springs is the perfect way to explore and experience a different side to Kyoto!\nYou May Also Like\nContinue Reading\nThe information presented in this article is based on the time it was written.

            "Korea is filled with plenty of things like KBBQ, K-POP, cosmetics\u2026the list never ends, and that\u2019s precisely why many people find themselves returning to the country again and again.\nBut if you\u2019re looking to explore off the beaten path, the mountain ranges are a great way to see what Korea has to offer beyond its bustling cities. Below is a varied list with hikes of all difficulty levels \u2013 rated for those with average fitness levels and some hiking experience \u2013 with routes that will take as little as 1.5 hours, to those that stretch through 3D2N. Directions are included too!\nCheck out our other hiking articles:\nFor those looking for a quick and easily accessible hike, head to Bukhansan National Park. The mountain sits in the middle of Seoul, with the trailhead easily accessible by bus. As you near the top, you\u2019d be rewarded with a panoramic view of the cityscape, as well as the surrounding hills.\nView from the peak\nThe peak Bagunbong, sits at an elevation of 836.5 metres, and with a clear path and stairs lining parts of the route, this hike is pretty doable, albeit tiring.\nOn the way to the peak\nAlthough getting a pair of hiking shoes is recommended, there are plenty of people that head up in sports shoes. If you don\u2019t have a pair of good shoes, just bring some extra cash along to the trail head as there are a bunch of stores selling hiking equipment like footwear and hiking sticks there.\nPro-tip: Bukhansan is immensely crowded during the weekends, as it is widely popular among locals because of its proximity to the city centre and accessibility, so try to head there during weekdays instead.\nThe trail map is available here .\nHike difficulty: Moderate\nTime needed: ~ 5 hours\nGetting there: Take Line 3 to Gupabal Station (Exit 1) and take bus 704 to Bukhansanseong Fortress Entrance (\ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uc131) station.\n2. Suraksan, Seoul \u2013 quiet hike with view of seoul\u2019s outskirts\nNot to be confused with Seoraksan (#6), Suraksan is a lesser-known mountain in the outskirts of Seoul, perfect for those who want to avoid the crowd. At the peak, you\u2019ll be 638m high above sea level with a great view of the rolling hills around the mountain.\nThere are a bunch of routes you can take to explore the mountain, however one of the most popular ones begins at Danggogae Station (Exit 4) and ends at Suraksan Station.\nAttractions along the way include Hangnimsa temple, filled with colourful lanterns and chiming bells. The trail map is available here .\nPro-tip: I slipped and dropped my phone while hiking the icy paths of Suraksan in the winter \u2013 oops. If it\u2019s been snowing regularly prior to your hike, bring a pair of crampons (slip on spikes for your shoes) to avoid slipping and falling!\nHike difficulty: Moderate\nTime needed: ~ 3.5 hours\nGetting there: Take the Seoul Metro to Danggogae Station (Line 4). Take exit 4 and follow the Seoul Trail Sign and then \u201cTop of the Suraksan (Mt.)\u201d. Getting to the trail head is a bit hard as you\u2019d have to cut through residential areas. If you get lost, ask the friendly residents for directions!\n3. Yongmasan, Seoul \u2013 suitable for beginners\nFor those looking for a good beginner\u2019s hike, head to the 348 metre high Yongmasan. As a reference, this is approximately 2-3 times the height of Singapore\u2019s highest peak at Bukit Timah Hill.\nThere\u2019s a waterfall near the trailhead\nAlthough technically not a mountain, this hill has a great hike worth doing if you\u2019re visiting Seoul. On the way up, there are also lookout points with amazing views of the city to keep you pumped till you reach the end. The terrain starts easy, but gradually becomes steeper and more rugged as you reach the top.\nPro-tip: Many of the direction signs are in Korean. If you can\u2019t read their language, make sure you\u2019ve got a data sim card to do a quick Google translate!\nHike difficulty: Easy\nTime needed: ~ 3 hours\nGetting there: From Yongmasan Station (Line 7) Exit 2, walk 15 minutes towards Yongmasan Waterfall Park. The trail head is right next to the playground with a basketball court.\n4. Inwangsan, Seoul \u2013 hike along an old fortress wall\nAlthough it has the lowest elevations on the list, Inwangsan, with its highest peak at 338m, has a route packed with lots to see.\nThe trail takes you along the ancient fortress wall, and along the way, you\u2019ll be able to spot landmarks like Gyeongbokgung Palace, Namsan Park and even the Blue House, which is the\u00a0 president\u2019s house.\nFeel free to snap away on your camera, but avoid taking shots with the Blue House in it as there are patrolling officers that\u2019ll stop you for security reasons.\nThe route is easy with steps and a marked trail, but can get pretty exhausting near the top.\nHike difficulty: Easy\nTime needed: ~ 1.5 hours\nGetting there: From Dongnimmun Station (Line 3) Exit 2, and take bus 1020, 7212 or 7022 to Jahamun bus stop.\u00a0 Cross the road on your left and walk uphill all the way, then take the Inwangsan Jarak-gil trail until you reach a police post. The wooden stairs nearby is the trail head.\n\u2013 All around Korea \u2013\nIf go big or go home is your mantra, then head straight to Hallasan, the highest mountain in Korea, on the island of Jeju. Standing at 1950m, the majestic mountain is actually a dormant volcano which houses a beautiful crater lake at the top.\nWhile this mountain is physically tiring to climb, it\u2019s technically not difficult as the path is clear and well-developed with stairs covering a large portion of the trail. There are 2 trails heading up to the peak of Samgakbong:\nGwaneumsa \u2013 8.7KM one way\nSeongpanak \u2013 9.6KM one way.\nThe best way to hike Hallasan is a combination of these 2 routes \u2013 head up Seongpanak and down Gwaneumsa. The former is easier to hike up, with gentler elevation and the latter has the more magnificent views, which you\u2019ll be able to appreciate more on the way down.\nWhen you reach the peak, make sure to get a photo of yourself there as proof, as you can get a certificate of achievement (1,000KRW ~ S$1) when you get back down to the base! The trail map is available here .\nHike difficulty: Medium\nTime needed: ~ 8 hours\nGetting there: From Jeju Bus terminal, take bus 281 and alight at Seongpanak trailhead. From Segwipo, take bus 182 and alight at Seongpanak trailhead.\n6. Seoraksan, Gangwon-do \u2013 deemed the most beautiful mountain in Korea\nProclaimed by Koreans to be the most beautiful mountain in South Korea, Seoraksan in Gangwon-do will probably give you the most scenic experience among everything in this list.\nThere are many trails that branch out from the visitor centre, that bring you to various attractions around the park. But for the adrenaline junkies out there, head to the peak of Daecheongbong which sits 1,708 meters high.\nDepending on which route you choose, you\u2019d get to encounter sights such as caves, valleys and clear streams. The hike will take around 13 hours so make sure you start really early. For those who wish to cover the route in 2 days instead, you can pre-book a slot in one of the shelters to make camp.\nSeorak Cable Car (KRW9,000 ~S$10.40)\nOther attractions here include Ulsanbawi Rock, Sinheungsa Temple and Seorak Cable Car \u2013 which takes you to the peak, Gwongeumseong Fortress, which is the former site of a castle.\nHike difficulty: Hard \u2013 especially near the peak\nDistance: 18.3KM\nTime needed: ~ 13 hours\nGetting there: From Seoul, head to the Dong-Seoul Bus terminal and take an intercity bus to Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal, then take bus 7 or 7-1 to Seoraksan National Park.\n7. Jirisan, Gyeongsangnam-do \u2013 for those seeking a challenge\nFor those looking to completely immerse themselves in the wild, head to Jirisan in\u00a0 Gyeongsangnam-do. It is the largest national park in the whole of South Korea, and stretches across 3 provinces and 5 cities.\nIf you\u2019re up for a challenge, pack your camping gear and head for the Main Ridge Course that stretches across 32.5KM and requires at least 3 days and 2 nights. It\u2019s the most popular course among hikers, and takes you across multiple ridges, and through the peak of the mountain range of Cheonwangbong (1,915m).\nIf camping isn\u2019t your cup of tea, or perhaps reminds you too much of BMT, there are also plenty of day hikes you can explore.\nPro-tip: Hiking communities are very popular in Korea. If you are worried about heading on a long hike without a guide, consider looking out for scheduled trip in groups like Climbing in Korea , Indigo Hill , and Must Go Korea .\nHike difficulty: Very Hard(Main Ridge Hike)\nDistance: 32.5KM\n8. Naejangsan, Jeollabuk-do \u2013 best Autumn foliage\nIf you\u2019re headed to South Korea in the autumn, make sure to visit Naejangsan for its beautiful autumn foliage. The entire mountain bursts into hues of red and orange around September to October.\nOne of the most popular routes here is the 8-peak hike along the ridges of the mountains, which passes by all the peaks, including the highest one of Sinseongbong (763 metres).\nUhwajeong Pavilion\nOther scenic things to do and see in the area include the Baekyangsa Walking Trail Course (8.5km, one-way), as well as visiting the Naejang Temple and Uhwajeong Pavilion.\nThe trail map is available here .\nHike difficulty: Medium\nDistance: 11KM, loop trail\nTime needed: ~7 hours\nGetting there: From Jeongeup Station, take bus 171 to the bus terminal at the last stop (30min). To get to\u00a0 Jeongeup from Seoul, take the KTX 39,500KRW (~S$45) /pax, which will take approximately 1.5 hours.\n9. Wolchulsan, Yeongnam Gul \u2013 suspended cloud bridge\nLocated in the Southern part of South Korea, Wolchulsan is a relatively unknown mountain rarely visited by foreigners, perfect for those who are looking for something off the beaten path.\nThe mountain\u2019s main draw for many hikers is its Gureumdari Bridge, or cloud bridge \u2013 a vibrant red suspended structure standing out from the terrain\u2019s rocky surface.\nFor those who want to cover the highest peak Cheonhwangbong at 809 metres, as well as Gureumdari Bridge, head for the Mountain Ridge Trail. It stretches 9.4KM and takes you through these main attractions as well as Gujeongbong Peak, Eoksaebat (Pampas Grass Field) and Dogapsa Temple.\nImage credit: @roamingaroundtheworld\nHike difficulty: Medium\nMountains to hike in South Korea\nWhen it comes to mountains, the first thing that comes to mind might be the Alps, Andes or perhaps the Himalayas. But if you\u2019re looking for somewhere nearby for your hiking fix, look no further than South Korea, which is filled with so many mountains, you could say the task of climbing them all is insurmountable. *wink* Korean hikers are also super friendly and often share snacks like oranges and kimbap (rice seaweed rolls) with strangers while hiking. If you\u2019d like to make some new friends, bring some extra snacks to share! Looking for more things to do in Korea?

The skyline and its buildings. Here's what you should be taking a closer look at\nRaffles Place\nBefore Jewel Changi Airport came into the picture, the airport tower is the most recognisable landmark of Changi Airport \u2013 and still remains iconic according to many Singaporeans. It's the first thing you see when approaching the airport and the last view you have of the place as your taxi pulls away.\u00a0Officially opened in 1981, the iconic tower stands at about 81 metres above sea level\u00a0and handles as many as about 1,000 aircraft movements a day.\nNew buildings go up each year but still,\u00a0the city\u2019s world-famous half-lion, half-fish mascot remains an iconic landmark \u2013 and symbol \u2013 to Singapore's heritage. More than 8m tall and spouting water into the bay around the clock, this central figure of many postcards and souvenirs was fashioned by a local craftsman, but relocated in 2002 to its current \u2013 and more scenic \u2013 location. A 70-tonne sculpture that draws tourists all day long, the statue at Merlion Park is one of seven commissioned Merlions around Singapore, which include other statues of different sizes in Mount Faber and Sentosa.\nThe former three-storey\u00a0creative\u00a0space that\u00a0was home to artists and creative types may be demolished but in its place is a cooler, more interesting building. In a sea of grey buildings in an industrial area, The Mill stands out with its Art Deco style, complete with a gothic tower. And if the design looks a little familiar, that's because one of the towers of The Mill was designed by the same team who worked on the iconic Parkview Square in Bugis. The other tower \u2013 also in gothic style \u2013 is designed by an established architecture firm in Singapore who have designed landmarks like St Andrew's Cathedral and Goodwood Park Hotel. On the inside, The Mill remains to be a creative hub, counting a bespoke tailor and a couple of interior design firms as tenants.\nChangi\nOn the outside, it might just look like a futuristic dome but step inside and you'll see that this majestic dome is home to over 280 dining and retail outlets, the tallest indoor waterfall in the world and even a man-made rainforest. Designed by world-renowned architect Moshe Safdie (who also did Marina Bay Sands), Jewel features a distinctive dome-shaped facade made of glass and steel, making it an iconic landmark in the airport\u2019s landscape.\nCity Hall\nAfter three years of redevelopment, the mall formerly known as Funan DigitaLife Mall is starting a new chapter. It is now home to a variety of more than 190 brands clustered around the themes of tech, craft, play, fit, chic and taste. Keeping it modern, industrial chic is the aesthetic of the mall with many vibrant corners and spaces within the mall like the Tree of Life, the Kinetic Wall, a seven-storey green wall and even an urban farm operated by Edible Garden City on the rooftop.\nRaffles Place\nHousing Thai eateries, karaoke lounges, occult shops, mini grocery stores and also residential apartments, Golden Mile Complex also has quite a history. Designed in the Brutalist style that was popular back then, the 16-storey building was hailed an architectural and cultural marvel once. Over the years, and a lot of paint coats later,\u00a0its future is still uncertain. Still, take the chance to check out this monolith, and then get a plate of pad thai after.\nChinatown\nLocated beside Chinatown MRT Station, PARKROYAL on Pickering\u00a0stands out in the CBD skyline of concrete and glass with its layers of greenery. Designed to be built like an office and hotel in a garden, look a little closer and you'll see that the interesting facade is made up of skygardens, reflective pools, and plant walls. Pretty impressive for a high-rise.\nArt\nCity Hall\nThe former City Hall and Supreme Court buildings have been refurbished to become the National Gallery. Now in the heart of the civic district, both buildings have been central to several of Singapore's historial milestones. First constructed in the 1920s, it is now the largest visual art gallery in Singapore, and mostly dedicated to local and South-East Asian art from the 19th century to today. Take in the collection of artwork and the historially rich halls and all its grandeur.\nRochor\nWidely and fondly known as 'the Gotham building' by locals, Parkview Square is an Art Deco monolith in a sea of buildings.\u00a0Designed by Singapore\u2019s DP Architects and James Adams Design of USA, the majestic exterior\u00a0screams luxury with\u00a0bronze, granite and glass.\u00a0Take a walk in the courtyard before entering the building and you'll find yourself acquainted with bronze effigies of Salvador Dal\u00ed, Mozart, Isaac Newton, Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, Shakespeare, Plato, Dante, Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein. The ostentatiousness doesn't end there. Inside, the grandeur of\u00a0Atlas Bar\u00a0will be the first thing you notice. The bar is dedicated to gin, and stocks hundreds of rare or limited edition varieties within a three-storey-tall tower that dominates the space.\nJurong West\nIf you feel hungry staring at this building, we'd totally understand. The Hive at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), also known as the Learning Hub looks strikingly like a dim sum basket. The $45 million eight-storey building was designed by renowned British designer Thomas Heatherwick and a hub for the university's newly adopted \"flipped classroom\" teaching method - in which students watch lectures online and class time is used to delve deeper into the topic through discussions and debates. Ah, to be a student at NTU.\nCity Hall\nOnce a convent school, CHIJMES has transformed into a hip lifestyle enclave brimming with bars, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. It\u2019s currently undergoing a revamp \u2013 and it\u2019s more than just a cosmetic update. A fleet of new F&B joints are flocking to the old school, including El Mero Mero, Here & There, and Prive.\nCity Hall\nThe iconic red and white Central Fire Station, completed in 1908 has a watchtower and living quarters for firemen. Best thing? The building is still in use as a fire station. If you're hoping to tour the place, remember to have a\u00a0kid along with you. On Saturday mornings kids get to ride on an engine and take pictures with the Red Rhinos (a smaller version of the fire truck) and the firemen. The Civil Defence Heritage Gallery next door (open Tue-Sun, 10am-5pm), is also a mini fire-fighting museum housing old trucks and equipment, plus interactive games and activities on the second level.\nLove it or hate it, The Interlace is a mind-boggling, if not fascinating sight in the Alexandra neighbourhood. Resembling Jenga blocks, the condominium features 31 six-storey blocks irregularly stacked on each other. The spaces between each block are then used for the condo amenities like lush roof gardens, swimming pools, tennis courts and courtyards.\nHeritage shophouses\nPerhaps the most charming form of iconic architecture on the list are the heritage shophouses in Singapore. Beautifully restored, you'll still find them around the island. From the residential shophouse homes at Katong and Joo Chiat to the ones that line Amoy and Telok Ayer Street, shophouses are a glimpse of how buildings were made in the past. With Peranakan tiles, French windows and Malay timber fretwork, our heritage shophouses are an eclectic mix of Chinese, Malay and European influences.\nAdvertising\nMarina Bay\nFrom Supertrees to a\u00a0tropical highland\u00a0in a glass dome, Gardens by the Bay is an architecture wonder in itself (sans Marina Bay Sands). The park sprawling across 101 hectares of land deserves recognition on its own for how it is meticulously planned, from its man-made lake to the massive Meadows by the Bay where some festivals have been held. There's also the indoor\u00a0Flower Dome and Cloud Forest \u2013 both futuristic and lush greenhouses perfect for a stroll.\nHabourfront\nDesigned by Daniel Libeskind who also created the masterplan of the World Trade Center Memorial, Reflections @ Keppel Bay is a futuristic glass masterpiece sitting pretty in by the bay. The luxury waterfront residential complex also has the best panoramic views of Mount Faber and Sentosa.\nOur HDB flats\nWhile it might not be as swanky as some of the buildings on the list, our own HDB flats are a testament to the ever-changing\u00a0landscape of Singapore. From the simple pastel-coloured vintage blocks to modern HDB\u00a0developments like\u00a0the Pinnacle@Duxton and SkyTerrace@Dawson,\u00a0our HDB blocks are definitely architectural icons.\nAdvertising\nChinatown\nA trip to Chinatown is not complete without a visit to People's Park Complex. Hailed as a masterpiece of 1970s experimental architecture, the mustard yellow building we know now took cues from the Brutalist architectural style popular at that time \u2013 and was actually finished in raw concrete before it went through several colourful rebirths. The bustling building is now a mixed-use building where you can find street snacks, jewellery stores, electronic goods and other knick knacks. The rooftop carpark is also the perfect place for that impromptu photo shoot.\nRaffles Place\nBesides blowout brunch buffets and being a stately five-star hotel, The Fullerton Hotel Singapore isn't always known as building of luxury. Built as a fort in 1829, the building later also became home to the country\u2019s General Post Office in 1928. While the neo-classical fa\u00e7ade remains, the heritage building holds 400 hotel rooms,\u00a0a spa, infinity pool and 24-hour fitness centre.\nEven on an intense hike, you can also appreciate great architecture. The wave-shaped 36-metre pedestrian bridge connecting Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park is the best place for you to take a breather from the walking and climbing and take in the views from the bridge.\nCity Hall\nFew buildings have created such a stir as this one. Opened in 2002, the eye-catching bayfront complex has been dubbed \u2018the durians\u2019 by locals because of its resemblance to the spiky tropical fruit. Built at a cost of $600 million, the Esplanade is Singapore\u2019s premier performing arts centre and often draws comparisons with the Sydney Opera House. Its crown jewels are the 1,600-seat Concert Hall and the 2,000-seat Theatre. There is also a black box Theatre Studio (seating 220) and a Recital Studio (245).\nMarina Bay\nWith more than 2,500 rooms and suites, Marina Bay Sands claims to be the biggest hotel in Singapore. We believe them. The rooms offer views of the South China Sea or Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline, but let\u2019s be honest: the Moshe Safdie-designed SkyPark is the real crowd puller. Sitting prettily atop the three hotel towers 200 metres high, hotel guests and outsiders (who part with $20 for the privilege) can enjoy unfettered views from the Observation Deck. The best views are to be had from the infinity pool, the largest of its kind. Swimming is for hotel guests only but outsiders can watch smug guests swim while munching on $6 hot dogs, which is almost as fun. Sort of.\nThings to do\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu! We already have this email.

            "Landmarks in Thailand \u2013 21 iconic places you just can\u2019t miss\nIt\u2019s known as the Land of Smiles for it\u2019s friendly, beaming people. But Thailand is also a country known for its phenomenal natural beauty, alongside thousands of breath-taking temples, bustling city streets and even it\u2019s sports like muay thai. But, if you had to make a list, what are the top-rated attractions in the country; the best landmarks in Thailand?\nIt feels almost impossible to make a list that represents Thailand, it\u2019s just jam-packed with so much to see. So we enlisted a bit of help from some of the globe\u2019s foremost travel bloggers, who each told us about their favourite attraction. Read on for the Top 10 Landmarks in Thailand, alongside a \u2018bonus\u2019 list as long as your arm.\nFun fact: The term \u2018Siamese twins\u2019 originated in Thailand! When the country was still known as Siam, two brothers \u2013 Chang and Eng Bunker \u2013 were born joined at the chest. Nowadays we all prefer the term \u2018conjoined twins\u2019, in case you\u2019re looking to be politically correct.\nSkip ahead\nTop 10 landmarks in Thailand\nDon\u2019t feel like reading ahead? Here\u2019s a handy list of the most famous landmarks in Thailand.\nWat Rong Khun (The White Temple)\nJames Bond Island\nKhao San Road\nRailay Beach\nAng Thong Marine Park\nWat Rong Khun, better known as The White Temple, is located in the north of Thailand and considered one of the best things to do in Chiang Rai .\nLittle information exists about the original Wat Rong Khun, but we know that it fell into disrepair and was rebuilt by Chalermchai Kositpipat, a famous Thai artist from Chiang Rai. The current temple is a little over 20 years old and as its name suggests, it\u2019s unique in that everything is white, representing the purity of Buddha.\nThe building is covered in symbols depicting religious stories and messages. It has been designed to take you on a journey, starting in hell where creepy hands reach out from the ground symbolising human desires such as greed and lust. As you successfully navigate past the clutches of human desire, you\u2019ll pass over a bridge to heaven where you\u2019re able to pray.\nThe artist clearly didn\u2019t take himself too seriously, look out for the pop culture references hidden in the artwork throughout the temple, including Spider Man, Angry Birds, Michael Jackson and Ronald McDonald.\nHead out from Chiang Mai on this fantastic tour , to see the temple (and more!)\nJames Bond Island\nStriking scenery including towering vertical limestone karsts and emerald green water, James Bond Island is one of the most popular islands in Phuket. The real name of this island is Koh Tapu and it became famous for its appearance in the 1974 James Bond film \u2018The Man with the Golden gun\u2019.\nPart of Phang Nga Bay and the 100 plus islands in this area, it\u2019s just 40km away from Phuket and often visited as a full or half day tour from Phuket itself.\nInsider Tip: James Bond Island, like all the popular beaches of Phuket, can get extremely crowded. Try to get there early in the morning to avoid the crowd. You could also add Hong and Khai islands to your trip.\nYou can book a day trip with one of the most trusted companies, Get your Guide, here.\nKhao San Road, Bangkok\nLike moths to a flame, all travellers tend to find themselves drawn to the bright lights of the Khao San Road at some point. Indeed, so many big adventures have begun and ended on this infamous strip and it is an absolute must do for anyone venturing to Thailand. This bustling street makes for some fascinating people-watching and certainly packs a lot into a few hundred metres: colourful hippy stalls, lively bars, food-vendors serving fried scorpion, cheap backpacker hostels.\nAnd if you\u2019re visiting Thailand with kids , you\u2019ll find Th Khao San incredibly family friendly; many restaurants have high chairs and all are welcome to young kids. However, step a few streets away from the chaos and you will stumble upon the quintessential side of Bangkok, a collection of ramshackle laneways, shining temples and antique shophouses.\nYou could while many an hour away along Th Khao San. Indeed many arrive in the early afternoon to browse the markets (it\u2019s a great place to stock up on T-shirts, sarongs and skirts, as well as souvenirs) and then find themselves still perched on plastic chair, tucking into their third pad thai of the day come closing time. It\u2019s often considered touristy, but the energy is infectious. So embrace the craze of it all and visit this manic landmark of Thailand.\nAncient City of Ayutthaya\nVisit the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ayutthaya for its rich history and its peaceful temples. Think of it as a smaller-scale version of Angkor in Cambodia, minus the crowds.\nFounded in 1350, Ayutthaya flourished as the second capital of the Siamese kingdom after Sukhothai, before being razed to the ground by the Burmese in 1767. Although these fires ravaged Ayutthaya\u2019s wooden palaces, they spared its brick and stone temples.\nBuilt in the graceful Sri Lankan and Khmer architectural styles, these temples are magnificent. For example, the achingly beautiful Wat Phra Mahathat features dozens of red brick spires, leaning at precarious angles, and a serene Buddha head cradled in the roots of a Bodhi tree.\nInsider tips: To enjoy the serenity of the sites in the absence of day trippers and the laid-back vibe of the modern city, try to stay overnight. You should also take a late-afternoon boat trip to visit Ayutthaya\u2019s riverside temples and to watch the sun set behind Wat Chai Watthanaram\nTake a day trip from Bangkok to see this ancient city, and the floating market. Book it here .\nPhi Phi Islands\nThe Phi Phi Islands are one of those iconic must-see places in Thailand . Located in the Andaman Sea, the Phi Phi islands are a 2-hour ferry away from the popular tourist destination of Phuket.\nThe Phi Phi Islands have become a famous tourist destination because of Maya Bay in Koh Phi Phi Lei, the secret lagoon that featured in Leonardo di Caprio\u2019s movie The Beach. Today Maya Bay is closed due to over tourism, with no set plans to open up again, but you can still visit other parts of the Phi Phi Lei and the other Phi Phi Islands, which are just as stunning.\nKoh Phi Phi Don, the main island and the only one with a town on it, has some incredible views and beaches. On top of that, the island is entirely pedestrian (no scooters or cars anywhere!) and has a chill and fun vibe. There is a party area in the town if you\u2019re into that, but even if you\u2019re not you can walk around the town in evenings and enjoy some chill bars and restaurants.\nFrom Koh Phi Phi Don you can go on boat trips to the surrounding Phi Phi islands, doing all sorts of fun activities like snorkelling, scuba diving, swimming with luminescent plankton after sundown and just relaxing on board. Even if Maya Bay is closed, the Phi Ph islands are beautiful and worthy of a visit anyway.\nBook a cruising trip to the Phi Phi Islands with Get your Guide, here.\nWat Arun (Temple of the Dawn), Bangkok\nExplored by Melissa from Thrifty Family Travels\nWat Arun (also called the Temple of Dawn), is a stunning Buddhist temple and is one of the most beautiful and most visited attractions in Bangkok .\u00a0 The temple was built in the 17th century and is made up of numerous pagodas all decorated with millions of pieces of coloured tiles. The central pagoda is 82 metres high and is surrounded by four smaller pagodas.\nGiven this is a popular site in Bangkok, expect lots of tourists in the middle of the day.\u00a0 If at all possible go first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon.\u00a0 In fact its\u2019s meant to be just stunning at dawn or sunset.\nYou will need to have your knees and shoulders covered to enter the temple, but if you do forget you can hire or purchase sarongs at the entrance.\nEntry to the temple is 50 baht (1.70 USD / 1.30 GBP) per person and it is open daily between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm.\nFun fact: Walk around the towers in a clockwise fashion, as doing it anti-clockwise is considered bad luck.\nRailay Beach\nExplored by Loredana from Destguides\nOne of the most famous beaches in the world, Railay Beach is easily accessible by a longtail boat from either Krabi Town or Ao Nang, which it lies in between. You can also catch a short flight from places like Bangkok to Krabi International Airport if you\u2019re not in the area yet.\nRailay Beach is worth a visit and a must for your bucket list as its turquoise water is set against a backdrop of limestone rock formations. Not only that but once you dock at Railay Beach, you can walk over to the other side of the peninsula for a more chilled out vibe, rock climbing and more swimming areas, such as the beach located at the Princess Cave.\nInsider Tips: If you\u2019re only doing a day trip, head back earlier in the evening as the longer you wait, the more expensive the boat tickets for the way back get. Consider also visiting this part of Thailand sometime after October as beforehand is the rainy season, and the waters are more cloudy and greener in colour.\nWat Pho (and the Grand Palace), Bangkok\nWat Pho is one of the most visited temples in all of Thailand, and for a good reason. It\u2019s one of the biggest Bangkok landmarks and features some of the most impressive structures as well as the massive reclining Buddha.\nIt\u2019s a large complex that can easily be combined with the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha), which are located within walking distance from Wat Pho. Furthermore, the temple complex is still a place where you can see genuine Buddhist monks in the early mornings, and it\u2019s also considered to be one of the leading schools for Thai massage.\nThere are hundreds of impressive statues and you could literally walk around this place for hours. It\u2019s recommended to visit with a local guide who can explain the history and more about each chapel. It\u2019s open daily from early morning until 6:30 pm.\nAng Thong Marine Park\nThe Ang Thong Marine Park is an archipelago of 42 pristine islands close to Ko Samui in Thailand. The area is perfect for kayaking, snorkelling and just lazing on the idyllic beaches as the emerald waters lap at your feet.\nIf you are feeling fit, you can take a hike up to the 500 metre viewing platform on Ko Wau Ta Lap for expansive views out across the islands. If you prefer to stay at sea-level then take a short hike to the Bua Boke Cave with its impressive array of stalactites and stalagmites.\nThere is a real life \u201cblue lagoon\u201d on next-door Koh Mae Koh and more pristine beaches which avoid the hordes of day trippers.\nInsider Tip: To really get the most out of a visit to Ang Thong, consider staying overnight at the campsite or hire a wooden shack where you can get back to basics and enjoy a piece of tranquillity once the day-trippers leave.\nThe Similan Islands\nThe\u00a0Similan\u00a0Islands, an archipelago located just off the west coast of Phuket, offer some of the best scuba diving sites in the world. Enjoy a few days on a liveaboard taking in all the best dive sites, including Koh Bon and Richelieu Rock.\nWake up early for the sunrise, and hit the water for your first dive before breakfast, with a total of 3-4 dives a day, sometimes including a night dive where you\u2019ll be able to enjoy the otherworldly luminescent underwater creatures. The\u00a0Similan\u00a0Islands offer some of the best pelagic diving in the world, and if you\u2019re lucky you\u2019ll spot some oceanic manta rays and maybe even a majestic whale or shark or two.\nRatchada Rod Fai Train Night Market, Bangkok\nExplored by Emily from Wander-Lush\nThailand is synonymous with market culture \u2013 no trip to the country would be complete without visiting at least a few night food markets. The much-photographed Ratchada Rod Fai Train Night Market in Bangkok is one of the most impressive (and Instagrammable) markets in the whole country.\nRod Fai earned its moniker from its original location near the train tracks behind Chatuchak, another popular market. When it moved closer to the city in 2013, the name stuck. The Rachada market is actually Rod Fai\u2019s second branch. It\u2019s central location right next to the Thailand Cultural Center MRT makes it convenient to reach by public transport.\nPreviously just a weekend affair, it\u2019s now open every night from 5pm. Down on ground level, Rod Fai is a well-organised conglomeration of street food stalls, clothing and homewares vendors set in neat rows. The theme of Rod Fai is \u2018retro\u2019 \u2013 lots of stallholders specialise in memorabilia, antiques, and vintage-style clothing. At the front of the market there\u2019s a row of trendy bars, some set in shipping containers. Food wise, BBQ seafood (especially shrimp) is the specialty here. Mango sticky rice and sweet crepes are also ubiquitous.\nInsider Tip: When you arrive, make a beeline for the nearby Esplanade building. The car park on level four is where you can get that iconic bird\u2019s eye view of the colourful market tents.\nWat Tham Pha Plong, Chiang Dao\nExplored by Heather from Conversant Traveller\nThis cave temple is special because it\u2019s a bit off the beaten tourist track, and you won\u2019t find it splashed all over Instagram, despite being in a beautiful position with stunning mountain views all around.\nPerched on the side of the famous Doi Luang Chiang Dao mountain, Wat Tham Pha Plong is a highlight of any visit to the region. As with many temples in Thailand, there are a lot of steps up the hillside to negotiate (500 in fact), but the monks who live here have helpfully put motivational signs with Buddhist sayings along the way, including one telling hikers \u201cdo not grumble when you suffer, just persevere\u201d.\nVisiting the temple is one of the most serene experiences you can have in Thailand, and with few other visitors it feels truly authentic. After the climb you can sit and meditate in the cool cave, or admire the golden stupa glowing in the sun and chat to any monks who may be present.\nSanctuary of Truth, Pattaya\nThe captivating Sanctuary of Truth in Pattaya is one of the most unique tourist attractions in Thailand. A modern-day architectural wonder, the Sanctuary was commissioned by a wealthy Thai businessman in 1981. The ornate building symbolises a commonality between religions through a shared belief in a higher truth.\nSet on a peaceful headland to the north of Wongamat Beach on the edge of the ocean, this colossal, wooden structure right on the water\u2019s edge is magnificent. For over 30 years, wood cravers have been carving this intricate and captivating shrine right on the edge of Pattaya\u2019s urban sprawl. The complex is due to be completed in 2050. Wander through the workshops and watch the carvers busy at work.\nThe city of Pattaya isn\u2019t renowned for its cultural assets and as you enter The Sanctuary of Truth, you may be forgiven for thinking that you\u2019re arriving at yet another awful tacky tourist attraction.\nHowever, once you have passed the paintballing, horse-riding and elephant ride touts, you can\u2019t help but be impressed by this amazing building and the life-size wooden statues and scenes within it. A visit to The Sanctuary of Truth is without a doubt, also one of the most family-friendly things to see in Pattaya .\nPhanomrung Temple, Buriram\nIt is common to find the occasion Khmer influences in Thailand, brought by the ancient Khmer Kingdom better known from next door in neighbouring Cambodia. And these tend to follow what is known as the Ancient Khmer Highway, a 225-kilometre road which leads from the famed Angkor Temples of Cambodia and through the Thai borders of North Eastern Thailand aka Isaan.\nBut the most magnificent of these sites on this side of Thailand would be Phanomrung Temple and the surrounding historical park, located near the smaller town of Nang Rong in Buriram. And it is a somewhat off-the-beaten-track location making it a more serene experience away from the usual tourist paths elsewhere in Thailand.\nSo the temple itself is located on an extinct volcano overlooking the Thai-Cambodian borders, and it is in reverence of the Hindu God Shiva as many of these Khmer ruins are in the region. And the site is really well preserved with stone pillar carvings and a stairway of serpent heads (Naga) leading up to the upper sanctuary fifteen doorways of the temple.\nFun fact: Each year there is a huge ceremony, known as the Phanomrung Temple Festival, to celebrate the morning bi-annual sunrise when the sun aligns perfectly with the doorways of the temple.\nKong Lan (Pai Canyon), Pai\nExplored by Lauren and Darren from Faramagan\nPai Canyon is known locally as Kong Lan and is one of the most popular things to do in Pai but also one of the most striking sunset spots in the country. It is located 5 miles south of Pai on the infamously windy road known as Route 1095 which stretches from Chiang Mai and has over 762 hairpin corners.\nAdmission to Pai Canyon is free and there is ample space to park. Once parked, there is a short hike up paved steps which then open up to an impressive canyon complete with narrow edges and high sandstone cliffs. It is recommended to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to sunset in order to secure a good spot before the crowds and bus tours arrive.\nIf you have plans to explore more of the canyon and embrace the narrow trails, please do not attempt it in flip flops! The sandstone edges are covered in dust which makes the trails incredibly slippery with sheer drops at parts. Thankfully, you do not need to venture far along the canyon to admire the views. There is no need to risk climbing to a quieter, more photo worthy space as these trails are notoriously dangerous \u2013 stick to the start of the canyon. Also, beware when stepping back for a photo as it\u2019s easy to lose footing on the high cliffs or get lost in the beautiful views to realise how high the canyon is.\nInsider Tip: If want to avoid the crowds completely, head to the canyon for sunrise \u2013 not only will you beat the heat, but you can admire the views without the bus tours and backpackers who\u2019d rather have a lie in!\nSunrise Beach, Koh Lipe\nSunrise Beach is one of the beaches you can find on the quiet island of Koh Lipe , about 60 km south of mainland Thailand. It\u2019s not the only one \u2014 there is also Pattaya Beach and Sunset Beach, but arguably it is the most beautiful. It has fine white sand and clear blue water where you can enjoy an afternoon of swimming and beach bumming. You can just lay down on a towel and read a book or enjoy a refreshing fruit shake.\nSunrise Beach is relatively quiet compared to the Pattaya Beach which is used as a port. That saying, you can still find establishments here including beach resorts, bars and restaurants, spas, and more. If you want to wake up with an ocean view, you definitely want to book in a resort along Sunrise Beach.\nKoh Lipe is one of the remaining off-beaten destinations in Thailand. Still, it\u2019s best to book your stay here in advance especially during peak season and holidays.\nPhu Chi Fa\nPhu Chi Fa is the best place in Thailand that you\u2019ve probably never heard of! It is a located in the extreme north-east of the country in Chiang Rai province, and is a two hour journey by road (90km) from the city of Chiang Rai.\nSo why would you want to visit?\nPhu Chi Fa is famed for having the best sunrises in Thailand. After a short, but steep trek, the views from the top are simply astonishing. Looking out over the Mekong basin, the valley is often filled with a thick layer of cloud, through which the peaks of the mountain range poke through. When the sun rises it turns the cloud a series of spectacular colours before finally burning off the haze and welcoming the day. On our visit we weren\u2019t lucky enough to witness the low lying clouds, but the views down into Laos were amazing, and if you are a country \u2018collector\u2019 you can actually step across the border into Laos at the top.\nWat Doi Suthep (Golden Temple), Chiang Mai\nAbout 40 minutes out of Chiang Mai is the gorgeous Golden Temple, Wat Doi Suthep; one of the most famous buildings in Thailand. About 300 steps lead you up to the mountain temple, characterized by heavy gold accents and a number of other sights surrounding it.\nThis beautiful shrine was commissioned by King Kuena, ruler of Chiang Mai from 1367-88. According to an old legend, the king was persuaded to build the temple when the monk Sumana presented him with a bone relic of the historical Buddha.\nWhile you are there, you can do the monk chat at their Buddhism Centre, or visit the large hilltop Hmong village; its one of the best things to do in Thailand. There are even a few waterfalls nearby, to cool off if you like.\nThe Hellfire Pass (and Bridge over the River Kwai)\nHellfire Pass or Konyu Cutting to the Japanese in Kanchanaburi Thailand is a section of the Thai-Burma railway that was hand made by forced labor from Allied prisoners of war in World War II. It is otherwise known as the Death Railway.\nJust outside of Kanchanaburi the Australian Government in conjunction with the Thai government have set a museum and information center where people can go to learn the history that happened in this part of Thailand. It incorporates the impact the Railway also had on the local people who lived in the area. Hellfire Pass gets its name from the men who saw it \u2013 they described looking down at their fellow prisoners of war working by fire light in the night as a scene from Hell itself.\nYou can visit the museum before taking the path down to the cutting in the rock. It is hard to imagine what it would have been like for the men working to complete it. The heat, the insects that never seem to go away, the rain when it was the monsoon season and the abundant loss of life all around you is something we will never comprehend.\nInteresting Fact: The Death Railway is also famous for having a bridge over the river Kwai, which shares a name with the famous film.\nBonus: More landmarks in Thailand\nThere are just so many special places in the country that didn\u2019t make this list.

            "Six of Thailand\u2019s Most Magnificent Temples\nIt should come as no surprise that Thailand is a country of temples, given the significant role that Buddhism plays in its culture\nWat Phra Dhammakaya (istock/Intek1)\nAugust 2, 2019\nPeering out into the rolling hills that make up much of Thailand\u2019s landscape, it\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s a country of temples. From the majestic temples poking out from behind stands of trees in rural areas to those found along the congested city streets of Bangkok, visitors don\u2019t have to travel far to find one.\nAccording to the Office of National Buddhism , there are more than 33,000 temples used by monks scattered across the country, which should come as no surprise considering that 95 percent of the population practices Buddhism , a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of Buddha. And you needn't be a practicing Buddhist to appreciate the architectural significance of each iconic temple, from Wat Rong Khun, known as the White Temple thanks to its all-white fa\u00e7ade, to the dozens of other lesser-known but equally impressive temples where visitors can find solitude and peacefulness.\nHere are six iconic temples worth the trek.\nWat Rong Khun\nWat Rong Khun (istock/Rmnunes)\nIn the midafternoon sun, Wat Rong Khun, also known as the White Temple, can appear downright blinding. Thai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat looked to Buddha for inspiration when creating this intricately designed temple, selecting a whitewashed facade tinged with mirrors that perfectly reflect the sunlight. Kositpipat chose the all-white color palette to represent \u201crighteousness and the encouragement of good karma,\u201d according to Tourism Thailand . Other symbolic touches include a bridge crossing called the \u201cbridge of the cycle of rebirth\u201d that passes over a sea of outstretched hands reaching out from the depths of hell, and the \u201cgates of heaven,\u201d guarded by Death and Rahu, two creatures who decide the fates of the dead.\nAlthough originally built in 1997, the sprawling temple in Chiang Rai, a city in northern Thailand, remains a work in progress and has not yet reached completion. Over the years Kositpipat has added other white structures to the property, each with its own unique architectural style. Interestingly enough, the spot that receives most of the attention is the restroom, housed inside a building covered in gold leaf.\nWat Phra Si Sanphet\nWat Phra Si Sanphet (istock/Syolacan)\nLocated in Ayutthaya, a former Siam capital that dates back to roughly 1350, Wat Phra Si Sanphet is one of the few temples situated within the boundaries of a Unesco Heritage site . It was built during the reign of Ramathibodi I, king of Ayutthaya, and, unlike other temples, it served as the royal monastery and has never been occupied by monks. Unfortunately, many of the temple\u2019s most striking decorative touches have been either destroyed or lost to the sands of time, most notably a 52-foot tall Buddha sculpture coated in gold that Burmese invaders removed and melted down. However much of the original structure still remains, including the three bell-shaped pagodas flanking the temple.\nWat Pho\nWat Pho (istock/Toondelamour)\nAlso known as Wat Prachetuphon Vimon Mangkararam, Wat Pho is perhaps best known for the massive reclining Buddha sculpture housed inside its hallowed walls. Stretching more than 150 feet in length, the sculpture\u2019s feet alone stand at 16 feet in height, and each are inlaid with mother of pearl and spiritual carvings related to Buddha and his teachings. The temple complex is also home to the first public university in Thailand, still fully operational today and serving as the home of the Thai Traditional Medical School.\nWat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew\nWat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew (istock/Sushi7688)\nWhen a group of monks in Si Sa Ket, a province located in southeastern Thailand, wanted to build a new temple, they sought the help of locals to provide them with building materials, according to Tourism Thailand . Their request: empty beer bottles.\nKnown as the Temple of a Million Bottles, Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew is comprised of approximately 1.5 million Heineken and Chang (a popular Thai lager) bottles. Since beginning the project in 1984, after Phra Khru Vivek Dharmajahn, the temple\u2019s founder, happened upon a nearby dumping ground overflowing with tossed bottles, the monks have continually added new structures to the temple complex, constructing a chapel, water towers, a crematorium, housing for the monks and an entrance gate comprised of the green and brown glass bottles, writes The Nation .\nWat Chantaram\nWat Chantaram (istock/NexTser)\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Wat Chantaram (also known as Wat Tha Sung) is often referred to as the Glass Temple. The interior of the sacred space, which is located in west-central Thailand, calls to mind a house of mirrors like the ones typically found inside a fun house. Decorated with dozens of glass columns that reflect the light, the columns lead up to a giant golden Buddha that replicates the original Phra Phuttha Chinnarat statue, found at another temple, Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat, and regularly referred to as \u201cthe most beautiful image of Buddha in Thailand.\u201d\nWat Phra Dhammakaya\nWat Phra Dhammakaya (istock/Intek1)\nA half century ago the land where Wat Phra Dhammakaya sits was nothing more than a rice field, according to the Dhammakaya Foundation , the organization headquartered there. But today it\u2019s home to one of the largest temple complexes in the country. Established in 1970, the sprawling property sits just outside of Bangkok and serves as a regular pilgrimage point for Buddhists seeking enlightenment and to practice meditation. The pinnacle of the temple is the Dhammakaya Cetiya, a massive domed structure that looks eerily similar to a spaceship. Measuring 105 feet in height and 354 feet in diameter, the cetiya \u201ccontains a sacred image of the Buddha in solid gold\u201d along with one million images of the Buddha throughout the space, according to the book New Buddhist Movements in Thailand .\nLike this article?\nAbout Jennifer Nalewicki\nJennifer Nalewicki is a Brooklyn-based journalist.

Built on an epic scale, Borobudur has survived nearby Gunung Merapi\u2019s frequent volcanic eruptions, terrorist bombings and the massive 2006 earthquake. Towering high above the iconic green rice fields this monumental structure puts Indonesia\u2019s other temples in the shade with its sheer scale. Built in the 9th century, this massive construction featured a stepped pyramid design covered in ornate carving. Borobudur\u2019s expansive central dome is crowned by 72 openwork stupas each containing its own statue of Buddha, set atop five concentric square terraces adorned with serried statues. Today, this majestic building is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nLocation: Central Java\nTips:\nAvoid weekends and public holidays as it can get very crowded.\nBring water and wear comfortable clothes and shoes to climb up the temple.\n2. Prambanan\nThis temple has eight major and eight minor temple clusters.\nThe Prambanan or \u201cmany priests\u201d temple is the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia. Prambanan was built in the year 850 and today the temple complex is being reconstructed. One of the most imposing features are the scattered ruins of Prambanan\u2019s 224 outer temples. As visitors enter the heart of the temple complex, they discover eight major and eight minor temple clusters. Their elaborately carved stupas praise Trimurti, a manifestation of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer.\nLocation: Yogyakarta , about two hours East from Borobodur\nOpening time: 6:00 am to 5:00 pm\nTips:\nVisit early mornings or late afternoons to avoid the tourist crush.\nGo on a trip through Indonesia\u2019s volcanoes and temples with this tour .\nPura Tanah Lot is only accesible during low tide.\nSculpted into a picturesque rock outcrop jutting out into the sea, Purah Tanah Lot temple is visited by thousands of visitors each year.

This beautiful temple is possibly the most photographed location on Bali, particularly its delightful sunsets.\nOpening time: 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. However, the temple can only be reached during low tide so check on the temple\u2019s accessibility before heading out.\nTips:\nTry to time your visit to coincide with the sunset.\nWhile entering the temple is not allowed to visitors, one can receive blessings from the shrine at the bottom of the rock.\nAs is the custom, after you've received the temple blessings, prepare to donate a small amount back to the temple.\nTake this tour of Bali and visit the Tanah Lot at sunset to enjoy the scenery.\n4. Pura Ulun Danu Beratan\nUlun Danu Bratan is a temple iconic to Bali.\nSet on Bali\u2019s magical Lake Bratan, its cool air and drifting fog imbue this temple with a mystical atmosphere. Pura is a Balinese word, which means temple. Nestling among peaks, the Ulun Danu Beratan temple has been serving Bali\u2019s local Hindu residents since 1633. The temple was designed to praise Dewi Danu, the goddess of lakes, rivers and water.\nLocation: Lake Bratan, Bali\nTips:\nAim to arrive early in the morning after sunrise when the lake is at its calmest and the reflections of the temple and mountain on the lake is at their best.\nYou can\u2019t miss out on Pura Beratan while on a trip to Bali.

Uluwatu Temple\nSitting on top a 70 meter high cliff, the Pura Luhur Uluwatu temple offers outstanding views of the sea and is also known as a 'sea temple'\nThis temple located at the edge of the 70 meter high cliff is as famous for its stunning sunsets as it is for the large group of monkeys that inhabit the place. It is said that the temple was expanded from a small shrine to a much larger temple area in the 11th century by a Javanese sage. The temple has stunning architecture similar to other Hindu temples in Bali and is one of the six principle temples of the island believed to protect the island from evil. The temple also displays Balinese Kecak and fire dance at sunset.\nLocation: South Kuta, Bali\nTip:\nBe careful of the monkeys, they are known to snatch bags, sunglasses and purses from visitors.\nVisit the temple during sunset to enjoy the traditional dance and sunset simultaneously.\nTake this 5-day Bali tour and visit Uluwatu temple as part of the trip.\n6.

Named after the tropical pandan tree, this 8.5-metre-high candi was built in the 8th century and sits on a 16.5-hectare site on the edge of a picturesque lake.

The scenery and serene mountain vibe makes it a memorable experience. The first Gedong Pitoe contains seven of the temples.

            "Nov\n09\nNovember 09, 2016\nWe asked Brett, our local guide in Bali , what\u2019s with all the temples everywhere on the island \u2014 and how to be respectful when you visit one.\n\u201cThere seems to be temples everywhere!\u201d That\u2019s what travellers always say to me. And, well, yes, they are everywhere \u2014 small shrines in offices, shops and houses, bigger temples for villages and regions and states throughout the whole island.\nBalinese are not Hindu, as is thought by almost everyone. They actually practice and follow a mix of three religions that only became merged as one in the 12th century.\nIt started in the 8th century, when the first Shiva Hindu priests arrived on Bali after travelling through Myanmar, Cambodia, Sumatra, and Java in a search that was passed down over generations for six centuries. They were searching for a place similar to their homeland of Mahabalipuram, an area near Chennai, India.\nOn Bali, they finally found what they had been seeking (this is also the reason why there is no Hindu influence east of Bali). The priests brought the artistry of carving and the knowledge of cultivation, which we can see in some of the UNESCO temples that seem like they\u2019ve been copied and pasted from Cambodia (and that aren\u2019t typically visited by tourists). On a walk with me a few days ago at Borobudur, a world-leading archaeologist pointed out that it\u2019s easy to see the carving influence from India \u2014 one clue is that the breasts on the women in the carvings are larger than those of the typical Indonesian body type!\nWhen the priests arrived back in the 8th century, they found the locals already had a cultural tradition known simply as \u201crespect your ancestor\u201d \u2014 a tradition found throughout Asia. The priests suggested that the inhabitants of Bali could follow the Shiva teachings and ways of life but in their own way. This soft approach meant that Hinduism flourished.\nIn the 10th century, in the founding village, the priests then built what was quite possibly the only working Hindu\u2013Buddhist temple in Southeast Asia. Then, some 200 years on (over coffee, I\u2019m sure), the three leaders of Hinduism, Buddhism, and the \u201crespect your ancestor\u201d tradition decided it was time to stop trying to be better, or the best, or the most common religion, and instead why not become one? After seven meetings, spaced out one every six months, they finally created Bali Darma or Balinese Hindu.\nAs a result, the Balinese have many temples and many different ceremonies, because they are really honouring three religions rolled into one. The name of Bali actually comes from the temple in India, Balipuram, or small Bali.\nNote that if you visit any of the temples on Bali, you must dress modestly, and as a tourist, you can only enter with the permission of the village or the local priest. There are many temples used for different purposes, some just for worship, some for cremation, and some for specific ceremonies throughout the year.\nThere are also a few rules specifically for women \u2014 they\u2019re not allowed to enter a temple while menstruating. While I realise that this might seem sexist, as though the Balinese place men as more superior, but that\u2019s not actually the case at all. The reasoning behind this rule is that no blood, from any source, is allowed to be spilled in a temple. It is not a rule against women, but about flowing blood. It\u2019s an ancient custom that is about protecting the temple and honouring the gods, and is not about anything else. Women will be asked before they enter whether they are menstruating, and while of course it\u2019s up to you how you answer, please respect the reasoning behind it. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be treated poorly if the answer is yes! It\u2019s very much a normal question and practice for the people of Bali.\nLastly, you\u2019ll likely see little square things everywhere throughout Bali, all filled with flowers, cigarettes, cookies, rice, and more. You\u2019ll see them on the streets in front of shops, streets, houses \u2014 everywhere, every day! This is an offering that locals do three times a day, to say thanks to the gods and to show respect for what they have given us. Once an offering has been placed, you can walk on it, move it, throw it away, no problem. So don\u2019t panic when you see people walking over these offerings, or cars driving over top of them in the streets!\nRELATED POSTS\nA Simple Guide to Thai Temple Etiquette\nLonely Planet Best in Travel 2020: What not to miss according to locals\nWhere To Find the Best Chendol in Penang\nStep back in time for a 1,000 year old Japanese sweet treat\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

            "Mar\n23\nMarch 23, 2020\nWhile the rules of exactly what you can or can\u2019t wear might vary from temple to temple, the basic rule is to dress modestly. This means at the very least covering your shoulders and knees. This is about being respectful so it\u2019s more appropriate to wear a t-shirt than to wrap a scarf over a sleeveless vest, although that may be permitted. Likewise, it\u2019s better to wear longer trousers or skirts than to loosely wrap a beach sarong over your shorts. Think of it like meeting your mother-in-law for the first time or going to church on a Sunday. We\u2019re not suggesting you put on a suit and tie, but loose, lightweight, long clothing is both respectful and cool in the hot and humid Bangkok climate.\nDress requirements to enter the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew are particularly strict. Ensure your clothes cover your shoulders and waist (scarves or shawls worn over sleeveless tops are not permitted). Trousers must be ankle-length, and skirts below the knee. It is also not permitted to wear ripped, torn or see-through clothes or items that are very tight fitting such as yoga pants or leggings. Shoes should be removed where indicated by signs (or where you see others have left their shoes), usually to enter any of the buildings. Hats and sunglasses should also be removed although it doesn\u2019t always say so.\nKeep Calm and Quiet\nThink of a temple like a library. People (including monks) may be praying, meditating or calmly contemplating Buddhist philosophy. Locals may also be here to observe the beauty of the surroundings just like you. Either way, treat them with respect by trying not to get in their way or disturb them unnecessarily.\nAvoid overt shows of emotion, whether excitement, frustration or affection \u2013 public displays of affection are a no-no anywhere in Thailand and even more so within a temple. Put your phone on silent, don\u2019t shout out to your friend if they\u2019re far away or run across the courtyard to catch up with them, and while you don\u2019t have to whisper, it\u2019s polite to keep the volume of your conversation low.\nAs with dressing appropriately, behaving appropriately demonstrates your respect for your environment and the local culture.\nShow Respect for the Monks and the Buddha\nThe Buddha is considered sacred in Thailand; it\u2019s seen as disrespectful to have a Buddha image in a bar, bathroom, printed on t-shirts or as tattoos. You might see plenty of Buddha souvenirs in other parts of Asia, but in Thailand it isn\u2019t appropriate.\nYou shouldn\u2019t touch Buddha statues, or lean or sit on their pedestals or other temple structures such as chedis (stupas) \u2013 they may have Buddha relics or someone\u2019s remains within them. We wouldn\u2019t rest against a headstone or memorial at home \u2013 these structures within temples should be respected in the same way.\nKeep a reasonable distance from Buddha images and rather than turning your back on them in close proximity, it\u2019s polite to back away a little before you turn to leave. Selfies with Buddha images are inappropriate for this reason.\nMonks are also revered in Thailand, and while many are quite friendly and might be happy to chat with visitors, you should treat them with the same kind of respect as you would a teacher when you were at school. Most importantly, if you\u2019re a woman don\u2019t touch the monks. If a monk is walking towards you it\u2019s also polite to step to the side to allow them to pass.\nIt\u2019s generally acceptable to take photographs of Buddha statues (or images as they\u2019re referred to in Thailand) and of areas of worship unless there\u2019s a sign telling you not to, but just like anywhere you travel, it\u2019s polite to ask people if they mind having their photograph taken, including monks.\nDon\u2019t Point\nIn Thai culture pointing with the index finger is considered impolite. When you\u2019re in a temple and want to point out some interesting details to your friends or ask your guide about something you see, it\u2019s easy to forget this. The local way is to use all four fingers to gesture in the right direction with the palm facing up.\nEqually important in Thai culture is not to point your feet towards the Buddha \u2013 you\u2019ll see that local people sit with their feet tucked towards the back of the room. They don\u2019t put their feet up on tables or a spare chair opposite them and its good practice to try to remember to do the same.\nMaking Donations\nYou\u2019ll see donation boxes in temples which local people will donate to as part of their merit-making practices. For this reason, where entrance fees are charged to tourists, the locals don\u2019t need to pay. They will very often make greater donations than the entrance fees that are charged. These donations should be used for the maintenance of the temple, to support the monks. and for community projects as well. It\u2019s not compulsory to donate, but if you\u2019ve visited a temple without an entrance fee and enjoyed the experience, you could drop some money in the box.\nBrowse Now\nWhere to watch football in Vienna\nLonely Planet Best in Travel 2020: What not to miss according to locals\nThe 10 Most Romantic Tours in North America\n11 Most Romantic Tours in Europe\nSign up for our newsletter & get $10 off your first tour\n"

The monument also reminds us the fulfillment of MacArthur\u2019s iconic words and promise \u201cI shall return\u201d. The fulfillment of that promise was the start of the Leyte invasion and his campaign to liberate the Philippines from the Japanese occupation during the World War II.\nThis historic event also led to the naval battle between the Japanese Imperial Navy and the US Navy (with the help from the Australian Royal Navy).

The guts and bravery of the Filipinos who fought during the battle sent a warning to Spain that their colonization of the Philippines will soon be over.\nThe five-hectare Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine includes the Museo ng Katipunan, the Battle of Pinaglabanan statue (statue of a woman supported by two children, holding up a bolo), and the monument of the Spirit of Pinaglabanan (the shrine\u2019s centerpiece which is a statue of elongated figures created by Edgardo Castrillo).\u00a0For more interesting information about the shrine, read 15 Reasons to Visit Museo ng Katipunan-Pinaglabanan Memorial Shrine .\n10. Balangiga Encounter Monument\nLocation: Balangiga, Eastern Samar\nDate built: September 28, 2003\nDedicated to: The heroism of the local freedom fighters in Samar\nWhy you should visit it:\nThe Balangiga Encounter Monument reminds us that Filipinos will not back down to fight for freedom against any foreign invader \u2013 even against the mighty American forces.\nOn September 28, 1901, the church bells of Balangiga were rung to signal an attack by native bolo fighters from Balangiga and the nearby villages of Lawaan, Giporlos and Quinapondan that killed more than 50 US soldiers. The encounter, popularly known as the Balangiga masacre, was described as the United States Army\u2019s worst defeat during the Philippine-American War.\nThe attack outraged Gen. Jacob Smith and instructed his men to kill all Filipinos who were capable of bearing arms, including boys over 10 years old. Thousands of locals were killed and homes were burned under Smith\u2019s order.\nThe historic bells of the church at Balangiga were taken by the Americans as war booty. The bells have not yet returned to the town\u2019s church even up to this day.\n11. Edsa Shrine\nThe statue of Our Lady of Peace in EDSA Shrine, Ortigas Center, Quezon City. Photo by FAQ.ph\nBasic information:\nLocation: Ortigas Center, EDSA corner Ortigas Avenue, Ugong Norte, Quezon City\nDesigner: Various artists\nDate built: 1989\nDedicated to: The peaceful outcome of the People Power Revolution in 1986\nWhy you should visit it:\nThe EDSA Shrine was originally built to commemorate the events during the People Power Revolution and its peaceful outcome. The People Power Revolution (also called the EDSA Revolution or the Philippine Revolution of 1986) was a series of nonviolent demonstrations joined by over two million Filipino civilians including several political, military and religious personalities on February 22-25, 1986.\nThe people power revolution caused the departure of the dictator President Ferdinand Marcos and the restoration of the country\u2019s democracy.\nThe Shrine includes the seven-meter bronze statue of Our Lady of Peace, sculpted by Virginia Ty-Navarro . It has also two chapels \u2013 the San Lorenzo Ruiz Chapel and the Chapel of Perpetual Adoration \u2013 where catholic devotees can offer a prayer.\n12. People Power Monument\nThe People Power Monument located in the corner of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) and White Plains Avenue in Barangay Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City. Photo by Ramon FVelasquez at Wikimedia Commons .\nBasic information:\nLocation: Corner of EDSA and White Plains Avenue in Barangay Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City\nDesigner: Eduardo Castrillo\nDate built: 1993\nDedicated to: The brave Filipinos who marched on the streets of EDSA during the People Power Revolution in 1986\nWhy you should visit it:\nThe monument is about 0.89 kilometers from the EDSA Shrine. I think it\u2019s a great monument to represent the People Power Revolution or EDSA Revolution in 1986.\nThe Filipinos earned the respect of the world when they successfully demonstrated the power of the people without using violence to end dictatorship and regain democracy in the Philippines.\nFinal thoughts\nThe historic monuments and shrines in the Philippines should remind us about the bravery, struggles and sacrifices made by Filipinos over hundreds of years to achieve the freedom that we enjoy today.\nIn the past, they took care of our independence.

It is the residence of Japan's Imperial Family .\nEdo Castle used to be the seat of the Tokugawa shogun who ruled Japan from 1603 until 1867 . In 1868 , the shogunate was overthrown, and the country's capital and Imperial Residence were moved from Kyoto to Tokyo . In 1888 construction of a new Imperial Palace was completed. The palace was once destroyed during World War Two , and rebuilt in the same style, afterwards.\nNijubashi Bridge\nFrom Kokyo Gaien, the large plaza in front of the Imperial Palace, visitors can view the Nijubashi, two bridges that form an entrance to the inner palace grounds.

            "Iconic places and famous landmarks in Malaysia\nThe glimmering Petronas Tower soaring high above the Kuala Lumpur skyline. A mosque floating almost magically above the water in Melaka. Malaysia, that Southeast Asian country renowned for its incredible cuisine and some of the globe\u2019s friendliest people, is also well-known for some of its iconic buildings. From street art epicentre Penang to Langkawi , bustling Kuala Lumpur to small town Ipoh and places like Borneo, the Cameron Highlands and everywhere in between, we asked some of the world\u2019s leading travel bloggers to help us count down the most prominent places and iconic landmarks in Malaysia.\nSkip ahead\nPetronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur\nStreet Art in George Town, Penang\nChrist Church, Melaka\nBatu Caves, Kuala Lumpur\nThe Sky Bridge, Langkawi\nThe Floating Mosque, Melaka\nKek Lok Si Temple, Penang\nPetronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by James from The Travel Scribes\nNo list of landmarks in Malaysia would be complete without its crowning jewel: The Petronas Towers. They stand tall as the tallest twin towers in the world, reaching over 450 metres high, and between 1998 and 2004 even topped the list as the tallest buildings in the world outright.\nThe towers represent more than just a tall building to Malaysians \u2013 they were envisioned to symbolize the country\u2019s ambition to be a global powerhouse, with the use of glittering glass and steel styled to mimic Islamic art motifs, a nod to the dominant religion in Malaysia. Completed in 1996, the building work faced a number of challenges in the 3 years it took: decayed limestone foundations which meant the entire building site had to be moved, issues with the concrete failing strength tests and an increased cost for importing steel, which meant the construction team had to rely on a different method, super high-strength reinforced concrete.\nSituated at Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, today the Towers provide office space to anchor tenant, Petronas, as well as companies like Bloomberg, Boeing, IBM and Microsoft. It\u2019s also a huge tourist attraction as visitors can visit the world\u2019s highest two storey bridge, the Skybridge, and the Observation Deck on the 86th floor. And if you love to shop, you can get your fix at the Suria Shopping Centre.\nDid you know? The Petronas Towers has a great history of extreme sports. In April 1999 Felix Baumgartner set the world record for base jumping there and in 2009, French climber Alain \u201cSpiderman\u201d Robert made it to the top of Tower II\u00a0using only his bare hands and feet!\nBatu Caves, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by Rai from A Rai of Light\nA highlight of any visit to Kuala Lumpur is a visit to the 400 million year old Batu Caves . These limestone hills housing Hindu temples and shrines play an important role in the lives of the people that call this region home and provides a glimpse into their history and culture.\nA massive statue of Lord Murugan, one of the largest in the world, stands guard at the entrance. Follow in the footsteps of pilgrims to climb the numerous steps and reach a cave filled with interesting formations and religious monuments. This vantage point also offers a good view of the city below. This temple is simple but beautifully designed, surrounded by a large number of monkeys that also call this area home. Fortunately it is pretty easy to get here from the city centre and a visit to the caves is sure to be time well-spent.\nThe George Town Street Art, Penang\nExplored by Sarah and Justin from Travel Breathe Repeat\nGeorge Town is an iconic destination in Malaysia due in large part to its street art. The street art in George Town is some of the best in the world. After an epic journey from Thailand to Malaysia , we spent a few incredibly fun days in the city eating delicious food and hunting for these beautiful and interesting murals.\nThe street art in George Town is especially unique because so many of the pieces are interactive. You can hold a rope in the mouth of an enormous, lifelike tiger. Or sit on a motorcycle, taking the place of the boy painted on the wall.\nThe artwork is also interesting because they\u2019re so well integrated into their surroundings. A penguin looks like he\u2019s standing on a pipe as he spray paints the wall you\u2019re looking at. Two kids hang out of a painted window next to a real door of a shop.\nYou can find the most famous pieces on a George Town street art map or even join a guided tour. Even if you do this, though, you should also just keep constant lookout for the cheeky paintings hiding all over the city. It\u2019s a joy to spot the animals and children popping out of unexpected places and contributes to making George Town a truly fun place to explore.\nThe Pavilion Building, Kuching, Sarawak\nExplored by Wendy from The Nomadic Vegan\nA multicultural place that is home to many different ethnicities, the far-flung state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo has a history that\u2019s quite different from Penang and other tourist hotspots in peninsular Malaysia. Easily recognizable by its box-like shape, the Pavilion Building is an iconic landmark of Sarawak\u2019s unique colonial history. Originally part of Brunei, what is now Sarawak was given to a British adventurer named James Brooke, who ruled it as his own personal kingdom. He and his successors are known collectively as the White Rajahs. It was during the reign of the White Rajahs that the Pavilion Building was built in 1907, originally as a hospital.\nThis was the first public building constructed in the city that was more than two stories tall. While it has since been surpassed by a number of skyscrapers, it remains one of the most striking landmarks in Kuching. Nowadays, it houses the Sarawak Textile Museum, which displays textiles handwoven by members of the various ethnic groups that live in Sarawak.\nKota Kinabalu City Mosque,\nExplored by Arrianne from Travel Habeat\nThe largest one in the city of Kota Kinabalu , Kota Kinabalu City Mosque can hold 12,000 worshippers at once. Mainly white, it is decorated by a blue and gold dome. Kota Kinabalu City Mosque is simply stunning on its own, embodying a contemporary Islamic architecture. But what makes it utterly unique, is the presence of the man-made lagoon surrounding it. It is sometimes called \u201cThe Floating Mosque\u201d because of the illusion from afar that it sits atop the still water.\nBut its charm doesn\u2019t end there. Wait until the blue hour strikes and Kota Kinabalu City Mosque will take your breath away. Its beautiful reflection illuminates the water. As such, it has actually become a sought-after Malaysian landmark for photographers exploring the area. Non-Muslims can enter the mosque outside regular praying times but proper clothing must be strictly observed. Costing you a few Malaysian Ringgit, there are available robes for rent in case you need one.\nAlluring as it is, Kota Kinabalu City Mosque is no doubt one of the most iconic landmarks not only in the city but in the entire country as well.\nThe Khoo Kongsi Clanhouse, Penang\nExplored by James from Where You\u2019re Between\nPenang\u2019s large Chinese community has left a huge cultural mark on the city. Nowhere is this more evident than at the stunning Khoo Kongsi clanhouse, right in the heart of Penang .\nChinese communities frequently established clanhouses in various cities all over Asia to help new arrivals from the homeland settle overseas. Penang\u2019s Khoo Kongsi clanhouse is one of many in the city and easily the most spectacular. Hidden amongst a private square, this Malaysian landmark is set away from the hustle and bustle of central Penang. And at the heart of the complex is the clanhouse\u2019s breath-taking main hall, decorated in stunning detail.\nUnderneath its hugely elaborate sloping roof, the hall\u2019s columns and veranda are adorned with incredible intricately carved stonework. Inside, altars are decorated in glistening gold leaf whilst the walls are covered in ancient murals that depict ancient tales from Chinese folklore.\nOpposite the main hall is an open air theatre that is still used to host Chinese operas. Around the edge of the clanhouse\u2019s courtyard are sixty terraced houses, built in the 1900s as homes for members of the clan. Some of these homes have since been converted to excellent accommodation and make a great place to stay right in the historic centre of Penang.\nSri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by Shireen\u00a0from The Happy Days Travels\nWhen visiting a place that has large religious communities, I find it\u2019s important to learn about those religions and cultures, so I try to visit somewhere that provides this education. I did this frequently during my three weeks travelling Malaysia which included visiting Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Borneo.\nOne of the iconic religious landmarks to visit in Kuala Lumpur is the Hindu Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the oldest Hindu temple in Kuala Lumpur having been founded in 1873. The impressive architecture boasts a 5 tier tower, making it unmissable as you\u2019re walking the neighbourhood. Reflecting the diversity and multiculturalism of not only KL but also the country, you\u2019ll find other temples and a mosque in the surrounding area.\nSri Mahamariamman Temple is open to visitors (Hindus and Non-Hindus) where you can walk around admiring the intricate details of the architecture. There is usually music to be heard and ceremonies/practices to be observed. Entry to the temple is free but there is a small fee for safe storage of your shoes, like many places of worship in Southeast Asia, shoes are not allowed inside the temple.\nThis iconic landmark in Malaysia is special to visit because it allows you to observe practices from the Hindu religion as well as gain insight into a massive part of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s diversity.\nOld Town Street Art, Ipoh\nExplored by James from The Travel Scribes\nIf you ask tourists and travellers about their favourite experiences in Malaysia, many will mention walking the streets and exploring the amazing street art of the country. George Town, Penang will usually be at the top of the list, but I\u2019d like to make a punt for my beloved street art hotspot and undiscovered gem: Ipoh.\nThe street art in Ipoh might not be as expansive as Penang but you definitely won\u2019t be jockeying for position among thousands of other tourists, as Ipoh is still a little off the beaten traveller trail. A town originally founded around tin mining, residents left in droves in the late 20th century, with the decline of that industry. It\u2019s only in the last few years that tourism has brought more people back to Ipoh and alongside it\u2019s famous \u2018white coffee\u2019 and incredible hawker food stalls, street art is one of the major drawcards.\nThe first pieces of art were created by prolific street artist, Ernest Zacharevic, a Lithuanian-born artist who has become known as the \u2018Banksy\u2019 of Malaysia. He travelled to Ipoh to work with Old Town White Coffee, a coffee chain, to create a set of six murals across the city and, from there, the culture of street art took hold in Ipoh. To get a true feel for the art, you simply need to walk around the old town or head to the Mural Arts Lane, an alley in the newer part of town dedicated to the art.\nJonker Street, Melaka\nExplored by Yen from the Wandering Journal\nJonker Street, (or Jalan Jonker) is probably the most visited street in Melaka, has been around for centuries, dating back to the Dutch colonial era. After the Dutch left, the Peranakans settled down in this area, leaving behind the Nyonya Baba-influenced architecture and culture as we see today.\nWandering around Jonker Street is one of the best things to do in Melaka . Moreover, the street is located perpendicular to the Melaka River which also offers a river cruise to explore the surrounding area, including the amazing Kampung Morten.\nBut what\u2019s so special about Jonker Street? Well, it might look like an ordinary street in the day, with several concept stores and restaurants along the street. When the sun goes down on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the street is quickly transformed into a vibrant night market with plenty of stalls filling up the street.\nIt\u2019s easily the busiest street in Melaka at that time, attracting visitors from all around the city. Even people from Kuala Lumpur drive all the way down there for a weekend getaway trip.\nTo visit Jonker Street, there are a lot of accommodations all along the Melaka River, which makes your visit effortless. Backpacker hostels, luxury hotels, you can find accommodations of all ranges.\nPay a visit to the night market and enjoy the experience!\nThe Floating Mosque, Melaka\nExplored by Rose from Where Goes Rose\nOne of the most unique and impressive things to do in Melaka is visit Melaka Straits Mosque, otherwise known as the Floating Mosque. This large mosque built beside the ocean gives the impression it\u2019s floating on the water, although it actually rests on stilts.\nUnlike many of the historical buildings in sleepy Melaka, the Floating Mosque was only built in 2006. The primary religion in Malaysia is Islam, and this mosque is a great example of Islamic landmarks in Malaysia. There are also large Indian and Chinese communities who worship at their own Hindu and Taoist temples, providing the country with a rich multicultural mix.\nGoing inside the mosque is free but you should have your knees and shoulders covered to be respectful. Even if you don\u2019t go inside, you should take a trip to Melaka Straits Mosque to view the impressive building from the outside. Melaka Straits Mosque is a 10-minute drive from Melaka and can easily be reached by hailing a taxi or calling a Grab (Malaysia\u2019s version of Uber).\nCheong Fatt Tze\u2019s Mansion, Penang\nExplore by Claire from Claire\u2019s Footsteps\nPenang is often a must-do on people\u2019s Malaysia itinerary because of the delicious food, however it\u2019s well worth exploring for its rich and varied history and architecture as well. Cheong Fatt Tze\u2019s mansion, or \u2018the blue mansion\u2019 is one of the best preserved historical buildings on the island.\nIt was built by the wealthy self-made Chinese millionaire, Cheong Fatt Tze. He was born into a poor Chinese Hakka family and left after the Second Opium War, when the country was plunged into poverty. He moved to Indonesia, where he started lucrative rubber and tea businesses that made his fortune. Subsequently, he built this house in Penang, using Feng Shui and other Chinese interior design techniques, to create a really distinct house.\nOne of his best examples of this is his courtyard, which was open and would flood in rain. This was on purpose \u2013 in Chinese culture rain brings money.\nIt has been used for various films throughout the years, most notably Crazy Rich Asians where it is the setting for the mah jong scene.\nThe house is now open for guided tour only (which get excellent reviews), these tours take about 45 minutes, and suprisingly it also functions as a hotel! There is a bar, restaurant and gift shop on-site. Check at the house for tour times, as they do change.\nKuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park\nIn the heart of the bustling capital of Malaysia lies a small stretch of rain forest\u00a0called Kuala Lumpur Forest Eco Park. This is the last remaining section of rain forest\u00a0within the city itself and holds the title of the oldest forest reserve in the country. Making it an important iconic landmark in Malaysia.\nWithin KL Forest Eco Park, there are a range of walking and hiking trails that are great for passing by an afternoon, one of which is a 200m canopy walk allowing for a relaxing 20 minute walk amongst the tree tops.\nThe combination of the nature with the backdrop of a city is a great mix and well worth a visit. If you want to get an even better birds eye view of the city, KL Tower is located right near the entrance to the par with a viewing deck taller than the\u00a0Petronas Twin Towers.\nAs of Jan 2020, they have begun charging an entry fee which is a shame but is vital for the upkeep of this vital green space.\nThe Sky Bridge, Langkawi\nExplored by Cal from Once in a Lifetime Journey\nOn a trip to this popular island along the west coast of Malaysia you will most likely spend most of your time on the beach, basking in the sun, cocktail in hand, in one of the most luxurious resorts in Langkawi .\nYet you\u2019ll be missing out if you don\u2019t go up one of its most famous landmarks, the Langkawi Sky Bridge. While walking on the 125m long curved cable bridge 660m up above the island is a must, just going up the cable car to get there is an adventure in itself. It is the world\u2019s steepest cable car! While the queues can get intense during weekends and peak season, you\u2019ll forget all about it as the views are breath-taking.\nOnce you\u2019re at the top of the cable car, get your camera ready for some epic shots. Then either walk down the slightly steep path for around 10 minutes or take the SkyGlide cabin down to the bridge for an additional few Malaysian Ringgit. The SkyGlide takes around 2 mins. It really is amazing to see Langkawi from up above with all the gorgeous surrounding islands and azure oceans.\nLexis Hibiscus, Port Dickson\nPhoto Credit @ Lexis Hotel Group\nYou might be surprised to find a resort hotel on a list of top landmarks in Malaysia but the Lexis Hibiscus is undoubtedly an interesting design and the most unique building in Malaysia.\nJust 45 minutes away from Kuala Lumpur International Airport is this fascinating resort complex which draws couples and families from around the world, all looking to stay in their private pool facilities. Why? Well the property has pool villas radiating out in the shape of a hibiscus, the national flower of Malaysia. Best seen from the air (or via a drone), its surely one of the most distinctive hotel designs in the world.\nThe resort definitely wanted to top not just the architectural stakes but also set a few records in the process. They hold the Guinness World Record for the most swimming pools in a resort (its 643 by the way), and the record for most overwater villas at a single resort, with 552 top-notch villas.\nNext time you\u2019re looking for a great place to stay in Malaysia, add it to your list.\nSultan Abdul Samad Building, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by Lee from The Travel Scribes\nIt\u2019s a must-visit on any Kuala Lumpur itinerary , the Sultan Abdul Samad Building is part of the city\u2019s \u2018Colonial Core\u2019, a set of older colonial buildings that provide an interesting contrast to the many high rises and skyscrapers that now dominate the city centre.\nBuilt between 1894 and 1897, this beautiful Malaysian landmark used to be the home of many key government departments during the British rule of the country. It was originally planned to be built in a Classical Renaissance style but the State Engineer at the time, Charles Spooner, didn\u2019t like the style and reworked it to be almost Moorish in approach.\nNowadays the Sultan Abdul Samad Building houses the country\u2019s Ministry of Information, Communications and Culture but, more than this, provides the backdrop to the annual independence celebrations as Malaysians converge on Merdeka Square (Dataran Merdeka) in front of it each year for their Independence Day parades.\nKota Kinabalu National Park\nExplored by Penny from GlobeTrove\nBorneo is famous for a number of landmarks but if you are a fan of the great outdoors then Kota Kinabalu park is probably calling your name.\nThe park is centered around Mount Kota Kinabalu which is the tallest peak on the island and one that people come from far and wide to tackle. The summit however is more than a day\u2019s climb and you need to register as only a limited amount of people are allowed to trek up per day. If you aren\u2019t a big fan of long hikes, then don\u2019t ditch the park off your list just yet. There are numerous small trails that are perfect for a quiet peaceful walk. The forests of Borneo are diverse and interesting, so I highly recommend the visit.\nThe closest city is Kota Kinabalu and it is easy to get to as there are numerous flights that land here. While a lot of people love the islands that dot the coast around the city, the national park remains one of the top things to do in Kota Kinabalu . It was the highlight of our trip!\nKek Lok Si, Penang\nKek Lok Si is a stunning and enormous temple situated on a hilltop at Air Itam on the island of Penang (off the west coast of Malaysia). It is the country\u2019s largest Buddhist temple and every year thousands of people from across South East Asia visit Penang to worship at this landmark.\nThe temple construction was completed 115 years ago in 1905 and comprises of a series of monasteries, prayer halls, a tortoise pond, gift shops and beautifully landscaped gardens. One of the temple highlights is the impressive seven-storey Pagoda of Rama VI which holds 10,000 bronze and alabaster Buddha statues and has a mix of Chinese, Thai and Burmese architecture.\nAt the very top of the temple complex you will find a 30.2m high bronze statue of Kuan Yin (the Goddess of Mercy) and amazing views across the island.\nThe best time to visit Kek Lok Si temple is during the Chinese New Year celebrations, when the temple is illuminated with thousands of LED lights, and adorned with many colourful hanging lanterns.\nKek Lok Si opening hours are from 8.30am\u20135:30pm daily and admission is free, (except for a small charge of 3 MYR for the elevator and 2 MYR for pagoda entrance).\nDarul Hana Bridge and Sarawak State Assembly Building, Sarawak\nExplored by Fiona from Passport and Piano\nKuching makes a great place to stay if you are visiting Borneo in Malaysia and it\u2019s from here that you can fly to the famous Mulu Caves . From the town, you can easily take day trips to see the orangutans and visit Bako National Park, which is one of the best places to see proboscis monkeys.\nAround town, there\u2019s lots of great restaurants and some fantastic street art. At night most people head to the riverfront to watch the daily light show from the iconic Darul Hana bridge. The bridge is spectacular and looks beautiful when it\u2019s all lit up in bright colours at night. The bridge links the northern and southern parts of the city together. It\u2019s built in the shape of an \u201cS\u201d for Sarawak and the views across the river and spectacular.\nIf you walk across the bridge, you can walk along the esplanade to both the Fort Margherita and the Sarawak State building. Both are magnificent landmarks, but the golden roof of the state building is the one that will catch your eye.\nTo get the best views of the bridge, the Sarawak State building and the fort opt for a river ride in one of the traditional boats. You\u2019ll also pass the mosque, which is another beautiful building.\nJamek Mosque, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by Delilah from Our Travel Mix\nMasjid Jamek (Jamek Mosque) is the oldest mosque in Kuala Lumpur, having been built in 1909.\u00a0 It\u2019s Moorish architecture features stunning patterns on the facade of the building, patterned archways and large white domes.\nYou can visit this attraction during set hours, from 10am to 12.30pm and 2.30pm to 4pm daily, except Friday.\u00a0 This is to provide times for prayer without tourists. Being in the heart of Kuala Lumpur city, it\u2019s easy to get to Masjid Jamek by public transport.\nMasjid Jamek is an especially welcoming mosque, offering free entry for tourists, including personal guided tours around the complex.\u00a0 Many mosques allow tourists to visit, however, with a guided tour you will get to learn so much more about the Islam religion. The guides speak excellent English and are very enthusiastic.\nIt is also important to note that, as with all mosques, it is respectful to wear clothing that covers your shoulders and knees.\u00a0 If you aren\u2019t dressed appropriately, you can borrow a robe for free.\nCameron Highlands Tea Fields, Pahang\nExplored by Emily from Wander-Lush\nWhen it comes to iconic landmarks in Malaysia, it doesn\u2019t get much better than the verdant tea fields of the Cameron Highlands district. What makes this area so special is that it captures the many layers of Malaysia\u2019s charm: Natural beauty, colonial heritage, local produce.\nLocated in Pahang in the central part of peninsular Malaysia, the area is a natural plateau bounded by the Titiwangsa Mountains. The microclimate makes it the perfect place for raising tea and other crops, and in the 1930s, the area was developed by Malaysia\u2019s ruling British government for exactly this purpose.\nToday, Cameron Highlands is known for its tea estates, flower nurseries, strawberry farms and fruit orchards \u2013 all of which are a tourist magnet. The most iconic image of the Cameron Highlands is an undulating blanket of tea bushels that stretches out to the horizon against a backdrop of mountains. The best place to go for a view is Boh plantation, which has the largest slice of land \u2013 a massive 3,200 hectares of plants and processing facilities. There\u2019s also a tea room on-site that serves up a rather lovely cuppa.\nCameron Highlands can be visited from Kuala Lumpur or nearby Ipoh . You can see a lot of the area in a day, but I recommend staying a few nights to visit some of the smaller plantations and go trekking in the nearby rainforest. The most convenient place to base yourself is in the town of Tanah Rata, where you\u2019ll find a good range of accommodations and restaurants. If you can, try to avoid visiting on weekends and public holidays when the area is crowded with day trippers from KL.\nChrist Church, Melaka\nExplored by Bridget from the Flash Packer\nThe\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage city of Melaka bears testament to its rich history. From its humble beginnings as a fishing village founded by a Sumatran Hindu prince in the 14th Century, it was colonised by the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British before gaining independence in 1946.\nWe have the Dutch to thank for Melaka\u2019s iconic landmark, Christ Church,\u00a0one of the most photographed sites in the city and a must-see building in Malaysia . This distinctive 18thCentury church is built from pink-red laterite bricks shipped from Zeeland and its floor is studded with Dutch and Armenian tombstones. Christ Church\u2019s original pews remain, as do its massive 15-meter ceiling beams, each hewn from a single tree trunk.\nChrist Church is located on the town square by the riverfront, opposite Melaka\u2019s imposing Stadthuys. It is open from 8.30am \u2013 5pm and entry is free (but donation encouraged).\nA heads-up that Melaka can be ridiculously busy, particularly at weekends. To avoid the worst of the crowds wielding their selfie-sticks, visit early in the day.\nTaman Negara National Park\nTaman Negara National Park is a very special place in Malaysia. This is the most primitive virgin rainforest in the world, much older than the Amazonian forest! Scientists estimate that Taman Negara has more than 130 million years so if you love nature you cannot miss Taman Negara while you are visiting Malaysia.\nThis incredible rainforest is located 3 hour drive from Kuala Lumpur, the capital. Public transportation is scarce so we recommend arranging transportation with your accommodation in Taman Negara. We stayed in Mutian Taman Negara Resort, located in the heart of the jungle, and they propose a daily shared van for an additional fee.\nPeople visit Taman Negara for its outdoor activities. There are riverboat trips and many trails to enjoy the trees and plants of this incredible forest, being the canopy walkway the most popular one. Lucky hikers will be able to spot exotic animals and perhaps the largest flower of the world \u2013 the Rafflesia flower. The Rafflesia flower is rare, it takes six to nine months to bloom but only lasts three to four days and apparently it smells very bad!\nThean Hou Temple, Kuala Lumpur\nExplored by Lee from The Travel Scribes\nIt\u2019s one of the largest and most impressive Chinese temples in all of South East Asia, and we\u2019d probably count it as one of the most \u2018photogenic\u2019 we\u2019ve ever seen. The Thean Hou Temple, located just shy of the centre of Kuala Lumpur, is a magnificent example of Taoist, Confucianist and Buddhist culture and architecture that you must visit if checking out the Malaysian capital.\nIt\u2019s not actually that old, only being built in 1987 and opened in 1989, but it\u2019s a marvel of a building \u2013 six spectacular tiers all dedicated to the Chinese sea goddess, Mazu. You\u2019ll find an incredibly ornate roof, intricate pillars and carvings and every corner of this temple offers you a stunning view back over Kuala Lumpur, as it is conveniently situated high up on Robson Hill. Mostly decked out in accents of bright red, the colour that symbolises prosperity and good fortune, you\u2019ll often find beautiful lanterns strung up across the temple; particularly around Chinese New Year when the temple really comes to life.\nAs with most attractions in Malaysia, we\u2019d recommend arriving early before the tour groups, although the temple only opens at 9.00am.\nWhat do you think of our iconic places and famous landmarks in Malaysia list?

            "A humble burger joint opened by the folks behind Carvers & Co, Wolf Burgers has, over the last few years, risen through the ranks to become a popular choice among burger aficionados all over Singapore.\nThe brand is famous for a few things, but more notably for their affordable prices and undeniably delicious burgers.\nThis no-frills burger joint puts out some scrumptious, meat-packed options, with most items on the menu priced below S$10. And before you begin comparing them to any ordinary fast-food restaurant, let us assure you that the quality and satisfaction that Wolf Burgers guarantees go far beyond your average happy meal.\nIf you\u2019re a first-timer, perhaps it would not be a bad idea to start yourself off with their signature Wolf Burger (S$9.90). This anything-but-basic burger comprises a freshly ground beef patty with cheddar, sweet onions, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles in their house-made sesame seed bun.\nOur patty was beautifully cooked, achieving the perfect medium-rare. During the cooking, the cooks press the patties down hard against the griddle to achieve a deep and even crust, all while expertly flipping and timing each one to ensure that every patty is done just right.\nWhat we particularly enjoyed about the Wolf Burger, despite it being so simple and ordinary, was the fact that neither one of the ingredients were overly assertive, allowing us to truly appreciate the quality of the beef.\nEvery burger here is fully customisable, so feel free to exclude or include whatever you want from the type of cheese to their wide selection of toppings. We requested for some pickled gherkins to be added as well as we wanted something acidic to cut through the richness of the beef and melted cheese.\nFor an additional S$3, you can choose to upgrade to a meal that comprises any side item and a drink of your choice. There were quite a few interesting choices but the Sweet Potato Fries (S$4) seemed like the most enticing.\nCrispy from edge to edge, every shoestring of sweet potato brimmed with a deep caramelised flavour\u2014a quality that complemented our burger extremely well.\nIf you\u2019re a truffle fanatic, then our advice is to go for the Truffle Fries (S$6).\nThe notes of truffle were apparent and the fries were nicely textured, but all in all, it was rather underwhelming as compared to its sweet potato counterpart.\nWolf Burgers\nSingapore 486038\nSat & Sun: 11.30am \u2013 9.30pm\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nYou may use these HTML tags and attributes: <a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\"> <acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\"> <em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <strike> <strong>\nDesigned & Developed by PRODDDesign .\n"

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\nHidden restaurants in Singapore for a quiet and private experience\nHidden restaurants in Singapore for a quiet and private experience\nCheck out these off-the-grid joints that will make you feel like a bonafide insider\nPhotograph: The Dragon Chamber\nIn our\u00a0clustered cityscape \u2013 where dining spots and watering holes constantly jostle for space \u2013 these restaurants choose to remain deliberately hidden, all the better to provoke intrigue and pique your interest. Forget Google maps for the moment \u2013 you have to rely on your instincts and written instructions to get to these joints. Here are the secret eateries in Singapore that are only open to those in the know.\nBishan\nAt mealtimes, Omot\u00e9 draws a steady crowd. Many stand in line for its affordable Japanese fare, and in particular,\u00a0the chirashi don ($12.80) that\u2019s topped with freshly diced seafood. But there\u2019s another reason why people keep coming back \u2013 and it involves no queuing at all.\nThe reason: Omot\u00e9 Dining, an exclusive dining space that's hidden at the back of the restaurant, available only to those in the know. According to Lynette Tan from the business development team, the idea for this covert eatery was inspired by the many Japanese restaurants that are often hidden along side streets, or tucked away in quiet corners. Finding Omot\u00e9 Dining is part of its appeal. \u201cWe want to retain that element of surprise and adventure for diners,\u201d she says.\nAnd those that are privy to its low-key existence can look forward to an elegant meal, served in a Zen enclave outfitted with minimalist furnishings and ornate Japanese ceramics. \u201cOmot\u00e9 Dining embraces washouku,\u201d explains Lynette, a form of traditional Japanese cuisine centred around rice and side dishes made with seasonal ingredients. Here, head chef Nagae Toshiharu uses grains sourced from Niigata prefecture as a base for his set meals, or in the sushi omakase menu. It\u2019s an intimate, bespoke dining experience typically reserved for Omot\u00e9\u2019s regular customers, their friends, and now, you.\nRaffles Place\nChinese food is often mystified in Western films. It\u2019s portrayed as secretive, elusive, and at times, even a little sketchy, as noted by Norman Hartono. He wanted to incorporate that \"intrigue\" into Chinese dining here. \u201cWe want to modernise Chinese cuisine and reinvent the way people, especially the younger crowd, perceive it,\u201d says the creative director of the Ebb and Flow Group.\nSo the Group opened The Dragon Chamber.\u00a0It might look like a typical kopitiam at first glance, serving wonton mee and roast meats during the day, but it\u2019s when the sun sets that it truly comes alive. Camouflaged behind a fridge door is the real entrance to the darker, more mysterious restaurant \u2013 with old posters and chinoiserie\u00a0to\u00a0lend an underground vibe, one that's reminiscent of gang dens in old Hong Kong.\nThe neon-lit\u00a0interior is just the beginning. The menu, too, is full of surprises. Uncommon ingredients are celebrated, resulting in dishes\u00a0that include the Dragon Claw ($55), a crocodile paw braised in a herbal sauce; the theatrical Flaming Pineapple Beef ($30); and the D*** Soup ($30), where herbs are double-boiled with the reproductive organ of a male crocodile for over six hours.\nIt\u2019s a meal unlike any served in conventional Chinese restaurants. Norman shares: \u201cThe excitement of noticing a new detail or a trying out a new dish keeps the experience fresh.\u201d\nChinatown\nMusic lovers should bookmark Tempura Oji \u2013 not just for the food, as much as crunching into the deep-fried king tiger prawn ($19) give out a satisfying sound \u2013 but for its slick beats.\nThe sizzle from the tempura bar frying up spam ($10) or tempura moriawase ($19) might permeate the space in the day, but as dusk settles, techno tunes and house music starts to take over. It\u2019s\u00a0provided\u00a0by a lineup of local DJs in a concealed bar located within Tempuja Oji. To gain access, search for an odd-looking beer fridge and walk through the door.\n\u201cCreating a hidden bar allows us to break away from the norm,\u201d shares Dragg Wong, the co-founder of this two-in-one concept. \u201cIt\u2019s something meant to be discovered.\u201d And those adventurous enough are treated to nightly performances that range from house, soul, and funk \u2013 complemented with a selection of signature cocktails that include the Kaffir Sour ($20), made with ginger-infused whisky, kaffir lime leaves, and homemade ginger marmalade; and The Blind Pig ($24) served with Roku gin, beetroot marmalade, gula Melaka, and a slice of candied bacon.\n\u201cWe just want to see happy faces chatting away, enjoying the food, drinks, and experience,\u201d says Dragg. So while the combination of batter, booze, and beats in one location is an unusual one, the eclectic mix might just be the winning recipe.\nChinatown\nSituated at the back alley of Gemmill Lane, the entrance to Burger Bar \u2013 formerly called Burger Joint \u2013 is marked by a simple neon burger and a glass. The entrance itself is shielded by velvet curtains and a dark passageway. Burger Bar's signature hamburger ($17.10) and cheeseburger ($17.80) prove juicy and filling, but if you have room for more,\u00a0pick up the milkshakes ($11.80) or a pint of craft beer to complete your all-American burger experience.\nTanjong Pagar\nThis cosy restaurant off Amoy Street gives a hip, underground vibe with its hidden entrance (you have to enter via the side alley), exposed brick walls and tiny square windows. A popular hangout for both the lunch and dinner crowd, The Flying Squirrel offers Japanese-inspired cuisine ranging from sashimi ($49/platter of 16), handmade sushi ($42/platter of ten) and lunch bento sets ($19-$30) to the less conventional truffled ebi fry ($15), uni shooters ($22) served with sake and yuzu ponzu, as well as a wagyu burger p\u00e2t\u00e9 ($38).\nTanjong Pagar\nTo find Kabuke, you have to climb up a narrow flight of stairs along Telok Ayer street. The Japanese gastrobar occupies the second floor of an intimate shophouse space, with\u00a0a great dinner menu \u2013 bar bites, skewers and rice bowls are available alongside premium sake selections. Guests can design their own sake flight ($24) \u2013 which consists of a selection of three sake pours to your choosing \u2013 a great way to sample different types of sake, whether you\u2019re an experienced drinker or just starting out.\nTanglin\nThose who frequent Serene Centre will be familiar with popular dessert spot Sugarhaus. However, few will know that hidden within its premises is a cosy, open-grill steakhouse that focuses on lesser-known cuts of beef. At Fat Belly, you can forget about sirloins or rib-eyes. Instead, off-cuts like the Angus flat iron steak ($22) (a cut of beef from the cow\u2019s shoulder) and the Mayura\u00a0Signature\u00a0Wagyu Tri-tip ($55) are available. The latter comes from the famed Mayura station cow, which is fed chocolate to enhance the taste of the meat.\u00a0Sides like saut\u00e9ed thyme mushrooms ($8) or its creamed kale dish ($8) are also available.\nKallang\nYorimichi Yakitori isn't so much hidden as it is difficult to find, especially given its location at Golden Mile Tower, where mookata restaurants thrive. The izakaya's interior is covered floor-to-ceiling with Japanese posters, flyers, and\u00a0various paraphernalia. Wisterias hang from the ceiling trellis, an homage to Japan's native flora, but it's the food that truly reminds one of the Land of the Rising Sun. Yakitori here start from $5 per skewer for items like the torikawa (chicken skin) to $9.80 for lamb and kimchi pork.\nUp on the 19th floor of Oxley Tower in the heart of Tanjong Pagar lies Myo Restobar. It can be a bit of a pain to get to \u2013 take the wrong elevator and you end up in a carpark \u2013 but the trouble is definitely worth it. It's the sister restaurant of old-school Chinese restaurant Kia Hiang at International Plaza and serves homey Cantonese dishes like the Myo claypot organic chicken ($33) and dim sum dishes ($4.20-$8) that are sure to hit the spot. Here's how to get there: take the lift from lobby 1, hit the button for level 19 and push through the white door once you've made your way to the top.\nRestaurants, Contemporary Global\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "by Navin Pillay\nFOOD | 02 February 2019\nThese Japanese restaurants in Singapore serve up cheap, good and authentic sushi, ramen and izakaya and more.\nOne of the many perks of living in Singapore is access to great international food options, such as Japanese cuisine. We\u2019re home to a plethora of award-winning Japanese restaurants run by highly-skilled chefs. Some come with a hefty price tag \u2014 they boast recipes passed on from one generation to the next and the use of premium and hard-to-find ingredients. Thankfully, there are also affordable Japanese restaurants in town that don\u2019t compromise on ingredients or flavour. So, in lieu of Japan\u2019s National Foundation Day on February 11, we\u2019ve rounded up 10 Japanese restaurants in Singapore that serve delectable Japanese fare at wallet-friendly prices \u2014 that means $15 or less per pax. Itadakimasu!\nNestled inside Sunshine Plaza is a quaint little restaurant offering budget-friendly and tasty Japanese cuisine. District Sushi\u2019s most popular dish is Bara Chirashi Don ($13) comprising a liberal amount of octopus, tuna, salmon, prawn and ikura (salmon roe). Another notable dish is their Tamago Mentaiyaki Sushi ($6) which is served with torched mentaiko sauce (a creamy sauce of pollock roe and mayonnaise) atop a fluffy egg that adds flavour without detracting from the other ingredients. Furthermore, they have a great variety of sashimi, nigiri sushi and \u00e0 la carte sides that are below $15. Bonus? There\u2019s no GST or service charge.\nWhere: #01-15, Sunshine Plaza, 91 Bencoolen Street\nFor more info: Visit www.facebook.com/districtsushi\nShirokane Tori-Tama\nApr 7, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT\nYakitori restaurant Shirokane Tori-Tama was featured on Michelin Guide\u2019s Bib Gourmand list in 2017 \u2014 and with good reason. With more than 20 types of skewered chicken bits to choose from, there\u2019s definitely something for every palate. Try their Chochin ($6.50), which are underdeveloped eggs attached to the fallopian tube of the chicken. Sounds like something for the adventurous, but if you\u2019re going for it, pop the whole bit into your mouth and bite down. The result? An explosion of warm gooey yolk and succulent chicken meat\u2014definitely a must-try. For those with an appreciation for offal, have your pick of their skewered organs, such as chicken heart, windpipe, liver, spleen and more, all priced at $3.50 per stick. And for those looking for something more wholesome, try their Toritama Don ($13) which is served with liberal amounts of minced meat, grilled chicken and a poached egg atop a glorious bed of rice. Definitely worth visiting with friends .\nWhere: #01-02 Robertson Walk, 11 Unity Street\nFor more info: Call 6386-5680\nThe Public Izakaya\nDec 17, 2018 at 7:11pm PST\nAn Izakaya can be described as an informal Japanese pub for after-work drinking and casual dining. Although alcoholic beverages are their mainstay, Izakayas often pair their drinks with pretty awesome bar grub at affordable prices. The Public Izakaya is one such option \u2014 it serves some delicious skewers and Japanese light bites that have been a hit among many office workers. Try their Tori Karaage ($12), where chicken pieces are marinated in soya sauce and deep fried to perfection. With a crispy exterior housing soft and juicy flesh within, this is one of our faves. Squeeze the lemon wedge provided for an additional zesty tang.\nWhere: #01-09, 100AM Shopping Mall, 100 Tras Street and\u00a0#01-14/15/16, Altez, 16 Enggor Street\nFor more info: Visit or call 6604-9622 (100AM Shopping Mall) or6333-9622 (Altez)\nJan 20, 2017 at 10:22pm PST\nFounded by Singaporeans Melvin Ang and Brendon Leung, Kanshoku Ramen Bar offers really good Japanese ramen bowls at seriously affordable prices. Their Signature Kanshoku Ramen ($13.90) comes highly recommended by both staff and patrons. The dish boasts a creamy and medium bodied broth with its ramen cooked just right\u2014not too chewy or soft. If you love Japanese side dishes, try their Gyoza ($6) comprising pork and vegetables and is served slightly charred, giving it a crisp texture.\nWhere: Several outlets, including #01-06, Orchard Gateway, 227 Orchard Road\nFor more info: Visit www.kanshokuramen.com or call 6384-4770\nTamoya Udon\nApr 4, 2018 at 12:08am PDT\nTamoya Udon was founded in Kanagawa Prefecture in 1996 and gained popularity after clinching the title of \u201cBest Udon Maker of Kagawa Prefecture\u201d on a Japanese television show. Here, you\u2019ll find an assortment of udon dishes that are not only delicious, but affordable too \u2013 all udon dishes are $12.80 and below. One of the unique selling point of Tamoya is that its udon dishes are made to order with fresh ingredients imported from Japan. The Ooh-mami Udon ($10.80) is a crowd favourite comprising handmade udon bathed in a rich XO sauce and shrimp oil, and is served with Kake soup (a mildly flavoured broth). Other notable dishes include their Beef Sanuki Egg Udon ($11.20), comprising 100g of beef and sanuki udon, and topped off with an onsen egg. They also have an array of delectable tempura sides ($0.80 onward).\nWhere: #01-32 Liang Court, 177 River Valley Road\nFor more info: Visit www.tamoya.com.sg or call 6337-0301. Opens daily from 11am to 9.30pm\nKanpai Izakaya and Bar\nFeb 28, 2018 at 4:04am PST\nNestled within the Lorong Mambong stretch of shophouses at Holland Village, Kanpai Izakaya is popular for its lunch menu and happy hour promotions. They offer a good variety of popular Japanese dishes from various sushi to Kushiyaki (grilled skewers, $4.50 onwards) to Donburi (rice bowls, $14 onwards), ensuring there\u2019s something for someone at every budget. Go during lunch from 12 to 2pm and enjoy 30 off \u00e0 la carte items. Good deal!\nWhere: 40 Lorong Mambong\nFor more info: Visit www.kanpai.com.sg or call 6314-2368. Openings daily for lunch from 12pm to 2pm and dinner from 5pm to 12am\nView this post on Instagram\nOct 27, 2017 at 12:11am PDT\nHead over to The Sushi Bar for some mouthwatering sushi made with fresh ingredients. Try their made-to-order Soft Shell Crab Roll ($9.90) or their California Maki ($9.90). Both are satisfyingly good and hit the spot. Or take your pick from their selection of sashimi \u2014 The Sushi Bar serves generous and firm chunks that melt in your mouth. If you\u2019re in the mood for something heartier, try their Chicken Katsu Curry with rice ($13.90) that comes with a crispy and succulent chicken katsu (fried chicken cutlet) atop a fluffy bed of rice and topped with a generous scoop of curry.\nWhere: Several outlets including #04-28, Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road\nFor more info: Visit www.thesushibar.com.sg or call 9653 6464 (SMS reservation only)\nTanuki Raw\nDec 9, 2018 at 2:43am PST\nNo list of affordable Japanese restaurants in Singapore would be complete without mentioning Tanuki Raw . Its outlet at Kapok in National Design Centre is a popular dining spot amongst students from nearby schools. We recommend heading there for lunch, when prices on their most popular dishes are at its lowest. Our favourite? The Spicy Miso Char Siew Donburi ($13), served with sliced flame-seared spicy miso char siew over Tanuki Raw\u2019s mixed rice with saut\u00e9ed mushroom and onions and topped off with a wobbly onsen egg. Another notable dish is their Garlic Butter Chicken Donburi ($12.80). It\u2019s served with pan-fried chicken cutlet atop Tanuki Raw\u2019s signature rice, with mixed mushrooms, onsen egg and a generous amount of garlic brown butter teriyaki sauce. So good, you\u2019ll go into a food coma. Enjoy their selection of Donburi for only $10 from Monday to Thursday till 3pm.\nWhere: #01-05, National Design Centre, 111 Middle Road and\u00a0#04-01, Orchard Central, 181 Orchard Road\nFor more info: Visit www.tanukiraw.com or call 9035-9398 (National Design Centre) or 6636-5949 (Orchard Central)\nCafe & Meal Muji\nMay 30, 2017 at 9:08pm PDT\nIntimate and quiet, Cafe & Meal Muji is a great place to dine on healthy and wholesome meals that are pretty and flavourful. We recommend trying their Three-Deli Set ($14.90) where you get to choose two cold deli dishes and one hot deli dish (availability of options vary, so check out the outlet for dishes of the day) paired with a bowl of 16 Grain Rice or White Rice. You can add a bowl of Miso Soup or Cumin Carrot Soup. Another great option is their Chicken Nanban Donburi ($14.90) available only at their Raffles City outlet. The dish consists of 16 Grain Rice with Chicken Nanban, served in tartar sauce and topped with avocado, mesclun salad, fresh cherry tomatoes and daikon (winter radish) sprouts. It\u2019s a waist-friendly and wallet-friendly way to enjoy fuss-free Japanese cuisine.\nSushi Airways\nJun 6, 2018 at 7:18am PDT\nQuietly tucked away in Baghdad street is Sushi Airways \u2013 a quaint aeroplane-themed Japanese restaurant with great value-for-money lunch sets. Their Salmon Teriyaki Set ($14) features a prototypical bowl of Japanese white rice and salmon dressed in teriyaki sauce\u2014but don\u2019t be fooled but its simplicity, the flavours are spot on and complement one another perfectly. Another notable dish is their Wagyu Beef Yakiniku Set ($15) consisting of grilled beef, onion, carrot, mushroom, generous dollops of yakiniku sauce and served with fluffy Japanese white rice. What\u2019s great is the set includes a fragrant and delicious soup without added cost.\nWhere: 20A Baghdad Street\nWant More?\nGet the latest health & fitness news, tips and tricks direct to your inbox!\nBy signing up, you indicate that you have read and agreed to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nEVENTS & PROMOTIONS\nLIFESTYLE | 23 April 2020\nLicensed from Meredith Corp., Shape Singapore was launched in 2004.\nIt is the complete mind and body guide for women, with 12 editions worldwide and a readership of 52,000 in Singapore alone.\nSubscribe now to receive the latest news and promotions from Shape Singapore and our partners!\nBy signing up, you indicate that you have read and agreed to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 SPH MAGAZINES PTE LTD CO.

            "17 AFFORDABLE Dim Sum in Singapore- The ONLY Guide You Need\nLast updated on July 17th, 2019,\n1. TIM HO WAN\nFirst up, Tim Ho Wan ! I still remember having to queue for at least an hour when it first came to Singapore. I\u2019m sure you are familiar with its classic Baked BBQ Pork Bun. Most of its steamed and fried dim sums are above average. I actually wished that Tim Ho Wan will bring back its fried prawn dumplings though. I wonder why they were discontinued because it was one of the better ones around.\nTim Ho Wan\nAddress: 68 Orchard Rd, Plaza Singapura, #01-29A & #01-52, Singapore 238839\nPhone: 6251 2000\nOpening Hours: Weekdays: 10am to 10pm. Weekends: 9am to 10pm.\n2. SWEE CHOON TIM SUM RESTAURANT\nSwee Choon is very popular with supper-goers. Some think its the best dim sum place ever, but others think that it is pricey and that there\u2019s better dim sum out there. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best, it\u2019s definitely a place I\u2019ll go to if I\u2019m craving for dim sum after 10pm. Swee Choon also has unique dishes that can\u2019t be found in most dim sum eateries. Examples include Spicy & Sour Soup La Mian, Smoked Duck Breast w/Black Pepper,\u00a0Prawn & Banana Fritter and\u00a0Drunken Chicken in Shao Xing Wine.\nSwee Choon Tim Sum Restaurant\nAddress: 183-191 Jalan Besar, Singapore 208882\nPhone: 6225 7788\nOpening Hours: 11am to 2:30pm, 6pm to 6am daily. 10am to 2:30pm, 6pm to 6am on Sundays and Public Holidays. Closed on Tuesdays.\n3. 126 DIM SUM WEN DAO SHI \u63fe\u5230\u98df\nMany know 126 as a supper spot. But if you can make it, go during dinner time to try its \u201cdinner-only\u201d menu. The White Pepper Crab Bee Hoon is one of the must-tries! I love the fried items, as well as porridge! The Geylang outlet used to serve porridge in an individual claypot, so it was super shiok to have my favourite duck porridge still bubbling throughout my meal. Ever since 126 opened a second outlet in Boon Keng, I started patronising the Boon Keng outlet because it is less crowded (just that it is not open for 24 hours). 126 has really interesting and funny names for some of its dishes, like \u7f51\u7403 which translates to \u201cTennis\u201d in English, but it actually is fried meat nuggets. All in all, 126 is my favourite go-to dim sum place for fried dim sums. I highly recommend the Fried Scallop Roll and Fried Beancurd Roll.\n126 Dim Sum Wen Dao Shi \u63fe\u5230\u98df\nAddress: 126 Sims Avenue, Singapore 387449\nPhone: 6746 4757\n4. VICTOR\u2019S KITCHEN\nThe fluffy Flowing Custard Buns have a core of buttery sugary custard which is armed with a strong hint of salted egg yolk. I also like the H.K. Summer Ice Tea as it\u2019s served the way milk tea is usually served in Hong Kong \u2014 chilled in an ice bath so that the drink is kept undiluted. Victor\u2019s Kitchen will score higher points if the quality of its steamed dim sums were more consistent.\nMobile: 9838 2851\n5. YI DIAN XIN HONG KONG DIM SUM\nYi Dian Xin does most of its dim sums really well, despite it\u2019s relatively low price. Just look at the Crystal Chives Dumplings. Crystal chives dumplings are not available in most dim sum places because of how difficult it is to make. But here at Yi Dian Xin, the almost-transparent skin was thick, yet soft and delicate, at the same time. You can\u2019t deny that this masterpiece requires an expert to craft! Other items that I will recommend are Steamed BBQ Pork Pau, Signature Salted Egg Custard Pau, and Steamed Carrot Cake.\nYi Dian Xin Hong Kong Dim Sum\nAddress: 1012 Upper Serangoon Road, Teo Seng Eating House, Singapore 534750\nMobile: 9168 5587\nEmail Address: yidianxin@yahoo.com\n6. DIM SUM HAUS\nDim Sum Haus is an air-conditioned eatery that offers each dim sum at less than $5. In addition, their menu is extensive! Must-tries include Steamed Shrimp Dumpling \u201cHar Gao\u201d and \u00a0Steamed Charcoal Chicken & Shrimp Dumpling!\nA die-die-must-try is the Steamed Crispy Rice Roll with Shrimp! The huge shrimps are first fried before being wrapped in thin rice rolls! The contrast between the smooth rice rolls and crispy prawns made this dish the star of Dim Sum Haus ! As for HK-style roast meats, go for the char siew!\nDim Sum Has\nPhone: 6909 0777\nOpening Hours: Weekdays: 11:30am to 3pm, 5:30pm to 10:30pm. Weekends: 10:30am to 10:30pm. Closed on Mondays.\n7. KUAI SAN DIAN XIN\nLocated at Lakeside, most people will mistake this as the 2nd branch of the 24/7 \u201cKuai San Dian Xin\u201d at Woodlands. It isn\u2019t but it doesn\u2019t really matter to me because everything is $1.30 here! The staff will heat up the steamed dishes upon order while the fried dim sums are kept crispy and warm. You can have AS MUCH dim sum as you want here at Kuai San Dian Xin and you won\u2019t burn a hole in your pocket!\nKuai San Dian Xin\nOpening Hours: 6am to 10pm daily.\n8. LAI KEE DIM SUM\nLai Kee has multiple stalls in Singapore, but its dim sum is not fantastic. However, if you\u2019re looking for unique and special dim sum that can\u2019t be found elsewhere, Lai Kee is the place to go! An example is the \u201cJi Guo\u201d Pau which resembled a traditional Lor Mai Kai encased in a Pau. It even has an unagi sushi-like dim sum which is cool!\nLai Kee Dim Sum\nOpening Hours: 6:30am to 9:30pm daily.\n9. SHI WEI XIAN HONG KONG DIM SUM\nHave you heard of any dim sum place that operates only on weekends? Shi Wei Xian Hong Kong Dim Sum does just that! They make it seem like they are busy hand-making all the dim sums on weekdays so that they can cater to the huge demand every Saturday and Sunday. One thing you MUST order from Shi Wei Xian is the Fried Yam Puff and Ham Sui Gok (Fried glutinous rice dumpling with pork and shrimp filling). Both are really good and better than the ones from some restaurants even. Sometimes, they have \u201cspecial dim sums\u201d of the week such as Quail Egg Dumpling and Spinach Siew Mai, so remember to ask them about it when you\u2019re there!\nAddress: 119 Aljunied Ave 2, #01-06, Singapore 380119\nMobile: 8111 4950, 8322 6923\nOpening Hours: 7am to 5pm on Weekends only.\n10. MONGKOK DIM SUM\nMongkok Dim Sum has 3 outlets, but only the Geylang outlet is open 24/7. Its Pan-fried Carrot Cake is to die for! The fragrant carrot cake was lightly charred, and held a slight crisp, while the white radish within was perfectly soft! Consider its appetisers (Cucumber Salad with Century Egg) and Tze char dishes (Kong Pao Frogs) too! They have a really wide selection so you can have Mongkok Dim Sum any time of the day!\nMongkok Dim Sum\nMobile: 9191 8829\nEmail Address: info@mongkokdimsum.sg\n11. HONG KONG MONG KOK TIM SUM\nWith only 6 items ($2.30 each) on its menu, Hong Kong Mong Kok Tim Sum must be doing something right to have been around for 16 years. Passionate about dim sum, Mr Chi Shu Kei makes all of the items in his humble stall by hand. Go for the Har Gau (usually sold out the fastest) and fluffy Char Siew Pao!\nHong Kong Mong Kok Tim Sum\nAddress: 335 Smith St, #02-097, Singapore 050335\nMobile: 9735 6312\nOpening Hours: 11am to 5pm daily. Closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.\n12. KOWLOON HONG KONG DIM SUM\nKow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum serves more than 50 different handmade Hong Kong and Shanghai Dim Sum. It takes up 2 stall units in the coffeeshop of Blk 151 Ang Mo Kio Ave 5. One stall handles orders and cashiering, while the other stall functions as the kitchen. Usually, Beancurd Skin Roll is either deep-fried or steamed, but here, it is deep-fried, and then steamed! It\u2019s definitely worth a try. Also, don\u2019t belittle the Century Egg and Pork Congee which is flavoursome.\nKow Loon Hong Kong Dim Sum\nAddress: Blk 151, Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, #01-3030, Singapore 560151\nMobile: 9685 9371\nEmail Address: zhouxiong_kof@hotmail.com\n13. HO YUN (HONG KONG) TIM SUM\nHelmed by a Hong Konger, Ho Yun sends out humble dim sum which will bring you back to Hong Kong! Ho Yun offers dim sum rice bowls ($3.20 each), such as pork spare ribs with rice, in Hong Kong-style metal bowls. Fried items costs $0.90 each, and 4 pieces go for $3.50. One thing you must not miss is its flavourful Century Egg with Lean Pork Porridge. It was thick and had the right gooeyness. The crispy crackers made the whole dish even more irresistible! The Pork Spare Ribs in black bean sauce was above average too!\nHo Yun (Hong Kong) Tim Sum\nAddress: 419 Tampines Street 41, #01-80, Singapore 520419\nOpening Hours: 07:30am to 07:30pm daily.\n14. LEGENDARY HONG KONG\nThe menu has over 300 dishes and the kitchen is helmed by five accomplished Master Chefs, each with their own specialty in Hong Kong cuisine that spans across five themes \u2013 Roasted Meats, Noodles and Congee, Dim Sum and Bakery. A hot-seller is the Baked BBQ Pork Buns which are usually the first to be sold out! Sauteed Turnip Cake with XO Sauce is also worth a try. The Legendary Hong Kong house specialty of \u201cRoasted London Duck\u201d (\u660e\u7089\u70e7\u4f26\u6566\u9e2d) is undisputedly the best-seller amongst the roasted meats, For stir-fried dishes, go for the Braised Beef Brisket, Tendon & Tripe and Braised Assorted Vegetables with Preserved Taro Sauce in Clay Pot! Those two are legendary!\nLegendary Hong Kong\nAddress: 63 Jurong West Central 3, #03-80 Jurong Point 2 Shopping Centre, Singapore 648331\nPhone: 6794 1335\nOpening Hours: Weekdays: 11am to 10pm. Weekends and Public Holidays: 10am to 10pm\n15. EAST BISTRO\nChef Tony Wong, who has over 2 decades of experience as the former head chef of Lei Garden Singapore, specialises in Hong Kong Tim Sum and Cantonese Dishes. The Chef\u2019s Speciality \u201cPao Fan\u201d was truly one-of-a-kind \u2014 also the dish which drove East Bistro to fame.\nThe \u201cmushroom\u201d char siew bao which looked like two oversized Shitake mushrooms were extremely soft and fluffy, unlike any other char siew bao you might find in Singapore. To cater to local tastebuds, they have classic tze char dishes such as Har Cheong Gai, Cereal Prawn and Red Garoupa Steamboat. Last but not least, I have to mention that I\u2019m impressed by the warm hospitality provided!\nEast Bistro\nPhone: 67524844\nWebsite: http://eastbistro.sg\nOpening Hours: Weekdays: 11am to 3pm, 5pm to 10pm. Closed on Tuesdays. Weekends: 9am to 3pm, 5:30pm to 10pm.\n16. XIAO CHEN HANDMADE BAO DIAN\nMost dim sum stalls that are situated in coffee shops serve items that is mass-produced in factories. But not Xiao Chen Handmade Bao Dian in Geylang Bahru. The stall has its items all handmade from scratch by a Malaysian cook daily. Most of the items are priced at $1.90 even though the boss uses only fresh meat (no frozen meat please) to make his dim sum.\nXiao Chen Handmade Bao Dian\nAddress: 68 Geylang Bahru, Singapore 330068\nOpening Hours: 7am to 8pm, closed on alternate Wednesdays\n17. JOHORE YE ZHI MEI HANDMADE DIM SUM\nDuring the 1990s, Johore Ye Zhi Mei Handmade Dim Sum rose to fame in Malaysia because of its jumbo-size pau. As huge as a soup bowl, the pau is filled with pork, chicken, hard-boiled egg, mushrooms and Chinese sausage. Slightly on the sweeter side, it is juicy and the skin is so soft even though the weight of this pau is 500g! Johore Ye Zhi Mei Handmade Dim Sum offers glutinous rice with chicken, steamed rice rolls and many other items too!\nJohore Ye Zhi Mei Handmade Bao\nAddress: 208 Jln Besar, Singapore 208894\nPhone: 6294 2210\nOpening Hours: 24 hours. Closed on Mondays.\nGosh, it\u2019s a long list, isn\u2019t it? If you think I\u2019ve missed out any stall that deserves a spot in this guide, let me know! Now that I\u2019m done writing this list, I have the urge to return to some of these places to indulge in a dim sum feast!\nMissTamChiak.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the stalls featured here.\nFor more food videos, check out and subscribe to our official YouTube channel !\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nFind Near MRT Stations\n"

            "Instagram/thechoyalicious\nPsst! AsiaOne is on Telegram! Tell your friends! https://t.me/asiaonecom\nSushi aficionados would already know this, but\u00a0Sushiro \u2014 Japan\u2019s largest conveyor belt sushi chain \u2014 has finally hit Singapore (19 Aug 2019)! The chain has 530 outlets around the world, but the local one at Tiong Bahru Plaza is their first in Southeast Asia.\nSushiro is known for being delicious and ridiculously affordable in Japan, where prices start at just \u00a5100 before tax, which is about S$1.30. How does the Singapore Sushiro compare? Is it as cheap? Will it put Sushi Express out of business?\nLet\u2019s compare them to find out. Heck, we\u2019ll even throw in Sakae Sushi, Nihon Mura and Genki Sushi into the mix to find the most value-for-money sushi restaurant in Singapore.\nCHEAP CONVEYOR BELT SUSHI RESTAURANTS IN SINGAPORE\nOf course, all Japanese restaurants serve sushi and sashimi, but for this, we are focusing on affordable, casual dining at conveyor belt sushi chains.\nConveyor belt sushi restaurant\n$2.39 to $6.39\nAll prices stated above exclude GST and service charge, which means prices start at about $2 to $3 per plate after taxes.\nCheapest sushi \u2014 Sushi Express, everything at $1.50++\nOne-price sushi \u2014 Sushi Express ($1.50++), Nihon Mura Express ($1.80++)\nMost value-for-money\u00a0sushi \u2014 Sushiro ($2.20++ to $4.80++), only uses Japan-imported fish and other ingredients\nSUSHIRO (NEWLY OPENED!)- IMPORTED, JAPAN-QUALITY SUSHI FROM $2.20++\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1TnBH-JUua/[/embed]\nAt Sushiro Singapore, prices start at $2.20++, which a little more than \u00a5100, but still competitive considering the quality of the food \u2014 the ingredients (like the sashimi!) are all imported from Japan. There are over 100 varieties of sushi, most of which fall in the $2.20++ to $3.20++ range.\nI\u2019ve tried it, and I am super impressed. I especially loved the Otoro fatty tuna sushi which is just $2.20++ during the opening promotion (UP $4.80++). It was sweet and creamy, and the fish-to-rice ratio was great. They are generous with the fish \u2014 the thick slices are like the kind that\u2019s usually served on platters.\nAnother noteworthy item is the chawanmushi, which is only $3.50++, but has sweet prawns and a big scallop in it.\nThe menu is the most comprehensive of the 3 above, even featuring ramen (from $5.50++), ice-cream desserts (from $6.50++) and alcohol like beer ($11.50++), sake (from $37++/bottle), and a whiskey-soda beverage ($10++). They also have some interesting fusion dishes like roast beef sushi ($4.80++) and dong po pork sushi ($2.20++).\nThere are 2 conveyor belts: one for everyone to use, and one that directs items (that you order on the tablet) to your table. Kind of like how a train pulls into a station \u2014 it\u2019s quite fun!\nThere\u2019s an added bit of technology to up the game even more: each plate (travelling on the belt) comes with an IC chip embedded. The chip tracks the plates\u2019 journey on the belt, ensuring it doesn\u2019t go round the belt for more than 350m.\nMIND.BLOWN.\nI have close to no concept of distance, but judging from the 3 rows of seats the belt covers, it looks to be about 1 full round around the restaurant.\nSUSHI EXPRESS- $1.50++ FOR EVERYTHING, CHEAPEST SUSHI CHAIN IN SINGAPORE\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1O9y6LHNEg/[/embed]\nWith everything at $1.50++ per plate, Sushi Express is the cheapest conveyor belt sushi chain in Singapore. It\u2019s literally the Daiso of the F&B world.\nThe menu mostly consists of sushi, sashimi, sides (more like appetisers) and desserts. There are crowd favourites like salmon sashimi, salmon aburi sushi, and more, but they don\u2019t have things like rice bowls and noodles. They also don\u2019t offer chawanmushi (steamed egg), which was disappointing.\nOccasionally, they have seasonal dishes. When I went, they had a mini salmon rice bowl. It was considered 2 plates, making it $3++.\nThere\u2019s only 1 conveyor belt for everyone and you can\u2019t order your dishes, where you sit at Sushi Express is kind of important. If you want something that\u2019s not on the belt, you\u2019ll have to tell the waiter and they\u2019ll tell the kitchen, who will then put it out. So if you sit far away from the kitchen, it may not reach you.\n(Don\u2019t laugh, it always happens to me!)\nQuality-wise, I personally find Sushi Express a little lacking. I\u2019m no food connoisseur, but even I can tell that their dishes are not as tasty as others. It\u2019s fast-food sushi, and you can really tell. However, all in all,\u00a0considering the cheap price tag, it\u2019s not half bad. I actually dine there pretty often.\nIf you have an army-boy appetite and could polish off 15 plates in one seating, then this is a great option. Anywhere else, you\u2019d spend a bomb.\nNIHON MURA EXPRESS- $1.80++ FOR EVERYTHING\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvop6QtBK0c/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]\nNihon Mura Express has the same concept as Sushi Express, but is $0.30++ more expensive per plate at $1.80++.\nThe selection is slightly better than Sushi Express: aside from the usual suspects, there are dishes like fried chicken (tori karaage namban), salmon cheek (salmon kama karaage) and more.\nIf you don\u2019t want to pick plates off the conveyor belt, there\u2019s a small tablet on each table for you to order what you want. Those ordered will be served to your table, which, although defeats the purpose of the conveyor belt, is much more effective at getting your dishes to you quickly.\nNihon Mura Express is best known for their birthday promotion: for every year of age you are, you get to order a plate for $1++. That means that if you\u2019re 30, you can have 30 X $1++ plates. It\u2019s only valid at the Kallang Leisure Park and Rivervale Mall outlets though.\nGENKI SUSHI- AFFORDABLE SUSHI, SASHIMI & MORE FROM $1.80++ TO $5.80++\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BzFqDQujNO5/[/embed]\nGenki Sushi\u2019s conveyor belt system is called the \u201cKousoku Express\u201d, and like Sushiro\u2019s, it delivers your orders to your table, so every order is freshly prepared.\nThe sushi dishes are quite competitively priced, with most items under $3. They also have quite a good selection \u2014 if you\u2019re a fan of mentaiko (pollock roe), they have seared mentaiko salmon, crab stick and shrimp for just $2.80++, which is very affordable.\nHowever, I find the sashimi a tad expensive. The salmon, tuna and swordfish sashimi are $5.80++ for a plate of 4 slices. The more premium cuts (like salmon belly and yellowtail) are $7.80++.\nThat\u2019s comparable to full-fledge Japanese restaurants like Sushi Tei and the likes.\nSAKAE SUSHI- PRICES FROM $2.39++\nWhat is a sushi listicle without Sakae Sushi , right? Sakae Sushi is one of the longest-running Japanese restaurants in Singapore!\nI\u2019ve not been to Sakae Sushi in a while \u2014 it really is more of a student hang-out spot \u2014 but based on a quick survey in the office, it\u2019s still just \u201cmeh\u201d. The sushi isn\u2019t fantastic, and it isn\u2019t the cheapest. Prices start at $2.39++ for most sushis.\u00a0The salmon sashimi is $6.39++ for 4 slices.\nSakae Sushi used be popular for being one of the more affordable options, but since Sushi Express\u2019 entrance into the game, it\u2019s fast phasing out (in my opinion anyway).\nIt\u2019s a full Japanese restaurant though, so they\u2019re still relatively cheap for dishes like rice bowls, noodles and other mains. Many people go to Sakae Sushi for their delivery platters too. They feed 2 to 3 pax, and cost $66 to $77 (about $20+ per pax).\nWhich is your favourite sushi chain?

            "It is that time of the year again; with the festive season just around the corner, we are undoubtedly reminded of decadent holiday treats and majestic wintertime roasts. Although many associate the holidays with the typical Western spread, not every meal needs to be an elaborate and extravagant affair of turkey, ham, and a copious amount of cranberry sauce. This festive season, why not treat your family to a casual yet delightful Japanese repast at Ichiban Sushi?\nMore than just a convenient option, Ichiban Sushi is a welcoming space perfect for families to spend some quality time together over the holidays. Instead of needing to splurge on lavish meals to be able to enjoy Japanese cuisine, the brand prides itself in offering an accessible alternative without skimping on standards.\nOffering four value-for-money set meals, expect to indulge in a sumptuous meal that will leave you hankering for more.

As there is no hot soup involved, it is no wonder this dish is particularly popular during the hot summer months in Japan and Korea.\nWith several outlets in South Korea and Japan, Kanda Soba\u00a0has finally arrived on our local shores, rolling out their famed mazesoba bowls, sushi platters and HULK Power drinks! Ramen lovers be warned: this restaurant will overthrow your love for ramen and turn you into a mazesoba convert.\nKanda Soba is now offering a set lunch promotion at affordable prices! For only S$12, you get to have their Original Mazesoba, two pieces of yummy sushi, and a beef soup. So, make a beeline for their eatery and see what the hype about them back in South Korea and Japan is all about!\nA celebrated stalwart in Singapore\u2019s omakase scene, Sushi Jiro is an institution that aims to provide diners with a lavish, authentic dining experience that comes as close to the ones you can get in Japan itself.\nFor a multi-sensory journey that aims to let your taste buds feel things that they\u2019ve never felt before, Sushi Jiro employs only the most premium ingredients to create their gastronomical masterpieces.\u00a0From incredibly fresh seasonal seafood to the best cuts of beef that are air-flown from Japan up to 4-times a week, you can be assured that you\u2019ll be getting the best out of the best when you dine here at Sushi Jiro.\nBoasting a spacious floor space that can accommodate over 100 diners, the restaurant\u2019s palatially designed interior mimics that of a traditional Japanese sushi eatery and\u00a0provides a cosy dining environment for you to enjoy your meal. Also accompanying the welcoming interior is the breathtaking view of Keppel Bay with its sleek architecture and orderly lined-up rows of yachts.\nFrom now until 30 August 2019, our readers can quote \u2018ladyironchef\u2019 upon making reservations to enjoy 15% OFF Sushi Jiro\u2019s omakase menus. The promotion may not be combined with other discounts, promotions, and vouchers.

They offer a wide range of Japanese cuisine at fairly affordable price points.\nFrom hearty ramen to fresh sashimi air-flown directly from Tokyo\u2019s Tsukiji Fish Market twice a week, this is one Japanese restaurant in the heart of Orchard Road to love if you don\u2019t already know.\nYou\u2019d be glad to hear that Tsukiji Fish Market is set to enthral with brand new additions to their vast variety of Japanese fare that they have to offer. From 9th July 2018 until 31st August 2018, you can quote \u2018ladyironchef\u2018 to enjoy 20% off the total bill on the \u00e0 la carte menu*.\nHere is what you can expect on your next visit to Tsukiji Fish Market, in accordance to the concepts that they offer.\nThe concept of omakase revolves around allowing the sushi chef to decide on the choice of dishes to serve his or her customers and will typically consist of a series of plates, beginning with the lightest fare and subsequently proceeding on to the heavier dishes.\nThere\u2019s so much to love about this culinary style\u2014from the trust that diners give the chef to the chef\u2019s expertise in featuring a menu that encompasses only the freshest produce of the season. An omakase meal often starts off with an assortment of sushi, sashimi, cooked dishes and seasonal vegetables with common mainstays such as otoro (fatty tuna belly) and sometimes even premium ingredients with the likes of uni.\nWhat makes omakase intriguing is the fact that you never know what to expect. No one really knows what the chef might serve because the dishes vary according to the season. Make no mistake that meals such as these do not necessarily come cheap, but if you\u2019re hankering for a taste of Japanese omakase dining at its finest, here is our list of 10 best Japanese\u00a0restaurants for omakase in Singapore.\nIzakaya bars are all the rage now, especially among the office crowd and En Sakaba under the\u00a0Izakaya Japanese Dining Group (which manages\u00a0En Japanese Dining at Mohd Sultan, En Japanese Dining Bar at Bukit Timah and Z\u2019en Japanese Cuisine)\u00a0is not a name unheard of.\nNow with a total of 4 new outlets\u2014each boasting different concepts\u2014this izakaya slash Japanese restaurant group is a true haven for those in search of tantalising Japanese fare, a chic yet cosy spot to relax at and a solid tipple.\nIntroducing its new flagship restaurant and the group\u2019s fourth outlet, En Sakaba at Capital Tower is set to enthrall with their stellar shabu shabu offering, visually stunning \u00e0 la carte items as well as a selection of curated Japanese whiskies and sake for your after-work tippling pleasure.\nFor a limited period and exclusive only at Capital Tower, En Sakaba is having a hot pot buffet dinner that comes with a selection of appetisers, 3 kinds sashimi platter, wagyu sushi, prawn and vegetables tempura, H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream as well as a monumental shabu shabu that sees unlimited servings of Japan\u2019s No. 1 of Miyazaki wagyu beef,\u00a0premium zuwai\u00a0kani queen crab, ib\u00e9rico kurobuta pork, assorted vegetables, udon and Japanese porridge\u2014all at only S$78++ per pax (U.P. S$108++ per pax).\nWe kid you not, from the sweet flesh of the queen crab to the perfectly marbled, melt-in-your-mouth Miyazaki Wagyu, this is a shabu shabu feast that you must try and you\u2019d be a fool if you missed it.\nAn omakase course is a Japanese dining tradition where diners entrust their dining experience entirely to the chef who will showcase his culinary skills and creativity throughout the meal. To the Japanese, an omakase course is not to be taken lightly\u2014only chefs with many years of culinary experience are able to dazzle you with the season\u2019s best ingredients and exotic delicacies.\nSince omakase is serious business, those who are looking for an authentic experience that is similar to what you will find in Japan have to know about Sushi Jiro at Marina Mandarin Singapore.

And that the most sinful one is Brown Sugar Milk Tea with pearls \u2014 which according to its infographic which compared the sugar and calorie content of various bubble teas \u2014 contained a whopping 18.5 teaspoons of sugar per cup. Singaporeans\u2019 insatiable appetite for brown sugar pearl milk seem unabated, judging from the number of shops that offer the drink and the crowds that throng them.\nBubble tea has seen some ups and downs in Singapore. The takeaway bubble tea shop first appeared circa 2001 and then, pardon the pun, the bubble burst a few years later when there was a surplus of chain stores, mom-and-pops ones, even hawker stalls. But now, the trend is back with a vengeance, the latest craze centred around brown sugar pearl milk. The beverage \u2014 a blend of fresh milk, brown sugar syrup and pearls \u2014 was created in Taiwan, the birth place of bubble tea, where customers queue for up to a crazy three hours just to buy brown sugar milk from Taiwanese bubble tea chain Tiger Sugar . The brand launched its first outlet in Singapore at Capitol Piazza in 2018 to much fanfare and hour-long queues, and now boasts five other outlets. Shortly after, other bubble tea specialists such as The Alley and Xin Fu Tang have since set up shop in Singapore too. And suddenly, we see brown sugar pearl milk everywhere, even at older stores like Each a Cup.\nWhat\u2019s its appeal? As it\u2019s made from purely fresh milk with rich brown sugar boiled to a caramelised finish and no tea, this drink doesn\u2019t contain any caffeine. It\u2019s also very pretty \u2014 the brown sugar syrup trickles in to form trippy patterns in the milk. Drinking it is also a fun experience: some brands like Tiger Sugar recommend that you shake the drink precisely 15 times to blend its ingredients before sipping it, while others like Chinese bubble tea chain MuYoo encourages you to taste their warm pearls and cold milk individually to experience the contrast in flavours before mixing it all up. Brown sugar milk is also creamier and packs a higher sugar content than the average bubble tea, \u2019cos the brands offering the drink do not allow you to customise a lower sugar level, unlike your usual bubble tea order.\nConsidering that the Ministry of Health is considering a total ban or taxation on high-sugar drinks (Singapore has the highest prevalence of diabetes among developed nations), we wonder if the bubble tea craze here may eventually see a clamp down. But if you're planning to sparingly drink only one cup of brown sugar pearl milk in the interest of health, we've made the choice easier. We tasted 22 brands from all over Singapore that offer the beverage \u2014 and ranked them from meh to yum so you can make that one cup count.\nWithout further ado, here are the results, ranked from our least fave to favourite (scroll to the bottom for #1).\n1/22\n1/22\nBrown Sugar Milk, $4.70 (RANKED #22)\nKoi is usually our reliable go-to for a good cup of bubble tea, but oddly enough, they miss the mark when it comes to their version of this faddish drink. The brown sugar syrup had a disconcertingly artificial taste, and when mixed with the diluted milk, reminds us of\u2026 chendol with melted ice and gula melaka syrup\u00a0 coagulated into a soggy pool. The sugar overpowers the milk\u2019s natural clean, creamy taste, and we couldn't manage more than a few\u00a0sips. Instead of the usual black tapioca pearls, Koi uses golden pearls (tapioca mixed with golden brown sugar) that is firmer-textured than regular pearls. So if you\u2019re used to pearls with a softer bite, this will not be the brown sugar pearl milk for you.\n49 outlets including #B2-37C Ngee Ann City, 391 Orchard Rd, S238872. Tel: 6815-5488. Open daily 10am-10pm. www.facebook.com/koithesg\n2/22\n2/22\nBrown Sugar Pearls with Fresh Milk, $3.80 (RANKED #21)\nThis cute classroom-themed cafe specialises in Taiwanese food. Specifically, lu rou fan (braised pork rice) and Taiwanese-style mee sua. Incidentally, it also serves its version of brown sugar pearl milk made with Magnolia full cream milk. We find the drink rather bland; there is barely any whiff of brown sugar syrup and the tapioca pearls are overcooked. But perhaps that is because the drink was delivered to us. To be fair, the cafe doesn\u2019t specialise in selling bubble tea, so we can hardly expect the same kind of standard that we get from\u00a0specialised chains.\n#01-61, 462 Crawford Lane, S190462. Tel: 9154-8191. Open daily except Mon, 10am-9pm. www.facebook.com/eat3bowls\n3/22\n3/22\nBrown Sugar Bubble Milk, $4.40\u00a0(RANKED #20)\nThis new Taiwanese import at Yishun\u2019s Northpoint City mall mainly offers fruit vinegar tea, but it also has a number of milk-based picks, like this Brown Sugar Bubble Milk. The milk\u00a0tastes\u00a0watered down, and the flavour of brown sugar is too\u00a0mild. The\u00a0pearls in this\u00a0are also harder and more sugary\u00a0compared to the other bubble tea brands'.\n#B2-134 Northpoint City, 1 Northpoint Dr, S768019. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/TrueBoss.SG\n4/22\n4/22\nPearl Milk with Brown Sugar, $3.30\u00a0(RANKED #19)\nThe bubble tea brand from Taipei features pearls cooked with caramelised brown sugar, which perk up the otherwise unmemorable blah-tasting milk with a weak hint of brown sugar.\n#01-02A 51@Ang Mo Kio, 51 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, S5699922. Tel: 6747-6003. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/kungfuteasg .\n5/22\n5/22\nSharetea\nBrown Sugar Pearl Fresh Milk, $4.80\u00a0(RANKED #18)\nThis Taiwanese bubble tea chain is one of the earliest on the scene, having first opened in 1992 in its native country. Unsurprisingly, it also regularly offers all-the-rage drinks that are trending with Singaporeans. Too bad their Brown Sugar Pearl Fresh Milk is unmemorable, with blah-tasting milk, too-burnt brown sugar syrup and hard, unwieldy pearls.\nSeven outlets including #01-14A Bugis Junction, S188021. Tel: 6338-1737. www.facebook.com/pg/ShareteaSG .\n6/22\n6/22\nWinnie's\nBlack Sugar Fresh Milk, $5.50\u00a0(RANKED #17)\nAlso hailing from Taiwan, this rather obscure bubble tea brand opened its first outlet in October this year at Fusionopolis. Unlike the brown sugar that other bubble tea shops use, Winnie\u2019s adds Taiwanese black sugar in its milk drink. Black sugar, made by boiling cane sugar till it becomes a thick dark syrup, has a more intense flavour compared to brown sugar, which is why we could detect a\u00a0more intense, fragrant caramel note in this drink. The Meiji full cream milk used here comes with a dollop of bouncy house-made honey pearls, which are sadly too cloying for our liking.\nTwo outlets including #01-34 Galaxis,1 Fusionopolis Place, S138522. Tel: 8128-8802. Open daily except Sun. Mon-Fri 11am-8pm; Sat 11am-2.30pm. www.facebook.com/winnies.sg .\n7/22\n7/22\nKeCha\nAuthentic Taiwan Brown Sugar Milk, $5.30\u00a0(RANKED #16)\nThis relatively obscure bubble tea chain from Taiwan has three outlets in Singapore, and it\u2019s really more famous for its Instagrammable colourful drinks sold in slim screw cap bottles. They also offer a similar bottled version for their Brown Sugar Milk (top up an extra 60 cents) so you can save your drink for later if you can\u2019t finish it. You can also order it in the usual plastic cup, like we did. It was served to us with attractive gradient shades of white milk, inky brown sugar syrup and a dollop of dark brown sugar pearls. We mix our drink thoroughly and took a sip. It\u2019s really, really sweet \u2014 as though there was additional sugar syrup added on top of caramelised brown sugar syrup, though the brown sugar doesn't taste quite fragrant enough, and the milk not all that creamy. The accompanying brown sugar pearls were also undercooked and tough to chew on.\nThree outlets, including #01-16E Far East Plaza, S228213. Tel: 9152-1315. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/pg/kechasingapore .\n8/22\n8/22\nBrown Sugar Boba Milk, $4.50\u00a0(RANKED #15)\nOne of the oldest bubble tea chains in Singapore, Each a Cup is also hopping on the trend bandwagon, offering its own version of brown sugar pearl milk. Unlike the other bubble tea brands, where the brown sugar pearls fill at least a quarter of the cup, our freshly-prepared medium-sized drink comes with significantly less pearls. Pity, since the pearls here are pretty yummy: QQ and not too sweet. We\u2019re surprised, since this store\u2019s pearls have never been particularly outstanding to us. While the milk used for the drink is fresh and creamy, the brown sugar syrup is rather insipid.\n12 outlets including #B4-69 Ion Orchard. Tel: 9182-9307. Open daily 10am-10pm. www.each-a-cup.com .\n9/22\n9/22\nLiHo\nBrown Sugar Pearl Fresh Milk, $3.60\u00a0(RANKED #14)\nLocal bubble tea outfit LiHo follows the same recipe as its bubble tea counterparts for its brown sugar pearl milk. That is, fresh milk + brown sugar syrup + brown sugar pearls. We tried this freshly prepared, and it is not bad, from the caramel-spiked Farmhouse brand full cream milk to the al dente pearls. But it is also not mind-blowing. In case you forget they are the folks who first introduced cheese foam tea in Singapore, they also have a Salted Egg Lava version of the brown sugar pearl fresh milk, as well as an Avocado one. We gamely tried the salted egg drink. While the savoury salted egg yolk has a to-die-for sandy, viscous texture, it really has no business being in a milky drink. Back to custard buns you go, salted egg lava. Meanwhile, the avocado flavour reminds us of the famous avocado milk you could get from Alexandra Village Food Centre, only richer and with pearls. We couldn\u2019t get used to this odd pairing, though.\nOver 60 outlets, including #B1-03 Wisma Atria, 435 Orchard Rd, S238877. Open daily 10am-10pm. www.facebook.com/lihosg\n10/22\n10/22\nMilksha\nBrown Sugar Milk with Honey Pearls, $5.60\u00a0(RANKED #13)\nMilksha is the new Taiwanese kid on the block, having recently opened its first Singapore branch at Suntec City. Instead of the full-on earthiness of brown sugar, our first few sips of this drink is spiked with the fragrant floral sweetness of honey pearls. It\u2019s a refreshing change from the usual heavier brown sugar pearl milk with brown sugar pearls that\u2019s now sold everywhere. The fresh milk is nicely rich and thick, but we\u2019d prefer more brown sugar syrup in our cup. We can barely taste it, since the honey pearls overpower our drink\u2019s too-mild brown sugar flavour. However, milk and honey is a classic combo. Milksha\u2019s pearls here are pretty fab, cooked to an al dente, chewy finish. It\u2019s also sweeter than the average plain tapioca pearls and even brown sugar pearls, so you might want to order a lower sugar level than usual for your drink if it contains these babies. But if we had to choose: we still prefer the smoky, caramelised flavour of traditional brown sugar pearls.\n#02-375/376 Suntec City Tower 3, S038983 (above Uniqlo). Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/milkshasingapore\n11/22\n11/22\nJenjudan\nBrown Sugar Boba Milk, $5.20 (M), $6.50 (L)\u00a0(RANKED #12)\nUnlike the pretty, swirly ombre cups we see from brands like Tiger Sugar and R&B Tea, Taiwanese bubble tea shop Jenjudan\u2019s offering keeps all its brown sugar \u2014 pearls and all \u2014 at the bottom of the cup. The flavours come together pretty nicely once we\u2019ve given our cup a good shake and stir, though we find the pearls, milk and brown sugar syrup pretty standard (the pearls are made in Jenjudan\u2019s own Taiwanese factory, flown over to Singapore, and cooked in-store). It\u2019s a decent, serviceable cup for when you\u2019ve a brown sugar pearl milk craving, but nothing mind-blowing either.\n#B1-13 Citylink Mall, S039393. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.www.facebook.com/jenjudansg .\n12/22\n12/22\nBrown Sugar Milk with Pearl, $3.90\u00a0(RANKED #11)\nThis under-the-radar Chinese bubble tea chain has over 1,700 outlets worldwide, and two in Singapore. \u00a0It\u2019s known for its tea that\u2019s infused with Taiwanese brown sugar, though their milk version is also pretty yummy. The ratio of fresh milk to fragrant caramelised brown sugar is quite perfect, and not too sweet, plus the bouncy pearls are good to chew on.\nKurotaki Chabann, two outlets include #B1-49 Citylink Mall, 1 Raffles Link, S039393. Tel: 8823-8800. Open daily 10am\u201310pm. www.facebook.com/KurotakiSG\n13/22\n13/22\nSuperTea\nBrown Sugar Boba Milk, $4.90 (RANKED #10)\nSuperTea is the sister brand of Chinese bubble tea chain R&B Tea, also on\u00a0this list. We were told by the company\u2019s PR rep that the brown sugar pearl milk from the sister brands are the same, except R&B Tea\u2019s version comes with an optional layer of cheese br\u00fbl\u00e9e foam. Our takeaway brown sugar milk still tastes\u00a0pretty fresh and creamy even after making the hour-long trek back to the 8 DAYS office, with a thick layer of brown sugar syrup still attractively perched atop\u00a0the chilled Meiji full cream milk. Rich and\u00a0fragrant with delightfully bouncy\u00a0and caramelly pearls .\n9 Raffles Blvd, Millenia Walk #01-75, S039596. Open daily 10am\u20139pm. www.facebook.com/SuperteaSingapore\n14/22\n14/22\nBrown Sugar Boba Milk, $5.30\u00a0(RANKED #9)\nSingapore recently got its very first outpost for this massively popular bubble tea brand from Taiwan, which is famous for making its own brown sugar pearls and cooking them in a wok at each shop. The fresh milk used here is Meiji\u2019s 4.3 Deluxe Milk, which is said to be creamier than the average fresh milk brand. It\u2019s also the same milk that Tiger Sugar uses for its drinks. Xing Fu Tang puts far more brown sugar syrup in its drink than its rivals. Good news if you\u2019re into a full-on brown sugar flavour. But we found our drink too sweet, especially since we encountered crunchy bits of sugar granules that had escaped the blowtorch. And nope, you can\u2019t customise the sugar level for the drinks. Our rather stiff boba required a fair amount of chewing (our pals who tried Xing Fu Tang in Taiwan had the same experience, so it might be Xing Fu Tang\u2019s thang), though the brown sugar flavour that permeates each pearl is fab. Still, the overall drink is quite yummy: smooth, rich and infused with the earthy fragrance of caramelised brown sugar.\n#01-22 Century Square, S529509. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/XingfutangSG.\n15/22\n15/22\nMuYoo\nDirty Drink, $3.90\u00a0(RANKED #8)\nWe guess this drink is so named \u2019cos it\u2019s a \u2018dirty\u2019 version of milk with the\u00a0brown sugar syrup drizzled on it, and it\u2019s also a more sinful drink compared to MuYoo\u2019s signature light fruit-infused teas. Even after sitting around for a while, our fresh Farmhouse milk remains\u00a0rather rich and moreish with a decadent dose of melted brown sugar and slightly warm brown sugar pearls (which MuYoo's staff said were served that way for a softer bite). We enjoy\u00a0savouring the warm-cold contrast of the ingredients before we mix\u00a0everything up\u00a0to slurp. The Chinese brand\u2019s attractive packaging with a cute, squat cup and colourful carrier also scores points with us.\nThree outlets including #B1-67 Raffles City, 252 North Bridge Rd S179103. Open daily 10am-10pm. www.muyoo.com.sg\n16/22\n16/22\nHeyTea\nBr\u00fbl\u00e9e Bobo Tea, $4.50\u00a0(RANKED #7)\nAlthough it\u2019s better known for its lighter fruit-based teas, this Chinese bubble tea chain also launched a milk-based Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Bobo Tea (you can opt for either fresh milk or milky red tea as your base). We got the cuppa with Cow Head fresh milk, and found it pleasingly decadent with the earthy layer of brown sugar br\u00fbl\u00e9e on top. The brown sugar syrup used is cooked till it\u2019s the right amount of caramelly, and goes well with the rich milk and bouncy, mildly sweet brown sugar pearls.\nTwo outlets including #B4-29 Ion Orchard, S238801. Open daily 10am-10pm. www.facebook.com/heyteaofficial .\n17/22\n17/22\nBobii Frutii (8 DAYS Pick!)\nChildhood Memory, $4.80\u00a0(RANKED #6)\nHailing from Taiwan (where else?)\u00a0with local actor Nat Ho as a Singapore franchise co-owner, Bobii Frutii \u2019s selection of bubble teas involves fancy names like this Childhood Memory. Though we think only kids now will\u00a0remember guzzling on brown sugar milk with brown sugar pearls as, er, kids. That said, we have good memories of sipping on this. The caramelised sugar syrup\u00a0packs a lovely smoky-sweet flavour and is not overly saccharine, while the fresh Meiji\u00a0milk is full-bodied. The icing on the cake (or cup, ha ha)? The\u00a0faintly sweet house-made brown sugar pearls are served slightly warm and boast the right amount of chewiness.\n#04-K4 The Clementi Mall, S129588. Tel: 9773 4347. Open daily 11am-9.45pm. www.bobiifrutii.com.sg\n18/22\n18/22\nBrown Sugar Deerioca Fresh Milk, $5.30\u00a0(RANKED #5)\nThis signature drink is so simple yet so satisfying: chilled Meiji 4.3 Deluxe fresh milk (a more upmarket, richer version of regular Meiji milk) served with a huge scoop of warm 'Deerioca' pearls (what they quirkily christen their pearls here, thanks to the brand\u2019s deer mascot) dripping with brown sugar. The warm orbs are a joy to munch on with their super QQ texture, and infused with brown sugar flavour that, surprisingly, isn\u2019t too cloying and pretty balanced.\nTwo outlets including #02-06A/B Orchard Cineleisure, S239695. Open daily 12pm-10pm. www.the-alley.sg .\n19/22\n19/22\nFresh Milk with Brown Sugar Bubble, $5\u00a0(RANKED #4)\nThis tea specialist with a tongue-twister of a name from Taiwan recently opened its first outlet in Singapore in May this year, and has rapidly expanded to its current four outlets. It\u2019s apparently pretty popular; when we ordered our brown sugar milk drink at its Jem outlet in Jurong, we waited around 20 minutes for our drink. Perhaps it\u2019s \u2019cos they\u2019re very precise about their bubble tea orders; the teas used as a base for their drinks are painstakingly brewed via an espresso maker-like machine. But still, don\u2019t order anything if you\u2019re rushing to catch a movie. Our Fresh Milk with Brown Sugar Bubble is worth the wait when we\u2019re not in a hurry, though. It boasts an intense caramel flavour, full-bodied milk and fab chewy brown sugar pearls. The packaging is also pretty swish; each cup comes with a cardboard sleeve and rustic rope handles.\nFour outlets including L3-41, 313@Somerset, S238895. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/pg/chichasanchen.sg .\n20/22\n20/22\nBrown Sugar Boba Milk with Cheese Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, $5.80\u00a0(RANKED #3)\nWe have found the secret to fabulous brown sugar pearl milk: cheese foam. While Chinese chain R&B Tea \u2019s rendition is already very good on its own (fresh Meiji full-cream milk laced with dark, swirling globs of caramelised brown sugar and softly chewy pearls) \u2014 the cheese foam on top brings it to the next level. Stir in the cheesy layer (available only at its Marina Bay Sands, Oasis Terraces and Toa Payoh outlets), which the staff sears with a blowtorch upon order, and the drink becomes even creamier, with a smoky finish. Complex, delicious and worth the steeper price tag. R&B\u2019s offering ranked #2 in an earlier version of this story but has slipped to #3 because the standard of the drink dropped slightly (the brown sugar tasted slightly singed) when we tried it recently.\nSixteen outlets, including #B2-50 Rasapura Masters food court, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, 10 Bayfront Ave, S018956. Open daily Mon-Sat 10am-9pm; Sun 9am-9pm. www.facebook.com/rbteasg.\n21/22\n21/22\nBober Tea\nBrown Sugar Boba Fresh Milk, $3.80 (S), $4.80 (M)\u00a0(RANKED #2)\nDespite being a relatively new player with just two outlets in Bishan and Bukit Panjang and a recent pop-up stint at Takashimaya\u2019s atrium food fair, this bubble tea brand has quietly become a hit with Singaporeans. When we arrive at their newest Bukit Panjang Plaza outlet just after dinnertime, there\u2019s a long queue at the cashier. Interesting. We order their fresh cream foam-topped Brown Sugar Boba Fresh Milk and got an unremarkable-looking cup, with barely any brown sugar \u2018stripes\u2019. But this is a case of expectations not matching up to reality, as the drink is surprisingly really, really good. Bober Tea uses the same Meiji 4.3 Deluxe milk as Tiger Sugar, which we adore for its extra creaminess and gao-ness, and the melted brown sugar syrup, though dribbled sparingly, has a robust flavour. The pearls are also one of the best ones we\u2019ve tried so far; bouncy with a soft chewy finish and a gentle hint of brown sugar fragrance. Here\u2019s hoping they open more outlets in less ulu locations.\nTwo outlets including #01-01, 200 Bishan Rd (near Bishan MRT, beside 7-Eleven). Tel: 6262-0407. www.bobertea.sg .\n22/22\n22/22\nBrown Sugar Boba + Pearl with Cream Mousse, $5.30\u00a0(RANKED #1)\nThe \u2018winner\u2019 among all the brands we've tried. Tiger Sugar created the brown sugar pearl milk drink in Taiwan, and drew hysterical crowds when it arrived in Singapore recently last month. And we think there's substance behind the hype. Brown sugar, Meiji\u2019s 4.3 Deluxe milk (a more premium offering from the dairy brand) and a mix of gigantic chewy tapioca pearls (called boba here) plus tinier, softer pearls mingle to form this beautifully striking drink with brown stripes like a tiger\u2019s coat (hence, Tiger Sugar).\nBefore you down your cup, you\u2019re advised to shake it a total of 15 times. Why 15? \u201cWe did research and found it\u2019s the ideal number of times to shake to blend the drink perfectly,\u201d says Tiger Sugar MD, Trevor. For dairy lovers like us, this drink is just wonderful: indulgently creamy milk spiked with the sweet, earthy flavour of caramel syrup. The blend of big and small tapioca pearls adds fabulous texture. We also like that the mousse, made by whipping cream with an electric whisk, makes the drink extra luscious, yet not as jelak as we expected. Fun to slurp till the last drop.\nSix outlets including #B1-32 Capitol Piazza, 13 Stamford Rd, S178905. Open daily 11am-10pm. www.facebook.com/pg/tigersugarSGofficial. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nrelated stories\nSign up for the 8 DAYS weekly e-newsletter now!\nSign up\nNov 26, 2016 at 7:14pm PST\nRecommended For You\nBy clicking Sign Up, I consent to the Terms & Conditions\n\u00a9 Mediacorp / 8 Days.All rights reserved.\n"

There's nothing better than waking up slightly later on the weekends and hunting down the perfect brunch spot where you can order both breakfast and lunch items.\u00a0Whether it's\u00a0regular eggs on toast, ricotta pancakes or a bowl of pasta, hit up these spots in Singapore to fuel your lazy weekend with late breakfast meals and a cup (or two) of coffee.\nChinatown\nThe OG Aussie craft beer brewers have opened an outlet on our shores \u2013 complete with an in-house micro-brewery. The industrial-chic space is home to the brand's full line-up of craft beers including its flagship pale ale (from $12) alongside a selection of other brews exclusive to Singapore like the Club Street IPA (from $11). Pair your beers with bar snacks and Meditteranean-style bites on its full menu that's available from 11.30am to 10pm. If you're an early bird, don't fret. Little Creatures has teamed up with Schibello Coffee Roastery deliver your daily caffeine fix from 8am. It also offers a grab-and-go menu of breakfast treats including egg mayo sandwiches and warm croissants. Have more time to spare? Settle into a quiet corner where you can enjoy free Wi-Fi alongside some of Schibello's more unique pours that are meant to be sipped an savoured, such as the raspberry and pomegranate cold brew. There are also brunch dishes up for grabs including a granola and yoghurt bowl as well as eggs benedict served with grilled lobster.\nOutram\nPerhaps a signal of flagging caf\u00e9 food standards of late, this hot Neil Road joint appoints itself a 'gastro-caf\u00e9' to highlight its flavour-forward leanings. And The Populus definitely lives up to its tag. The rice and grain bowls ($18.50-$24) \u2013 they\u2019re topped with all manner of vegetables and meats like pulled pork, teriyaki salmon and truffle-scented seared wagyu \u2013 are Instagram favourites that taste as hearty as they photograph. As is the server-recommended seafood linguine ($24), with al dente spools of bisque-coated pasta next to nubs of crabmeat and scallops. Fork out another ten bucks to add a tail of butter-poached lobster.\u00a0Given that co-owners Andrew Lek and Kang Yi Yang borrow references from Down Under, smashed avocado shows up smeared on robust multi-grain bread along with vinaigrette-slicked musses of kale, broccoli, spinach and other greens on the Superfood Platter ($20). Because the other part of the owner equation here, local roasting outfit 2Degrees North Coffee Co, trains its barista team well enough to offer suggestions on the ideal milk-to-espresso ratio for the three signature blends of coffee ($4.50-$5.50) and single-origins ($6-$6.50).\nChinatown\nKeong Saik Road may be synonymous with alcohol, but it\u2019s sure able to cook up a fine cup of coffee. At Kafe Utu, you\u2019ll be transported to Africa the moment you step foot into the coffeehouse due to its wood and leather furnishing, as well as African-inspired paintings and portraits. The specialty house blend is called \u201cUbuntu\u201d \u2013 a combination of coffee beans from Uganda, Mexico, and Brazil \u2013 whereby you could have it black ($4.50) or with some Hokkaido milk ($6). What\u2019s a coffeehouse without any food? The ones here are really to impress. Try the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($18), which is accompanied by homemade sauces of Congo Bongo, Fresh Mango Chilli Marmalade and House Chilli. If you\u2019re feeling rather famish then, order up a Curried Avocado with Raw Garlic and Toast ($18) and Ricotta Hotcakes ($24) from the Brunch menu.\nSerangoon\nLocated right smack in the middle of Serangoon and Kovan MRT stations, Amber Ember may be the first to bring this slice of Australian gastronomy to our sunny shores. Splashed out in shades of dusty pink and warm neutrals, the Instagrammable caf\u00e9 offers six jaffle options ($6-$12) with its signature purple sweet potato mash. What the heck is a jaffle you ask? According to the Australians it's named after the jaffle iron invented in 1949 and is basically a toasted sandwich. The caf\u00e9 is extremely work-friendly with power points and free wifi; what\u2019s more, its relatively ulu location means lesser crowds, so you\u2019ll get a spot there for sure.\nGeylang\nFrom the custom DIY furniture to the charmingly inexperienced pair of owners as they fumble to put together your order, Brawn & Brains\u2019 unpretentiousness \u2013 closeted away in a hard-to-spot nook at Geylang\u2019s old badminton hall \u2013 oozes an infectious quality. Cramped yet cozy, there\u2019s no fancy latte art or overthought, intricate brunch menu to be had \u2013 just good, lovingly-brewed coffee (an organic, single-origin from Brazil, $3.50-$4) and co-owner Gwen Peh\u2019s homey and fragrant grapefruit yoghurt pound cake ($3.50/slice).\nKallang\nAnother in the clutch of cafes on Rangoon Road in Farrer Park, Brunches Cafe is a vintage-themed spot serving all day breakfast, gourmet sandwiches and cafe standards. Their high tea set, with slices of cake, mini tarts and sliders, is limited to ten sets a day, and is served in a bird cage. Apart from brunch staples like the Eggs Benedict ($13.9), Brunches Cafe also serves vegetarian options such as the Truffle Infused Mushroom Fiesta\u00a0($12.90) and brioche french toast ($11.9). Diners can also buy the furniture that they sit on, or shop at the vintage retail corner.\nCity Hall\nLocated at the foothills of Fort Canning Park, take a morning stroll and experience some greenery and fresh air outside before munching on some brunch at The Fabulous Baker Boy. With breakfast starting as early as 8.30am, tuck into some Cinnamon & Brown Sugar Pancakes ($13.50) with a Maple Cream Cheese Sauce topped with pecans. Or, you can start your day with the Eggs Benny ($13.50-$17) - 2 sets of poached eggs served on a Sourdough Brioche and rosemary potatoes on the side, topped with an Italian fashioned hollandaise sauce. If you fancy something sweet, feel fabulous about tucking into cakes and sourdough pastries with The Fabulous Baker Boy. With bakes named after all-time favourite divas like Beyonce ($9.50/slice) and Diana Ross ($9/slice), it's all about celebrating the sweet stuff and everything nice.\nOutram\nWith blue Peranakan-style tiled walls contrasting against dark timber floors, the rustic, hipster-pleasing interior features quirks like upside-down potted herb plants that teeter precariously from the ceiling, while natural light floods in from the window. Most dishes sport familiar-to-locals ingredients, but with restaurant-level finesse and more forgiving prices. The blackboards detailing the day's specials are always worth considering before you pick from the menu. For a light lunch, go for options like The LoKal Lobster Roll ($22). But if it's eggs you're after, the Pimp Your Breakfast beats any morning-after brunch: you have the freedom to assemble your very own plate. And what an assortment The LoKal puts out. Cram your breakfast with eggs done three ways ($5-$6), goopy cauliflower and cheese ($6), as well as your pick of protein \u2013 we recommend the salmon ($6) and mackerel ($6), both smoked in-house over cherry and apple wood chips.\nIf you manage to nab seats in this perpetually packed caf\u00e9, order the eggs Benedict ($18) for wobbly poached eggs with molten centres that ooze when broken into, charred bacon streaked only on the fatty edges, and soft brioche buns that bring together the whole affair. Too bad the accompanying spicy roasted potatoes are an unseasoned afterthought.\nFor a meatier dish, get your hands dirty with the 40 Hands Cubanos ($19). Fall-apart mojo pork, honey-smoked ham, melted cheese and piquant jalape\u00f1os are tucked into baguette halves from Tiong Bahru Bakery \u2013 except, unlike its menu description, the baguette doesn\u2019t crackle a peep when teeth meet crust. Still, it\u2019s greasy goodness with fries \u2013 or, if you really must, a salad \u2013 on the side. Best to come mid-afternoon to stave off the lunch crowd.\nRaffles Place\nLush greens, elegant furnishings and magnificent views of Marina Bay greet you as you step into this magical new CBD escape that is PS.Cafe One Fullerton. It has something for everyone, be it coffee and cake, business lunches, relaxing dinners, or post-work cocktails. Unwind in the bright and airy indoor area, complete with floor-to-ceiling windows and a private dining room that can accommodate up to ten. Cosy up at the intimate bar lounge or head to the open-air terrace for some cool bay breeze. Pop in for a quick two-course executive lunch ($34) or come during dinner for a range of exclusive new dishes such as the chargrilled skate with green harissa\u00a0($34)\u00a0or the moules vin\u00a0blanc\u00a0($24), which is\u00a0served with a side of crusty bread to dunk in the broth. Rest assured that you\u2019ll still find your favourites such as the PS. Truffle Shoestring Fries\u00a0($15),\u00a0PS. Burger\u00a0($29)\u00a0and the PS. Caesar Salad\u00a0($23)\u00a0on its all-day menu.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "May 29, 2019\nShopping in Seoul can mean browsing through antiques at a flea market or pricing designer handbags in a world-renowned boutique. Many of Seoul\u2019s shopping areas stay aglow 24 hours a day and feature everything from art galleries to rock concerts. For cheap deals brimming with culture, take your earth-friendly shopping bag to Insadong . Want to make more of a fashion splash? Glitzy Apgujeong is your home away from home.\nAGODA EXTRA: South Korean teenagers love their plastic surgery! In fact, most students entering university have already had some work done, and Korean parents are all for it. Because plastic surgery is such a popular \u201cpastime\u201d in Seoul, procedures are affordable and easy to book. You\u2019ll probably even find a pamphlet in your hotel room offering the best prices at the nearest cosmetic center!\n1. Bargain at a local market, or shop at fine fashion malls in MYEONGDONG\nYou\u2019ll get a lot more than you bargain for while shopping in Myeongdong . Hunt for souvenirs and cheap clothing at Myeongdong Street Market , or kick it up a notch by browsing through designer boutiques at Lotte Department Store and M PLAZA. For the latest fashion trends and a little weekend entertainment, head to Lotte Young Plaza and Noon Square.\n3. Hang with college kids who love flea markets and art in HONGDAE\nHome to Hongik University Seoul Campus , Hongdae caters to younger crowds and up-and-coming artists. The main draw to the area is Hongdae Shopping Street , favored for its cache of bargains and outdoor stage performances. On weekends, students flock to Hongik Children\u2019s Park, where local artists and craftsmen showcase their wares at Hongdae Free Market . The best place for indoor shopping in Hongdae is KT&G Sangsangmadang. This 11-story giant features an art gallery, live performance hall, cinema and an art square, where locals display their handmade arts and crafts.\n4. Flaunt a new Chanel bag in a plastic surgery center in APGUJEONG\nStep into Seoul\u2019s elite shopping district in Apgujeong to find the city\u2019s link to high-end fashions and the secrets to flawless beauty. The area\u2019s main point of interest is Apgujeong Rodeo Street , which not only contains wall-to-wall boutiques and accessory shops but also plastic surgery centers, beauty salons and dermatology clinics. Galleria Department Store is the district\u2019s other star attraction.\n5. Dig through antique stores and local memorabilia shops in the alleyways of INSADONG\nInsadong is one of Seoul\u2019s most historic districts, so it\u2019s no surprise that the area is brimming with antique stores, art galleries and teahouses. Aside from Insadong Ssamjigil , you won\u2019t find many major shopping malls here, but you will find Insadong Street . Make your way through the winding alleyways to find authentic hanbok (traditional clothing) and hanji (stationery), as well as local artwork, pottery and vintage toys. You easily can spend an entire day on Insadong Street , but while you\u2019re in the area, you should check out Kyungin Museum of Fine Art. Gana Art Center and Hakgojae Gallery are excellent stops, too.\nAll material herein \u00a9 2005-2020 Agoda Company Pte. Ltd.

This therapy balances the physical aspects of wellbeing and also the internal health of your cells.\nBioelectricity is the natural electrical charge in our bodies; it is the basis of life. The human body is electrical, your heart is driven by low levels of electricity and every single cell contains a low level of electrical charge for all functions including recovery and regeneration.\nHow does Hyperwave\u2122 Bioelectric Therapy help?\nHyperwave\u2122 Bioelectric Therapy can help by balancing your internal system.\n\u2022 Aligning your body\u2019s currents\nBioelectric currents can travel deep into muscles where traditional therapy cannot reach, to bring about deep healing. Injured or unhealthy tissues have a different electrical pattern than healthy tissue. During the therapy, the injured tissue absorbs the optimal bioelectric frequency and starts to resonate with this optimal frequency that is used to accelerate recovery. It is safe and a drug-free option.\nIn TCM, this is known as un-blocking \u2018Qi\u2019. Applying bioelectric therapy helps clear meridians of blocked Qi to enable energy to flow freely in your body to promote healing and regeneration.\n\u2022 Balances Nervous System\nBioelectricity helps activate and balance your nervous system. A balanced nervous system stabilizes and regulates the healthy function of organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines. In TCM, bioelectricity is known to open your meridians, for energy or Qi to flow freely through your cells.\n\u2022 Energizing cells\nStudies have shown that microcurrent with specific frequencies can increase ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production, which then provides cells with the energy required to regenerate and keep cells healthy. Some scientists consider aging due to a lack of ATP, that is, the amount of ATP available is not enough for the cells to maintain peak performance. Energized Cells = Healthier Body\nWhat happens during the therapy?\nCertified therapists use massage techniques to transmit the bioelectricity into your body. The electrical currents pass through their hands into your body, you feel a tingling sensation upon contact and subsequently feel the currents at a deep level. Deep muscle aches and sores are treated with no pain.\nTo enhance the detoxification benefits of this therapy, it is recommended that you drink lots of water and take a good quality enzyme supplement after the session.\nThis treatment is for you if you suffer from these symptoms:\n\u2022 Muscle aches, soreness\nHow to use Hyperwave\u2122 Bioelectric Therapy?\nThis therapy is safe for use every other day. We recommend booking a 60-minute session n every week or every other week. Some clients may opt for a 90-minute session if they desire.\n*Please check for contraindications before treatment.\nTCM Wuxing Massage\nThis massage focuses on harmonizing the body to rebalance energy by emphasizing on body work, joint release and deep breathing, creating a different experience. It incorporates passive stretching techniques performed by the therapist to increase the integration of action to relax muscle and nerve. The therapist does the work while you reap the benefits: increased flexibility, more oxygen in the blood, postural alignment, and elongated muscles.\nInvolves:\nActivation of meridian and trigger points\nRolling, pushing and pulling techniques\nPassive stretching techniques\nBenefits:\nImproves mobility. Incrementally improves range of movement\nDetoxifies\nActivates the body\u2019s self-healing mechanism\nImproves poor posture\nKey difference of Wu Xing: Systematic Passive Stretching (SPS):\nSystematic Passive Stretching (SPS) is a targeted passive stretching sequence to improve muscle tone, range of motion and energy flow. This is done by a trained therapist who does the stretching for the client without the client exerting any effort. The Wu Xing SPS is structured in such a way that helps your muscoskeletal system (muscle & bone system) melt and soften to lengthen patiently without injuries. It is based on TCM principles to move energy within your body. Stretching realigns any disorganized muscle fibres in the direction of the stretch. This realignment is what helps to rehabilitate scarred tissue back to health.\nSPS stretches soft tissues like tendons and ligaments. Tendons attach muscles to the bone; letting your muscles move bones. Ligaments attach bone to bone; they stabilize your joints. It is important to keep both mobile and supple for mobility, pain management and wellness. The trained therapist systematically stretches specific areas and is able to help the client move beyond their usual range of motion without hurting them. Such stretches are very difficult to perform by yourself.\nDue to this system\u2019s unique synergy of meridian activation and lymph flow technique, a sense of well\u00adbeing, lightness, improved energy and alertness can be felt just after one session.\nElements Ginseng Meridian Therapy\nThis treatment uses a series of specially shaped water buffalo horn tools to aid in the release of soft tissues. Each tool is shaped to specifically reach different levels and areas of your muscles. It enables a very deep treatment to give an intense release for recovery and feeling of wellness.\nBenefits:\nHelps to relieve tight muscles and trigger points using an active release technique with the aid of buffalo horns. It reaches deep layers that conventional massage treatments do not.\nHighlights:\nPhytonutrients: Enriched with Premium Red Ginseng Cream and customized herbal blend made using nanotechnology\nTraditional Chinese Medicine: Stimulates acupoints along the meridian pathways to unblock stagnant energy for improved body functions and health.\nWestern Medicine's study of muscles: Combines western knowledge of muscular structure with TCM's Water Buffalo Horn to loosen surface muscles and reach deeper into meridian points to relax tensed tendons to treat chronic pain.\nEnergy Massage Therapy\nCell Labs Energy Massage provides energy infusion into our body systems by combining energy ingredients and precise massage techniques. Your body enjoys physical vitality by taking in energy and distributing it through its internal energy system to the entire body. This energetic balance supports good health and a sense of well-being.\nThere are energy centres located all over our body and they are connected to our physical organs. In every culture, there is recognition of this energy system in the human body. When the energy supply to these bodily systems is disrupted, the body organs and systems are vulnerable to disease and injury. Keeping this energy system in balance is crucial for health.\nOne session of energy massage is equivalent to 6 hours of exercise.\nOpening of Energy Pathways\nWe activate two key energy centres to facilitate energy flow. They are:\nSolar plexus: The centre of our energy which radiates vital life energy throughout our entire body.\nCrown energy point: Situated at the top of the head and governs the nervous system and pituitary gland which regulates vital body functions and general wellbeing.\nDetox Ampoule\nRapidly removes excess water in the body, improves lymphatic system and blood circulation while supplying various vital nutrients.\nEnergy Cream \u2013 Tourmaline\nTourmaline energy cream is applied with infra-ray moxi to enhance energetic absorption.\nTourmaline is unique: It generates an electric charge and emit negative ions and far infrared rays; that means they are a source of energy itself. Tourmaline cream channels electrical energies into the one\u2019s being creating a flow of wholesome energy to all parts of the body for physical and mental health.\nInfra Moxi Massage\nInfra Moxi uses waves of energy that penetrate deep into the inner tissues, muscles and bones of the body to stimulate healing. Our technique uses varying rhythms, pressures, and massage techniques to create energy transference and has a deeply relaxing effect on the body.\nBlood Type Massage\nStress is any change in the environment that requires your body to react and adjust in response. Different blood type reacts differently to stress due to varying levels of hormones in the body. The blood that flows through your body influences your well-being more than most notice. Our handcrafted elixirs are designed to pair perfectly to bring your massage therapy to a higher level.\nEach unique elixir is a formulation of premium essential oils in calculated proportions for your blood type to achieve optimal benefits.\nBy scent or absorption through the skin, your mind and body are able to experience therapy and healing.\nBlood Type:\nA - Higher levels of cortisol: the stress hormone. Prone to problems from \u201ceveryday\u201d stress. As their adrenal glands overwork, they tire out thus causing more extreme response to stress.\nThe gift of touch in a massage combined with botanical aromatics ease anxiety and tension. Focus on head & shoulder areas to soothe tension headaches and migraine.\nB - Both the highest and lowest levels of cortisol response. When Type B is out of balance, they have difficulty in recovering from stress, disruption to friendly gut bacteria and suppression of immune function. Type B tends to react in a more extreme manner and need to find a balance.\nA rebalancing treatment to stabilize and calm the anxious mind, and boost immunity with pure botanical blend that balances moods and regulates stress hormones. Focus on legs and lower back for cardiovascular circulation.\nO - Lowest level of cortisol and adrenaline, but Type O\u2019s reaction to stress can cause an overproduction of adrenaline, which can make them more prone to anxiety when stressed. Type O is not able to break down adrenaline effectively and long-term imbalances can create burn out the nervous system.\nImproves metabolism to deal with excess adrenaline with energizing botanical blend that helps circulate bodily fluids and awaken the body system. Recommend focus on stomach and neck.\nAB - Sometimes A-like, sometimes B-like and sometimes a fusion of both. Type AB has the tendency to internalize emotions, especially anger and hostility, which is much more damaging to health than externalizing it. A combination of both calming and balancing is recommended to maintain the optimal balance.\nUnique Optimal Relaxation Elixir Blend seeks to calm the mind and balance the hormones. Focus on head and shoulder areas to soothe tension headaches or focus on legs and lower back for cardiovascular circulation depending on the symptoms.\nU (For all skin types) - Massage therapy boosts the immune system by stimulating \u201cnatural killer cells\u201d. Since therapeutic massage decreases cortisol that destroys natural killer cells, your immune system gets a boost.\n"

            "Five Taipei Spas Worth Visiting\nTaipei is overflowing with good massage spots. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about living here. But as a full-time graduate student with limited time to investigate (and somewhat limited Chinese skills), finding the right spot is sometimes difficult. But the FunNow App solved this problem handily, giving me everything I needed to know in English, letting me schedule my appointments in advance, and even providing me a real-time map to get me to the spa on time.\nUsing the FunNow App, I went out for five great massage treatments over a three-week period. Here\u2019s what I experienced at each one:\nLocated in the Songshan District, Zhuye is an easy-to- find, medium-luxury spa. They offered a standard array of massage experiences, ranging from neck and shoulder massages to a combo foot and full body massage. Upon arrival, I showed them my FunNow reservation and was quickly understood. Though the staff\u2019s English language skills were limited, a few of the massage therapists spoke enough English to facilitate communication.\nThe well-lit spa had a clean, warm and welcoming ambiance. The first floor features a row of stone foot-baths facing a very pretty inset aquarium with a variety of colorful fish and crustaceans. The other half of the space had rows of foot massage stations while the upstairs was devoted to full body massage. I was given burdock root tea to drink while soaking my feet and terry cloth pajamas to wear.\nMy masseuse was talented, intuitive, and able to moderate her pressure and techniques to match my comfort level. After my traditional reflexology foot massage, we moved upstairs for the body massage incorporating elements of Chinese and Swedish techniques. Zhuye was clean and comfortable, and I\u2019d absolutely go again.\nAddress: 1F, No. 167, Section 5, Nanjing East Road, Songshan District, Taipei City\nNearest MRT: Nanjing Sanmin Station\nProduct Experienced: Foot + Body massage 80 min\nForest Spa is located on the third floor of a nondescript building, making it feel like something of a hidden surprise. After taking a small elevator I walked into a large lobby decorated in wood motif with several large pieces of art on display including driftwood and metal shaped in the form of leaves. Ambient music created a super relaxing atmosphere.\nUpon check-in, I was given flower tea to drink and presented with several oils for my massage. All were lovely; I chose the lavender, as it seemed to fit in with the relaxing vibe. Staff were very friendly, and the receptionist spoke excellent English. While my masseuse\u2019s English was a bit more limited, it was more than sufficient for the task at hand. The private massage room was tastefully decorated with warm lighting. I received a 90-minute full body massage, the masseuse using the lavender oil I\u2019d chosen on my back, arms, hands, neck, legs, and feet.\nNear the end of my session, the masseuse took smooth, hot rocks and rolled them down my back and arms before placing them strategically on my back. Removing the rocks, she wrapped hot, wet towels around my arms and legs and laid another towel on my back, covering me for several minutes. Afterward, I was led to a common room and given tea and a tray of snacks. The hot tea was intended for eye health while the cool dessert soup was good for the skin. A small bowl of fruit was included. Having received one of the best massages I\u2019d had in a long time, I left totally relaxed.\nAddress: 3rd Floor, No. 263, Linsen North Road, Zhongshan District, Taipei\nNearest MRT: Zhongshan Temple\nProduct Experienced: Hot Stone Rolling + Top Oil Massage 90 min\nA short walk from the MRT station, Zen Yin Chia Spa was particularly easy to find thanks to the large cartoon foot mascots displayed outside. The space is a long rectangle with a line of foot massage chairs up front. Further back is a dressing room, bathroom and more secluded rooms for body massage. Much of the spa is decorated with different versions of the whimsical cartoon feet.\nThe spa staff was friendly and their English sufficient. Upon check-in, I was handed a reflexology map with English translations before being seated in a reclining chair with a comfortable neck pillow and soft blanket. After being given my choice of beverage, I was brought over to the foot soaking station, where I was given a quick but thorough shoulder and neck massage as my feet soaked. Afterward, both feet were massaged for thirty minutes each, during which time the reflexology map proved particularly useful as I was able to refer to it when the masseuse worked on areas that I found particularly tender.\nMassage style was typical reflexology, focusing first on the bottom, sides, and tops of the feet before moving on to the calves and knees. My masseuse regularly checked in verbally during the session to make sure the pressure was acceptable. At one point, she noted that the reflexology points for my eyes were particularly tender; after the massage she presented me with an eye mask to take home. I found this a particularly nice touch!\nAddress: No. 22, Lane 135, Section 1, Zhongshan N Rd, Zhongshan District, Taipei City\nNearest MRT: Zhongshan Temple\nSpa Experience Four: Lantingfu(\u862d\u5ead\u5e9c)\nLantingfu was a tastefully decorated spa with a friendly staff boasting good English language skills. Checking in, I was offered tea and a warm towel to wipe off my face and hands. While drinking my tea, the receptionist presented me with several oils to choose for my massage. The downstairs was devoted to foot massages. Upstairs had deeper square pools for foot baths that allowed me to soak up to my calves. My treatment began with a 15-minute soak in the lemongrass-scented waters of this deep pool\nFollowing this, a full-body essential oil massage with jasmine oil, including a ten-minute scalp treatment. My masseuse was named Purple and her massage technique was excellent. She even popped my back several times which relieved a lot of school-related tension.\nDuring the massage, I was asked to pick an area for extra attention. As I tend to hold a lot of stress in my neck and shoulders, I chose these areas. After the massage I was taken to the lounge area to enjoy a light snack of fresh fruit with tea. Light bamboo music played throughout the spa which added to the relaxing ambiance. I left on cloud nine, the delightful scent of jasmine oil lingered on my skin for the rest of the day.\nAddress: No. 6, Lane 30, Lequner Road, Zhongshan District, Taipei City\nNearest MRT: Jianan Rd. Station\nProduct Experienced: Essential Oil Treatment 105 min\nSpring and Autumn\u2019s Anhe branch is located on a stretch of road in the Da\u2019an district filled with a number of medium to high-end spas. This particular spa is set up inside of two buildings a few doors down from one another, with the second shop being used during peak hours. Though clean and comfortable, Spring and Autumn has a more no-nonsense health spa vibe, with little of the usual new age decor (salt lamps, scented candles, etc.) found at some other places of similar price level. The spa is decorated with a purple forest motif. The front of the spa is devoted to foot soaking spas with the massage cubicles located further back behind the curtain.\nI got to the Spring and Autumn Massage just after lunch on a Monday afternoon and was greeted in unison by the staff. Though mid-day, the place seemed to be fairly popular, and after checking in at the front desk I was brought down the block to the overflow location. After taking off my shoes, I changed into massage pajamas and lay on the table, where I was covered by a thicker than usual blanket. My 60-minute full body back massage was performed without oil and very little skin-to-skin contact. My masseuse was well trained in standard reflexology and intermuscular kneading. English ability of the staff is limited to massage prices and basic massage-related English (softer, harder, etc.).\nThe massage itself was fine, nothing out of this world but a perfectly serviceable Chinese style massage focused on relieving muscular tension. Spring and Autumn offers an acceptable service for the price range.\nAddress: \u00a0No. 37, Section 2, Anhe Rd, Da\u2019an District, Taipei City\nNearest MRT: Xinyi Anhe\n1 reply to Five Taipei Spas Worth Visiting\nRECENT POSTS\nSubscribe to Blog via Email\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\nJoin 57 other subscribers\n"

Some people feel more relaxed after they write about their feelings. One way is to keep a journal.\nUse guided imagery. With guided imagery, you imagine yourself in a certain setting that helps you feel calm and relaxed.

This light causes soft tissue\n                                    coagulation which leads to remodeling of the collagen within the dermis.\nAt the end of the treatment, the problem area is treated with a seaweed mask which\n                                    assists in the firming of skin tone and also to regenerate the skin surface to\n                                    reveal a younger silhouette.\nHAIR REMOVAL TREATMENT\nFor a smoother Yu(\u6c64)\nPain-free hair reduction. The hair root is destroyed, thus giving immediate reduced\n                                    hair regrowth. A series of 4-8 treatments depending on individuals is required to\n                                    ensure long term effects. This treatment can avoid the frustration of ingrown hairs\n                                    and the \u201cspiky\u201d feeling when fine hair starts growing out.\n"

It relaxes the mind and muscles, whilst the mineral\n                                    content of the water works to alleviate numerous ailments.\nBUBBLE BATH\nInspired by the natural hot spring regions of Thailand and Japan, our Bubble Baths\n                                    are filled with water infused with carefully balanced minerals and set at a warm,\n                                    inviting temperature to provide an authentic and holistic bathing experience.\nSODA BATH\nThe Soda Spa is the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. Soaking in carbon\n                                    dioxide-rich water increases blood oxygen levels, which improves circulation,\n                                    reduces high blood pressure, and detoxifies the blood, improving skin elasticity,\n                                    and contributing to a youthful glow.\nSILK BATH\nFilled with tiny bubbles, this bath offers a deeply cleansing and relaxing\n                                    experience.

These properties work\n                                    together to make the Silk Bath highly effective for relieving rheumatic and\n                                    arthritic aches and pains as well as relieving mental stresses.\nCOLD BATH\nRefreshing and invigorating, the Cold Bath\u2019s 17-19\u0e4dC water stimulates the body\u2019s\n                                    natural energy and nerve endings. The contrasting temperature of this bath to the\n                                    other hot baths makes it a wonderfully enlivening bath to dip into. The Cold Bath\n                                    also has aesthetic anti-aging benefits, closing the pores and tightening the skin.\nSTEAM ROOM\nAt 100% humidity, our Steam Room\u2019s wet heat opens the pores and detoxifies the skin\n                                    and body.

            "Hotel picks for the ultimate relaxing getaway\nImage zoom\nWhy do you visit a spa? If you're like most women, you're looking for an escape from the daily grind. Maybe you need a little help jump\u2013starting a healthier lifestyle too, but your real motivation is to get away from it all and focus on you. To help you create a completely individualized experience, the newest crop of spas is adding customized features and rituals tailored to your needs, concerns, and preferences. (Hate New Age music? Cue up Fergie.) From desert decadence to beachside luxury, these 10 new spas will prepare you to face the world again.\nChill Out In the City\nThe Spa at Mandarin Oriental\nAtlanta, Georgia\nEver wonder what the lady\u2013who\u2013lunches lifestyle would be like? Now you can act the part with a stay at Mandarin Oriental, Atlanta. The hotel towers over the upscale Buckhead neighborhood, and The Spa at Mandarin Oriental, Atlanta is a luxurious retreat spread over two floors. Prior to any treatment (of which there are endless options), you can experience the spa's heat and water facilities to soothe muscles and prepare for whatever zen-like therapy you're about to have. Afterward, take a dip in the 60-foot lap pool.\nDetails: Treatments start at $100, rooms at $369; mandarinoriental.com/atlanta\nFind Serenity In the Desert\nThe Spa at Encantado\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\nThere's something magical about the Southwest, and many spas have tried to capitalize on that feeling. The Spa at Encantado, located just seven miles from Santa Fe Plaza in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, gets it right. There are 65 adobe-style casitas, each equipped with heated bathroom floors and private terraces to fulfill your nesting tendencies, but there's also a communal fire pit, an outdoor sculpture garden, and an art gallery to encourage you to go outside and meet your fellow guests. After a day of hiking, biking, or horseback riding in the nearby Santa Fe National Forest, cool your heels with a chili pepper foot\u2013warmer treatment before you indulge in the Ojo Caliente Purification Ritual. You'll start with an exfoliation (the aesthetician uses a loofah\u2013like cloth made with cactus fibers), follow that with a dip in the heated pool and a few minutes inhaling eucalyptus in the steam room, then finish with a fresh rainwater rinse and warm\u2013blanket wrap.\nDetails: Treatments start at $150, rooms at $475; encantadoresort.com.\nEnjoy Glitz at the Beach\nThe Ritz\u2013Carlton St. Thomas Spa\nSt. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands\nThis resort offers the high\u2013end luxury you expect from the Ritz, but the white\u2013sand beaches surrounding it tone down the posh factor and give the place a laid\u2013back vibe. When you arrive, pour yourself into a hammock, take a windsurfing lesson, or set off for a chartered sunset sail on a 53\u2013foot catamaran. Cap your day with a moonlit massage in a beachside cabana. In keeping with the surroundings and \"ritz\u2013y\" reputation, the spa features three facials and one body treatment that incorporate Prada Beauty products.\nDetails: Treatments start at $85, rooms at $269; ritzcarlton.com.\nGet Back to Nature\nCary, North Carolina\nSituated next to a 5,600\u2013acre state park where you can hike, run, bike, and canoe, the Umstead considers nature the best stress reliever. You even get an outdoorsy feel inside the spa, thanks to the earth tones, a meditation garden, and glass walls that keep the area drenched in light. Spa\u2013goers choose from nature\u2013infused treatments like the Red Flower Hammam Tibetan Ritual, a steam and massage that use citrus, cedarwood, and clay.\nDetails: Treatments start at $105, rooms at $295; theumstead.com.\nBreathe Easy in the Mountains\nThe Westin Riverfront Resort and Spa\nBeaver Creek, Colorado\nEarn your spa treatment by taking the resort's new gondola up the mountain for a few hours of hiking or biking on some of the 148 ski runs. At the bottom, reward yourself with a soak in a hot tub on the banks of the Eagle River. Then head to the 15,000\u2013square\u2013foot Spa Anjali for the Himalayan Journey to Serenity: Aestheticians apply an aromatic scrub of almond meal, date seeds, neem (which has antiseptic properties), and essential minerals, then follow it with a pressurepoint stimulation called Marmassage.\nDetails: Treatments start at $75, rooms at $250; westinriverfront.com.\nClimb, Hike, and Spa\nSpa at Montelucia\nParadise Valley, Arizona\nFrom picture\u2013perfect views to guided hikes, rock climbing, and rappelling, Camelback Mountain\u2013one of the most famous landmarks in Phoenix\u2013is always looming large at this Spanishstyle hotel and spa. A 90\u2013minute hike on a steep trail (many people run it) will put you on top, and by the time you get down, you'll be ready to park yourself in the 31,000\u2013square\u2013foot spa. Try Hammam\u2013Style Therapy, an ancient Turkish bathhouse custom that includes having your back scrubbed, soaking in a whirlpool, sitting under a cold waterfall, and then lying on a heated platform.\nDetails: Treatments start at $215, rooms at $225; montelucia.com.\nTake a Break from Your Routine\nMySpa at the Fairmont Hotel\nChicago\nA city spa typically caters to more locals and business travelers than a destination spa does, and the creators of MySpa have tried to offer services targeted to that pop\u2013in, pop\u2013out market. Need some relaxation between meetings? The 60\u2013minute Power Treatment features a half\u2013hour massage followed by a facial and manicure performed simultaneously. The hotel's location couldn't be more convenient either: It's steps from the Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute, Millennium Park, and Lake Michigan.\nDetails: Treatments start at $135, rooms at $249; fairmont.com/chicago.\nStay Sin-Free In Sin City\nThe Spa at Trump International\nLas Vegas\nWhile the latest Trump property doesn't have a casino or an entertainment venue, you'll be treated like a high roller regardless. The 24\u2013karat gold and glass tower comes with all the luxury you can dream of, including TVs built into the bathroom mirrors and a 24\u2013hour Trump concierge who can arrange everything from laundry service to helping you find just the right outfit for a big night out. As soon as you check into the 10,000\u2013squarefoot spa, you'll pick one of five personal intentions: calm, balance, purify, heal, or revitalize. Your choice will determine everything from the essential oils and aromas used during your treatments to the flavor of tea you're served and the music you listen to on your spa iPod.\nDetails: Treatments start at $40, rooms at $349; trumplv.com.\nRelax Palm Beach-Style\nSinger Island\nSinger Island, Florida This beachfront property, a Luxury Collection Resort on Florida's Gold Coast, incorporates the ocean everywhere you look, from the water walls in the spa entrance to the treatment suites named after the world's seas. The theme makes it easy to float away midsession, whether you're getting the Bohai Ancient Tibetan Treat (a combo of aromatherapy, rhythmic breathing, and chanting) or the Caribbean Wake\u2013 Up Call, which includes exfoliation with fresh citrus fruit and crushed olive stones as well as massage using grapefruit, juniper, and rosemary. Once you're sufficiently invigorated, try one of the resort's regular beachside yoga classes or power walks, or spend the day kayaking through the mangroves (the hotel can arrange excursions).\nDetails: Treatments start at $85, rooms at $199; luxurycollection.com/singerisland.\nAdvertisement\nComments\nAdvertisement\nClose\nTell us what you think...\nSubmit\nClose\nTop 10 Best Places to De-stress\n"

            "8 Quick Things You Can Do To De-Stress Right Now\nStress at work \u2014 be it rushing a deadline for a report or dealing with demanding clients \u2014 is often unavoidable.\nHow You Can Unwind Right Now\nStress at work \u2014 be it rushing a deadline for a report or dealing with demanding clients \u2014 is often unavoidable. While some level of pressure is good to keep you motivated at work, excessive stress can be overwhelming and harmful to your physical and emotional well-being. Try these quick fixes at the office to relieve the mounting stress.\n1. Take a Power Nap\nIt sounds counterintuitive \u2014 especially when there\u2019s plenty of work waiting for you \u2014 but a short 15-20 minute shut-eye can help you \u201creset\u201d your frazzled system. You\u2019ll feel more energised and alert to tackle the next task when you wake up from your short nap.\nResearch also shows that taking naps promote alertness on the job [1] , reduces sleepiness and improves cognition performance [2] . This could help you to solve problems faster, or get over that mental block, hence clearing the backlog of work more efficiently. Also remember to get enough sleep (7-9 hours daily for an adult) to have better concentration and focus.\n2. Stretch It Out\nWe\u2019ve all experienced it before \u2014 when we\u2019re stressed, our bodies tense up. Hunching over your desk, trying to meet the deadlines, won\u2019t do your back, shoulders, and neck muscles any favours. A quick way to get relief is to get up and streeetch [3] those tensed muscles.\nYou could also try chair yoga [4] , a gentle form of yoga that can be easily done in the office. Start with the seated chest lift \u2014 this move opens your chest and stretches your back. Sit at the edge of your chair with your feet flat on the ground and your hands rested behind you at the back of the seat, fingers pointing away. Inhale, lift your chest and then exhale before releasing your hands. Repeat this move five times.\n3. Relax your Senses by Seeing Green\nHuman beings have a natural affinity for elements of nature, which has the innate ability to heal our body and mind, as well as improve our mood [5] . The Japanese\u2019s Shinrin-yoku (which means \u201cforest bathing [6] \u201d), the idea of being in wild and natural places, and taking strolls in zen gardens are ways to improve our overall well-being. They evoke a sense of serenity and inner peace that heals the mind, body and soul and allows one to set aside some time for self-reflection.\nDon\u2019t worry if there isn\u2019t a zen garden or park nearby. You can still relax by helping to tend to the office plants, or even better, build your own terrarium. Observing the plants growing slowly day by day can be highly therapeutic; open terrariums, like office plants, can also eliminate odours and absorb pollutants in the air.\nRelax your mind and find inner peace with a miniature zen garden set that you could either make or buy. The repetitive act of combing the sand and arranging the stones has a calming effect. It also trains the mind to focus on the present, freeing it from stray thoughts and worries.\n4. Relax your Senses with Calming Music or Nature Sounds\nAre there times when you absolutely need to focus but are distracted by sounds in the office? It might be the phone ringing or worse, the distant drilling of construction, and they\u2019re all leaving you frustrated. Find some inner quiet by listening to calming music and sounds of nature. The sounds of crashing waves, trickling raindrops, chirping birds and other sounds of nature and calming music are amongst the most soothing and pleasurable states. They can help the brain to relax, focus better and boost your efficiency at work.\nResearch has shown that employees who connect more with nature at work reported fewer stress-related complaints [7] . Listening to nature sounds can help one recover from mental stress [8] more quickly, minimise the negative effects of depression and improve your mood to be more positive. You don\u2019t have to spend any money to gain access to such music, check out YouTube as there are many sounds of nature videos that you can listen to. Here\u2019s [9] one to last you for the next four hours.\n5. Think Positive\nChanging your mindset and having a positive attitude can make you happier.\n6. Revive Your Mind with Creative Breaks\nBefore you dive your head into rushing the last-minute presentation and stressing yourself out, grab some colour pencils for some creative doodling. The concentration of the mind and the positive emotions evoked through the spontaneous act of drawing keep it in the present, declutters your thoughts and makes one happy.\nDoodling is certainly not a mindless activity as it actively engages your brain and hones the processes that help us to multi-task, focus and plan. If you are not into doodling, try your hands at origami and turn the colourful paper into creative animals and objects. Both are great ways to recharge your mind, de-stress and to discover the artist inside you.\n7. Revive with Mindfulness\nTake a few minutes to practise mindful breathing exercise every day. It will help your mind and body to relax. Mindfulness is the practice of focusing your attention on the present moment. Studies [12] show that mindfulness helps to increase tolerance of negative emotions [13] and works as a promising intervention for treating anxiety and mood problems [14] .\nMake the effort to take short breaks during work and incorporate some simple mindfulness techniques like taking deep breaths and counting them with your eyes closed. A short mindfulness exercise every day works wonders to help you re-focus and clear your mind. Here\u2019s [15] a useful link that you can try.\n8. Talk It Out with a Co-worker or Friend\nIf you\u2019re stressed out at work or feeling upset with an annoying colleague, don\u2019t let the problem worsen by bottling it up. Rant to (or instant message) a friend or co-worker about it and you\u2019ll feel instantly better.\nSharing your troubles with your co-worker or friend can help you relieve stress and get different perspectives on how to tackle these issues. By confiding your issues with people you trust, you can also draw renewed strength and love from them, learn from their experiences and feel more energised to manage the work stress.\n9. Manage Your Time\nPlan your time well so that you can complete tasks on time. Break large tasks into smaller manageable parts.\n\u200bRead these next:\nReferences\nTakahashi, M., Nakata, A., Haratani, T., Ogawa, Y., & Arito, H. (2004, Aug).

While some level of pressure is good to keep you motivated at work, excessive stress can be overwhelming and harmful to your physical and emotional well-being. Try these quick fixes at the office to relieve the mounting stress.</p><h2>1. Take a Power Nap</h2><p style=\"text-align&#58;center;\">\u200b\u200b<img src=\"/sites/assets/Assets/Categories/Mind%20N%20Balance/being-stressed.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin&#58;5px;\" /></p><p>It sounds counterintuitive \u2014 especially when there\u2019s plenty of work waiting for you \u2014 but a short 15-20 minute shut-eye can help you \u201creset\u201d your frazzled system. You\u2019ll feel more energised and alert to tackle the next task when you wake up from your short nap.</p><p>Research also shows that taking naps promote alertness on the job<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, reduces sleepiness and improves cognition performance<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. This could help you to solve problems faster, or get over that mental block, hence clearing the backlog of work more efficiently. Also remember to get enough sleep (7-9 hours daily for an adult) to have better concentration and focus.\n</p><p>\n<strong>Related&#58;\n<a href=\"https&#58;//www.healthhub.sg/programmes/117/goodsleep\" title=\"Sleep Well, Live Better\">Sleep Well, Live Better</a></strong></p><h2>2. Stretch It Out</h2><p>We\u2019ve all experienced it before \u2014 when we\u2019re stressed, our bodies tense up. Hunching over your desk, trying to meet the deadlines, won\u2019t do your back, shoulders, and neck muscles any favours. A quick way to get relief is to get up and\n<em>streeetch</em><a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> those tensed muscles.</p><p>You could also try chair yoga<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, a gentle form of yoga that can be easily done in the office. Start with the seated chest lift \u2014 this move opens your chest and stretches your back. Sit at the edge of your chair with your feet flat on the ground and your hands rested behind you at the back of the seat, fingers pointing away. Inhale, lift your chest and then exhale before releasing your hands. Repeat this move five times.</p><p>\n<strong>Related&#58;\n<a title=\"Get Moving in Your Cubicle\" href=\"https&#58;//www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/918/youre-movable-in-your-cubicle\">Moves You Can Do In Your Cubicle</a></strong></p><h2>3.

The Japanese\u2019s\n<em>Shinrin-yoku</em> (which means \u201cforest bathing<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>\u201d), the idea of being in wild and natural places, and taking strolls in zen gardens are ways to improve our overall well-being. They evoke a sense of serenity and inner peace that heals the mind, body and soul and allows one to set aside some time for self-reflection.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry if there isn\u2019t a zen garden or park nearby. You can still relax by helping to tend to the office plants, or even better, build your own terrarium. Observing the plants growing slowly day by day can be highly therapeutic; open terrariums, like office plants, can also eliminate odours and absorb pollutants in the air.</p><p>Relax your mind and find inner peace with a miniature zen garden set that you could either make or buy. The repetitive act of combing the sand and arranging the stones has a calming effect. It also trains the mind to focus on the present, freeing it from stray thoughts and worries.</p><p>\n<strong>Related&#58;\n<img src=\"/sites/assets/Assets/Categories/Mind%20N%20Balance/cool-graphic-designer-at-work.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin&#58;5px;\" />\n</p><p>Are there times when you absolutely need to focus but are distracted by sounds in the office? It might be the phone ringing or worse, the distant drilling of construction, and they\u2019re all leaving you frustrated. Find some inner quiet by listening to calming music and sounds of nature. The sounds of crashing waves, trickling raindrops, chirping birds and other sounds of nature and calming music are amongst the most soothing and pleasurable states. They can help the brain to relax, focus better and boost your efficiency at work.</p><p>Research has shown that employees who connect more with nature at work reported fewer stress-related complaints<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. Listening to nature sounds can help one recover from mental stress<a href=\"#footnotes\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> more quickly, minimise the negative effects of depression and improve your mood to be more positive.

            "Deep Tissue Oil Massage\nDeep Tissue Massage breaks up and releases the built-up toxins by loosening the muscles. With the toxins released, blood and oxygen can circulate, as they should through one\u2019s body. Being properly hydrated before you go to your massage appointment and drinking plenty of water after one of these massages is highly recommended.\nSwedish Oil Massage\nA Swedish body massage is the perfect way for anyone who is overly worked and stressed out to relax their body and mind. During this massage the therapist will use several techniques on the muscles, ligaments, nerves, and soft tissues all over your body. As the therapist relaxes the muscles the lymph system will have the ability to flush out all of the metabolic waste from the muscles. This will help you to heal faster.\nHot Stone Oil Massage\nThe premise behind hot stone massage therapy is that the direct heat of the stones relaxes muscles, allowing the therapist access to their deeper muscle layers. Combining hot stone protocols with a full body massage provides a very healing and effective experience. The hot stones also expand blood vessels, which encourages blood flow throughout the body. The hot stones have a sedative effect that can relieve chronic pain, reduce stress and promote deep relaxation.\nShiatsu Massage\nShiatsu is a traditional form of therapy from Japan. By balancing the flow of energy in the meridians, Shiatsu can relieve many conditions, help prevent the build-up of stress, and restore vitality and well-being. Literally translated as \u2018finger pressure\u2019, Shiatsu uses comfortable pressure from the thumbs and palms applied to the energy channels and points in the body. Shiatsu may also include gentle stretches and rotations of the limbs and joints.\nADDITIONAL THERAPY\nCupping Therapy\nCupping therapy\u00a0facilitates healing with blood flow, as well as the flow of \u201cqi\u201d in the body. Qi is a Chinese word meaning life force.\u00a0Cupping increases blood circulation to the area where the cups are placed. This can relieve muscle tension, which can improve overall blood flow and promote cell repair. It can also help form new connective tissues and create new blood vessels in the tissue. People use cupping to complement their care for a host of ailments and conditions.\nScraping Therapy\nScraping to release petechiae\u00a0 to the surface of the skin, forces more blood and oxygen to the area treated which helps to nourish those cells. And the red spots on the skin become a byproduct that signals the body to do a sweep up of the area so that it eliminates both the dead blood cells as well as other toxins that surfaced towards the skin during the\u00a0 Scraping process.\u00a0After a treatment, the patient often has immediate relief from pain, headaches, fever, chills, cough, chest pains, nausea, stiffness, etc. After a series of treatments Scraping is able to release enough toxins to allow the body to find inner balance.\nScrubs & Body Polish\nA Scrub or body polish is a spa treatment which exfoliates the skin on your body leaving it feeling fresh, smooth, moisturised and soft. An abrasive product is rubbed vigorously, and massaged across and into your skin, and is then rinsed away to reveal a moisturised layer of fresh, clean and smooth skin.\nEar Candling / Ear Coning\nEar Candles can benefit conditions affecting the head and ears such as sinus congestion, ear noises and excessive earwax.The rising air through the column of the candle and gentle natural movement of the flame serve to gently massage the ear drum. This has an immediate subjective effect of regulating ear pressure. Users often describe a soothing, light sensation in the ear/head area and a general calming, relaxing effect.\nAROMATHERAPY\nAromatherapy\nAromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that uses natural plant extracts to promote health and well-being. Sometimes it\u2019s called essential oil therapy. Aromatherapy uses aromatic essential oils medicinally to improve the health of the body, mind, and spirit. It enhances both physical and emotional health.\nLemongrass Essential Oil\nLemongrass Essential Oil has many properties that make it highly beneficial to the health of your skin.

Priding itself as the biggest nightclub in the city, the indoor adult playground stretches over 2,300-square-metres across three floors with sky-high ceilings that tower up to 30 metres, and features a giant indoor Ferris wheel that offers revellers an unparalleled view of the nightclub.

Here, hungry night owls can feast on classic post-party grub including BBQ Pulled Pork Tacos and NY Beef Frank hotdogs. We'd highly recommend you to make the most at Kilo Lounge as it's been confirmed that it is ceasing operations on December 31, 2019.\nRochor\nNot a nightclub per s\u00e9, but it sure turns up the temperature later into the night.

            "10 Unbelievable Ladies' Night Deals in Singapore\nGetting through the workweek can be painful. Come mid-week, we are left craving for a much-deserved break, and hoping for a quick pick-me-up. Ladies' night is now a thing and countless restaurants and bars have adopted the idea into their stores. With that, we have put together a list of the hottest ladies night hangout spots in Singapore. Expect fantastic ambience and some stellar ladies night specials which are a sin to miss out on!\nSo put on your best work slash party attire, call up your best girlfriends and head out to any of these hot ladies hangout spots for some Wednesday night fun!\nLocated on the 71st floor of Swiss\u00f4tel The Stamford, rest assured that you will be in for the best night skyline view of Singapore. Seating options are vast here from bar counter stools for some cocktail action to high chairs by the floor-to-ceiling windows and not forgetting the long sofas to accommodate a bigger group of ladies.\nGood news! ladies enter for free every Thursday of the year with four complimentary drinks (from midnight till closing) to boot. Enjoy free-flow vodka cranberry and Cointreau coke from 10pm to 1am while grooving to Hip Hop and R&B beats from popular DJs around the region.\nAs soon as the sun sets, red lights and laser displays transform the space into the snazziest spot in town. Exciting themed nights and performances from raised cages are a norm here so you can look forward to that as well!\nBar Rouge\u2019s crafty cocktails are the highlight at the bar with about 15 varieties to choose from. The Thai Basil Mojito makes for a good starter with its refreshing concoction of Bacardi Carta Blanca, Thai basil, calamansi and brown sugar.\nNext up is the classic, Mr & Mrs Rouge. Some 42 Below Vodka, raspberry and blueberry pur\u00e9e, lemon juice as well as cranberry and vanilla syrup are thrown in the cocktail shaker. The aftertaste is fruity yet punchy, making it another easy sundowner. If you are not too keen on being adventurous, have the Cosmopolitan, Singapore Sling or Mai Tai.\nAlso, sides and snacks always taste better when accompanied by drinks. The Karaage Chicken is served with chilli powder for some fiery kick and burnt lemon. The Rock Shrimp is essentially thick battered fried prawns that come topped with mango salsa and wasabi mayo. Tangy and juicy, both of these gets a thumbs-up from us.\nHowever, do note that no flip flops, open-toed sandals, singlets or Bermuda pants are allowed after 10pm. So make sure to pick out the best outfit and heels you have before leaving home!\nAddress: 2 Stamford Road, Level 71, Swissotel the Stamford, Singapore 178882\nOpening Hours:\nTuesday: 6pm-1am\nWednesday-Thursday: 6pm-3am\nIf you frequent the bars of Clarke Quay a lot, Senor Taco must not be a foreign place to you. They are known for their great in-house tacos (well, duh) and for having their own tortilla factory in Singapore. Apart from that, did you know that they host an exclusive ladies\u2019 night event every Wednesday at 7pm?\nNothing beats nailing a Mexican dance routine to relieve the mid-week stress. Round up your favourite girls to a salsa dance session before rewarding yourselves with one-for-one passionfruit mojitos. Enjoy free flow of Margaritas, Mojitos, and white wine from 10pm to midnight for a very affordable price - sounds too good to be true, we know that too.\nThe Coronita tells the story of two famous Mexican classics - a tangy frozen lime margarita and Corona beer - meeting in a chilled glass. Makes for a great photo opportunity with even greater taste.\nThe Michelada is salty and spicy with a hint of sweetness all in one. To summarise, it will remind you of a Bloody Mary with a dip of pepper in it.\nYou will find the likes of authentic tacos, quesadillas, botana here but the beverages at Senor Taco go really well with their Guacamole & Chips. Other suitable side pairings include the Prawn Ceviche and Chicken Wings.\nAddress: 3A River Valley Road, #01-07, Clarke Quay, Singapore 179020\nOpening Hours:\nMonday-Sunday: 6pm-1am\nNassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar is tucked in Tanglin Post Office and is widely known for its freshest baked goods in the morning. Admittedly, not many F&B spots can take on as much as three different identities and do well. We are not sure how Nassim Hill has managed to do it all these years but hats off to them for that!\nThey serve scrumptious meals and relaxed vibes fill the joint all day long. From ultimate wholesome meals to unique all-day cocktails round the clock, its no wonder this place is a hit amongst the ladies! A laid-back atmosphere and enticing smell of freshly baked goods linger through the morning and afternoon air. As soon as the sun starts setting, Nassim Hill puts its magic to work and transforms itself into a charming bar and bistro serving up quality Western fare with American and European influences.\nCall up your gal pals on Wednesday and Thursday nights and get together for a two-hour free flow of Belstar Prosecco and Rose. The Yuzu Breeze is a blend of Prosecco, triple sec, yuzu and soda water. Makes for a refreshing cocktail with a slightly bitter aftertaste from the yuzu. If you prefer something stronger, do consider the Raspberry Lychee Iced Tea - a product of absolut elyx vodka, ice tea, fresh raspberries and lychees.\nTip: Get a jug to share around and save extra bucks while at it!\nAs we all know by now, the bread at Nassim Hill Bakery is freshly baked every day in-store and accompanies many of their signature dishes. One of their many best-sellers includes the Guinness Stout bread, made by reducing all the alcohol from a stout beer and leaving the flavours to rest deep within the bread.\nThe Hot Reuben is one of the dishes to feature their signature Guinness stout bread. Savour strong yet rich flavours bouncing off your tastebuds from the corned beef, melted Emmental, sauerkraut, onions and Russian dressing sandwiched between the Guinness stout bread.\nIf you want to make sure to keep your calorie count at check, do give the Asian BBQ Salad a try. A big bowl filled with garden-fresh greens and thick slices of grilled chicken and many other vegetables. The ginger and soy dressing adds on an oriental twist to an otherwise boring salad.\nTrust us when we say it\u2019s not easy to come across an eatery as versatile as Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar. Pop in for a drink from as early as 8am for their happy hour, get some filling brunch cravings fixed, have dinner alongside a glass of cocktail and buy some of their fresh loaves home.

            "Bali\nicon-chevron-right\nNightlife in Bali: 12 best places to party\nNightlife in Bali: 12 best places to party\nFrom luxe pool clubs to multi-level dancefloors, nightlife in Bali will delight you in many ways\nPHOTOGRAPH: AsiaTravel / Shutterstock.com BALI\nThis destination in Indonesia embraces its warm weather so nightlife in Bali kicks in a little earlier in the day than what you're probably used to.\nOnce you've figured out where to stay , you'll find luxe pool clubs dotted around the island where you can kick back on day beds and dip in and out of salt water pools before the lights get lower and things tick over into nightlife mode. Excellent restaurants and bars also embrace the party vibes after sundown, transforming from dining destinations into dancefloors when the kitchen closes. After a day well-spent at the beach or exploring other things to do on the island, head to these spots that combine a top-notch soundtrack with excellent vibes, great drinks and dancefloor antics.\nBest nightlife in Bali\nPotato Head Beach Club\nPotato Head Beach Club\nWhat is it? This beachfront pool bar is one of Bali\u2019s best day clubs \u2013 there are private daybeds, excellent cocktails (make sure you order the fresh lemongrass and passionfruit Kookaburra), restaurants and amazing views.\nWhy go? While the pool is the big drawcard, Potato Head is also a bit of a cultural hub. Expect anything from sculptural installations by art activist Liina Klauss; a DJ set by Floating Points; artworks by local painter Eko Nugroho; or the annual Sunny Side Up Festival (which has been headlined by the likes of Phoenix, Halsey and Flight Facilities).\nMotel Mexicola\nMotel Mexicola\nWhat is it? A colourful Mexican party bar and restaurant in the centre of Seminyak.\nWhy go? Settle in for a feast of empanadas, tostadas and tacos before working it all off on the impromptu nightly dancefloor. Bartenders will pour tequila laybacks to get the party started, and a soundtrack of reggaeton and Latin hits, plus classic party tracks will keep you grooving into the evening.\nLa Favela\nWhat is it? An eclectic indoor-outdoor garden bar in downtown Seminyak.\nWhy go? While you can head here early on in the evening for a sit-down dinner, La Flavela really cranks into gear after 10pm. Dinner tables are replaced by DJ decks, with local and international DJs spinning party tunes until 3am.\nWhat is it? A multi-level balcony bar in Uluwatu.\nWhy go? The sunset views from Single Fin are legendary, with the spot being a go-to for surfers and locals alike. Watch the waves roll in while you\u2019re perched on one of the biggest balconies in Bali with a rum-spiked kombucha or a white wine sangria in hand.\nOld Man's\nOld Man's\nWhat is it? Canggu\u2019s beachfront bar hosts international live music talent and a great mid-week party.\nWhy go? Even though the vibes are seriously relaxed at this Canggu bar, they score great international talent on a regular basis. You may catch a chilled acoustic blues set by Ash Grunwald one weekend, followed by a scratch heavy set from DJ Jazzy Jeff the next. Hump day is also a big drawcard here, with the weekly Dirty Ol\u2019 Wednesday party dishing out beer pong and plenty of ice cold margaritas.\n6\nDeus\nDeus\nWhat is it? This motorcycle juggernaut is behind one of the coolest hot spots in Bali, dubbed the Temple of Enthusiasm.\nWhy go? You can go full throttle at this workshop-meets-nightspot, with beers in the courtyard, DJs on the decks, rotating art and photography exhibitions, pop-up tattoo artists and more.\nWoobar Bali\nWoo Bar\nWhat is it? The glitzy poolside lounge bar in Seminyak\u2019s W Hotel.\nWhy go? There are loads of bars tucked away in Bali\u2019s five-star hotels, but Woo Bar is the one worth seeking out. Go for the daily two-for-one cocktail happy hour from 4-6pm, and sip on passionfruit mojitos underneath lantern lights and swaying palm trees. Head inside to the underground bar Woobase for thumping techno and house music.\nRock Bar\nRock Bar\nWhat is it? A world class cocktail bar that juts out off Jimbaran\u2019s rocky coastline 14 metres above the crashing ocean.\nWhy go? This swish spot is located within the Ayana Resort and is all about offering a refined and seriously picturesque drinking experience. Aside from the panoramic views of the Indian Ocean, the bar also does tapas-style eats, and DJs spin records from a booth that\u2019s carved directly into the cliff face.\nLa Plancha\nLa Plancha\nWhat is it? A bar on Seminyak\u2019s main beach with rainbow beach umbrellas to relax on and cocktail jugs aplenty.\nWhy go? This chiringuito-style bar was one of the first on the beach, and its glowing lights, colourful facade and inclusive vibes keep it one of Seminyak\u2019s most popular. You\u2019ll also find DJ sets with live saxophone accompaniments and tropical cocktails.\nPretty Poison\nWhat is it? An outdoor dive bar that takes cues from Californian skate culture, complete with a Lords of Dogtown-inspired skate pool.\nWhy go? A little entertainment never goes astray with a beer in hand, and local skaters here are more than happy to put on quite the show. Gather around the skate bowl\u2019s edge and watch locals glide, flip and spin in and out while DJs spin rock\u2019n\u2019roll records.\nSky Garden\nWhat is it? A sprawling multi-level club in the centre of Kuta.\nWhy go? Much of Kuta\u2019s nightlife is a drawcard for the wrong reasons, but if you\u2019re really set on going clubbing then do it here. It\u2019s the biggest nightclub in Bali with different levels that play house, RnB and techno over a good soundsystem.\nThings to do\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "By Jakarta100bars \u2192\nNote: I updated this Bali nightlife review in October 2019. I removed the nightclubs that have closed down like Jenja or Pyramid and I added the Vault, Lost City, and Red Ruby.\nI just stayed in Bali for a month and I visited all the happening nightclubs and bars from Kuta to Canggu.\nThe venues I chose on this list are the busiest and most happening spots for partying. They are not ranked in a particular order as each of them targets a different crowd.\nIf you don't know where to start your night out, I generally recommend the following:\n\u2192 Kuta : Go there if you are a basic tourist who wants crowded clubs with mainstream music\n\u2192 Seminyak : Go there if you want more sophisticated and expensive venues\n\u2192 Canggu : Go there if you are young or if you are staying in Bali for a few months on a budget\nBest Hotels Near Bali Nightclubs\nI recommend you to choose a hotel near a nightclub. You'll avoid 4 things: Drunk motorbike accidents, bag snatchers, traffic jams and crooked taxi drivers.\nHere are some highly-rated and affordable hotels that are walking distance from nightclubs:\nBest Nightclubs in Bali\nWhere is it?\nMore a bar than a nightclub, La Favela is located in the heart of Seminyak, on Jalan Oberoi. It is just in front of Red Carpet Champagne Bar, and next to Le Bistro.\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nThe interior design of La Favela is really amazing, a real work of art. The place is rather big, with a nice, quieter outdoor area. Trendy, hippie kind of crowd.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nThe music is a hit or miss, usually old-school with popular pop and disco songs. Not a sleek, modern place as it is made almost entirely from recycled materials and antiques. Popular with Westerners, much less with Indonesians. They give you plastic cups instead of real glasses.\nWhen is the best time to go?\nLa Favela is open all day as it is also a restaurant. The place becomes lively only after 11pm, almost any night of the week. Expect huge crowd on weekends.\nSkyGarden : Most famous nightlife spot in Kuta (Temporarily closed)\nWhere is it?\nSky Garden is located in Jalan Legian, Kuta. The street is often clogged with traffic so it's best to walk if you don't stay too far away. Beware of pickpockets outside and inside, especially at the end of the night.\nWho goes there?\nAustralians (50% Bogans), teenagers and backpackers from all over the world, Javanese prostitutes, 20-something Jakartans on their first trip to Bali, some younger expats.\nWhy should I go?\nThe biggest club in Bali with a fun, mixed crowd in terms of age and nationalities. Different music on every floor and room (electro, old school, RnB, live) including a rooftop and a huge main dancefloor with the best sound system in Bali (SkyDome). Some great shows including sexy dancers. Girls can get free selected cocktails on ladies' nights. Every day, cheap 5$ all-you-can-eat barbecue. Drinks are very reasonably priced.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nIf you don't like college style parties, then you will hate it. There are also quite many prostitutes operating in the club but they are rather discreet. You may also not feel too safe as it is just a few hundred meters away from Ground Zero where the first Bali bomb went off. Many expats hate it because it is too mainstream and because it attracts quite many singlet-wearing Australians.\nWhen is the best time to visit?\nBecause it is always packed early in the night, SkyGarden is recommended any day of the week, after 9pm. Complete review: Sky Garden Kuta .\nNote: Skygarden has been temporarily closed in August 2019 by Balinese authorities. It is supposed to be only temporary.\nWhere is it?\nIn the open-air, Old Man's has a great location right on Batu Bolong Beach in Canggu.\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nIf you stay in Canggu, Old Man's is where everyone meets. It is busy almost all day long, first with surfers, then with sunset-watchers, and finally party-goers. It's a good place to meet Western girls in their 20s.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nProbably overrated now. It used to be trendy, but now it's pretty much like SkyGarden in terms of crowd. Also, the food is bad and the music is commercial.\nWhen is the best time to visit?\nIt's best around sunset time.\nShishi : Newest Club in Seminyak\nWhere is it?\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nTrendy spot, good crowd, good food and music. Two rooms with different music (RnB/Techno).\nWhy should I avoid it?\nMore expensive than elsewhere, a bit pretentious.\nWhen is the best time to visit?\nYou can go there late as it stays open after 4AM.\nVault : Underground Club in Canggu\nWhere is it?\nIn the village of Canggu, on a spot surrounded by rice fields.\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nNewest nightclub in Bali with underground style. Good music, including house and Rn'B.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nNot sophisticated, no holiday vibe.\nWhen is the best time to visit?\nIt's more of a late spot so you can go there after 2 AM. It only opens on Friday and Saturday for now.\nWhere is it?\nRed Ruby is located on Jalan Petitenget, in the heart of Seminyak. It is not far from W Hotel or Potato Head Beach Club.\nWho goes there?\nSingle male expats above 30 (from Bali and Jakarta), Javanese girls (among which many working girls), some gays, some Western girls, some tourists.\nWhy should I go?\nIntimate club with many regulars. Great electronic music. Drinks not too expensive. A relatively easy pick-up place for guys and girls.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nIt is a closed air-conditioned club that has no \"Balinese\" or holiday feel. Western girls might not be comfortable with the number of prostitutes.\nWhen is the best time to go?\nI would only advise going on weekends or when they have special DJs. 1AM is the perfect hour.\nMirror : Best nightclub for Jakartans\nWhere is it?\nMirror is located in the back of Gardin Bistro on Jalan Petitenget, Seminyak.\nWho goes there?\nThe latest trendy club in Bali, Mirror attracts mostly people from the Seminyak expat community. Since the owner of the club is also behind the popular Fable in Jakarta, you also have a lot of Jakartans.\nWhy should I go?\nUnique d\u00e9cor, good crowd, full on weekends. They have also been bringing some famous DJs. People tend to dress up more than usual in Mirror.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nMainstream electronic dance music. The club is made to look like a church. Personally, I don't like it, it feels creepy. Others say it's a Harry Potter theme, which is even worse.\nWhen is the best time to go?\nThere are events from Wednesday to Saturday. You can go starting at midnight. More info: Mirror Bali .\nWhere is it?\nBoshe VIP is in Kuta on Jalan Bypass Ngurah Rai. You will need a 10-minute taxi ride to reach it from Jalan Legian and 20 minutes from Seminyak.\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nMost people go to Boshe for the girls. They have some sexy lady companions and a popular karaoke. The events are usually quite fun: They have rather good local live bands and an excellent sound system. After the live music, you usually have a DJ playing electronic music. There is a really cool dressing code for the staff: All of them have dyed hair, tattoos and a rock attitude.\nWhy should I avoid it?\nBoshe is almost 100% Asian. Guys usually book a table or a sofa, pay for some girls to accompany them, and get drunk. There are not many interactions between people. It is harder to meet a \"normal\" girl too. The live bands play a lot of Indonesian songs which can be boring if you are not familiar with them.\nWhen I should visit it?\nBoshe is decently crowded during the week, and it is busy from Wednesday to Saturday night. If you want to hear live music, come from 8am to midnight.\nWhere is it?\nEcho Beach, Canggu\nWho goes there?\nWhy should I go?\nWhy should I avoid it?\nNothing really special, I don't think it will stay open for a long time.\nWhen I should visit it?\nI recommend their Vice nights on Thursday when it stays open until 4AM.\nCLOSED NIGHTCLUBS:\nWhere is it? Pyramid is on Jalan Dewi Sri, easy to reach from both Seminyak and Kuta (10-minute ride by taxi). The area is one of the worst in Bali regarding safety. There have been countless reports of motorbike riders (females mostly) having their handbags snatched. Be very careful.\nWho goes there? People usually go to Pyramid after all the other places (Jenja, Mirror, Mint, SkyGarden, etc) have closed. It is a mix of different crowds, but mostly you will find male expats and prostitutes.\nWhy should I go? The electronic music is usually excellent. Past a certain hour, it is the only decent place opened apart from DeeJay Cafe (see below).\nWhy should I avoid it? You may not like the 80% male crowd, 15% prostitutes, 5% normal girls.\nWhen is the best time to go? I would only advise Pyramid on weekends as most of their events are on Friday and Saturday nights. 4AM is a normal time. Complete review here: Pyramid Bali .\nHu'u Bar $$$: (CLOSED)\nWhere is it? Hu'u bar is centrally located in Seminyak, Jalan Petitenget, near the new Alila Hotel. It is 2 minutes away from Ku De Ta or Potato Head.\nWho goes there? Mostly Indonesians from Jakarta and Indonesian residents of Bali. The rest is 25% expats and 15% tourists.\nWhy should I go? Hu'u has a Bali vibe with its large garden and swimming pool. Good crowd and one of the best pick up places on the island.\nWhy should I avoid it? The music is mainstream unless they have events. Since the opening of Mirror, it is not as happening as it used to be.\nWhen is the best time to go? Weekends only, midnight. For a complete review: Hu'u Bar .\nUpdate 2016: Hu'u has closed and it has been replaced by Gatsby (which is not so crowded). Jakartans now go to Mirror.\nHypnotized $$: Best club for under 25\nWhere is it? Hypnotized and the Velvet Lounge, also called VH, are located in Beachwalk Mall in Kuta. Easy to find, but the traffic can be horrible on weekend nights. Some taxis may actually refuse to take you there and will drop you instead at Kartika Plaza (10 minutes walk).\nWho goes there? The picture is misleading as most clients of Hypnotized are Indonesians living in Bali (but not Balinese). You also have some tourists from Jakarta and other countries.\nWhy should I go? Hypnotized is a rather clean club with less prostitution compared to other venues mentioned in this review. Guys looking to meet normal Indonesian girls could try it.\nWhy I should avoid it? Mainstream music. Younger crowd.\nWhat is the best time to go? Weekends only unless they have special events or guest DJs. It starts to fill up around midnight. More information: Velvet Hypnotized Bali .\nAkasaka / A-Club $$: Best underground club in Bali (CLOSED)\nWhere is it? Akasaka and A-Club are both in the same complex, in Denpasar, on the Simpan Enam roundabout. Every taxis will know where it is. If you don't have a taxi, you just have to follow Jalan Imam Bonjol from Sunset Road, then Jalan Teuku Umar. It is a 15 minutes drive from Sunset Road.\nWho goes there? Mostly Indonesians, Balinese and Javanese living in Bali. There are also some long term expats who are used to Jakarta nightclubs. 95% of the girls in Akasaka are prostitutes, freelance or not.\nWhy should I go? Akasaka is the most popular nightclub in Bali with Indonesians. It is also one of the craziest and at the centre of Bali prostitution scene: It's the only place in Bali where I have seen nude striptease. They have some good events with DJs from Jakarta and even international ones.\nWhy should I avoid it?: As a typical underground place, you have a lot of drugs including ecstasy. Very limited chances of meeting a normal girl. The techno music played in the largest room can only be understood by Indonesian ears.\nWhen is the best time to go?: Read more: Akasaka Bali .\n11) DeeJay Club $$ CLOSED\nPhoto Credit: Paradiso Hotel\nWhere is it? DeeJay Caf\u00e9 is located in Kuta, in Paradiso Hotel. It is not far from Discovery Plaza Mall on Jalan Kartika.\nWho goes there? Though not a gay club, I would say that most of the crowd is made of gays or ladyboys. The guys to girls ration is terrible, probably 10 to 1, and most girls are prostitutes. There are always some foreigners, usually expats, but most people are Indonesians.\nWhy should I go? DeeJay Caf\u00e9 is one of the only two after-hour club in Bali (with Pyramid) so you don't have much choice. The music is rather good, in general hits by famous Jakarta DJs (Bobby in particular).\nWhy should I avoid it? You should always avoid DeeJay caf\u00e9 unless you are too drunk or too high to make smart decisions. You may also not want to pay the entrance fee (from Rp100,000 to Rp200,000). A lot of drug inside.\nWhen is the best time to go? Saturday and Sunday morning after 5AM until 10AM. More information: Bali DeeJay Club .\nKoh $$ (CLOSED)\nWhere is it? The newest club in Bali, Koh is on Jalan Dyana Pura, Seminyak. It is not far from the gay nightlife area.\nWho goes there? Expats and Bali residents 70%, tourists 30%.\nWhy should I go? The main reason to go to Koh is for the music, which promises to be on par with nightclubs in Europe.\nWhy should I avoid it? Underground clubs in Europe are popular because you can take ecstasy safely. I'm not sure the safe concept would work in Bali if people are just drunk on beer.\nWhen should you go there: For now, weekends only, 1AM. Check if they have special events for the other nights of the week: Koh Bali .\nUpdate 2016 on Koh: It's good only if you go during events, if a famous DJs is visiting. Check their schedule before visiting to avoid being in an empty club.\nUpdate 2017: Koh has closed down since March. It might reopen later but it is not sure.\nJenja $$$ (CLOSED)\nWhere is it? Jenja is located in the basement of the Town Square Suites on Jalan Nakula. It is just between Kuta and Seminyak and 3 minutes away from Double Six beach. There have been several cases of robberies in front of the hotel so be careful late at night.\nWho goes there? Expats 60%, tourists 20%, Indonesians 20% (among which some prostitutes)\nWhy should I go? Jenja is popular for having the right dosage between chic and underground. Good resident and guest DJs. European-style electronic music.\nWhy should I avoid it? You might feel claustrophobic on the dancefloor as the ceiling is pretty low and the club packed at peak hours.\nWhen is the best time to go? Every night from Wednesday to Saturday, after 1AM. Read more: Jenja .\nPost Tags:\nPeople are flying to bali for good reasons.\n- Mint sucks now, all the expats have moved to Jenja.\n- Speaking of Jenja, the music is great and so is the crowd. Many many single white guys in their 40s and few legit girls. Sometimes you feel like being in a gay club.\n- Skygarden: It hasn't changed much. The rooftop is pretty cool and you'll even meet a few expats there.\n- Huu Bar is closed for renovation until the end of 2016.\n- Hypnotized gets an young Indonesian crowd.\n- Akasaka and Dee Jay is for drug users.\n- Koh is good only if they have a special event.\n- Bosche as per description above.\nI found clubbing in Bali to be \"Wierd\" do to the influx of tourists (many the drunken unsophisticated kind) and expats, who consistently outnumbered the locals in these places. This is a far cry from Jakarta which i consider to be far superior in a number of respects-it was wierd hearing the dominant language as English in these places instead of Indo. I visited a few of these places last week and here are my impressions:\nSkygarden: Dress code is SSS (shorts, singlets, and sandals) crowd. Hence i didn't fit in with my pants, dress shoes and button down shirt in rooms full of drunk, uneducated Bogans. Very efficiently run, good variety of music, international DJs, but the crowd is just too much of a \"spring break\" party drunk crowd for more sophisticated people. I believe nearly every Indo girl there is a Javanese Pro, and most could be found near the front entrance standing or gathered around a table. One visit was more than enough for me here.\nJenja: Underground, chic, more classier venue, but still feels a bit wierd and off to me. No Boganwear dress code, keeps those drunkard party goers on the Kuta side. Crowd sas mostly full of Expats in their 20s-40s, with not too many ladies - any less and i would call it a sausage party but not quite. Couldn't tell if the Indo gals there were Pro's or locals. Seems like a place where people partied in groups anyways, so not a great place to meet and hookup with strangers. Wouldn't plan to return.\nLaFavella: Venue was an interesting mix of rainforest, hippie, and recycled goods. Crowd again was mostly expats, some tourists, and some locals. More laid back crowd than Jenja, ages 20-30ish. OK place just to grab a drink, possibly a random hookup as well. Music was your average pop top 40 etc...\nA-Club/Akasaka: Bali's version of Golden Crown in Jakarta, only smaller, and a little harder to get to. Has everything else as its big brother though, Girls, Girls, XTC, annoying touts and doormen, Lady companions, Dugem headbanging music, little to no Bule's, Ripoff Taxi Mafia outside waiting to chop your wallet to take you home. A little slice of North Jakarta in the heart of Denpasar.\nA few comments:\nTrack 9 is now closed but will re-open soon as Eden.\nLa Favela was my favorite place to go but these days on weekends at least it is just too crowded.  As you mentioned, a queue  at the door then jam packed inside.  Weeknights are not so bad.  Bummer they raised the price of a mixed drink (in a plastic cup) from 100k to 125k.\nJenja Urbanized on Wednesdays is awesome.  Great crowd and not too packed.  Really good Hip hop.\nI was able to visit Bali late June for around 10 days and managed to visit a lot of the clubs here and a few new openings and give a small update and some observations of what the nightlife scene. The following clubs have closed down: Akasaka, Shanghai Baby, Koh so I did not visit. below are some new openings:\nThe Electrik - This is the reborn Mint nightclub on Jalan Petitenget. During the week it is a casual lounge and then a nightclub on the weekend. The design inside is industrial with some materials used from the old Koh Nightclub space on Jl. Dhyana Pura. The center bar has been removed which opens up more dancing space and you have also have lounges on the sides for table service. On Friday you have various events with house music and on Saturday you have a weekly night with Koh which are known for Techno & Tech House music with regular internationals DJ's visiting. I was able to visit three times during my stay and the place was very busy all nights I went there. Entry idr100,000/150,000 inc. 1 drink depending on event. Drinks pricing was also very reasonable. A great edition to Bali nightlife for those who prefer to listen to harder underground music. Hopefully they will have more success than the old Koh did.\nMrs Sippy - This place is the hot new \"beach\" club opening for High Season even though it is not located with beach front or view. Sandwiched in between the luxury Alila Hotel and Potatohead the venue has a huge pool, day beds, tables, a fake sand beach and the big novelty - a 5m high diving platform into its own dedicated dive pool. Already very popular with both Tourists and Indonesians you will struggle to find a free bed or table on weekends. They have a very popular Sunday Session with DJ's playing through till late and also a new Saturday night swim session with DJ playing. Opened by Australian's the food menu has your normal western pub/cafe food but strangely no Indonesian food options. Drinks pricing was simliar to other beach clubs. I would recommend coming here for the great atmosphere and also to enjoy the pool which is huge if your own hotel has none or a small pool.\nCabina - New little cafe, bar and pool just opened in June close to Batu Belig Beach. Only small but a good spot to enjoy some afternoon drinks if you stay close by. They also have DJ's playing in the afternoons if you want to catch some good sunset beats. We stopped by once and the food and drinks were good but it is a bit out of the way if you are staying in central Seminyak.\nDa Maria - is a huge new Italian restaurant next to Metis on Jl. Petitenget. After dinner the place is turned into a mini nightclub with DJ's spinning from 10pm. Worth checking out especially on the weekends when it gets busy. I tried for dinner (excellent) on a Thursday and stayed for the music after and was quite happening.\nSome of the other places I visited:\nThe classic beachclubs - Ku De Ta, Potatohead & Finns are all still as busy and expensive as you would expect especially at sunset.\nJenja - Still the hottest club in Bali for me. I visited on a Wednesday for the Urban/Hip Hop night and they had an international DJ playing, the place was packed out and great mix of Expats and Indonesians. I also visited on a Saturday and was also busy\nLa Favela - Visited on a Saturday and Sunday night. Super crowded both nights and struggled to get to the bar. Worth a visit.\nOpivm - visited once around 1am on a Saturday night was dead. Pyramid - visited twice on weekends at 5am was dead.\nDJ Club - I visited twice both on Saturday nights and the club was noticeably more busy then on previous trips to Bali. The crowd was a mix of expats and locals but many more local groups then usual with most of the booths full maybe because of the closing Akasaka it is picking up. The music has barely changed in the 5 years I've been going still trance/techno with some occasional Stadium songs thrown in.\nWhere are the best pool parties with DJs in Bali ?\nPyramid Nightclub is now permanently closed. We tried to visit last month and no longer open. They shut down just before the Nyepi day of silence holiday early March and checking their social media pages have no updates since then.\nFor after hours clubbing around Seminyak you can try Opera \"The Party Theater\" nightclub which is the old space where Opium nightclub was located next to the gay bars on Dyana Pura. The club is still very similar to the old venue with some small renovations but the ownership has changed to new Indonesian owners and the opening hours have been extended to 07:00 on some weekdays and as late as 08:00 on weekends for special events. I was surprised with the very late hours as the area is quite busy with a lot of normal tourist hotels but I heard the new owners might have some connections with the old Deejay Club so perhaps they have \"negotiated\" with the Police for license to operate later.. You can also try Red Ruby on Jl. Petitenget next to Potato Head as they sometimes extend opening hours to as late as 6am on the weekends.\nPublish your personal ad on Jakarta100bars for FREE!

            "7 Must-Visit Clubs in Bali for the Ultimate Party/Nightlife Experience\nWhat\u2019s a trip to Bali if you don\u2019t hit at least two or three nightclubs during your stay? Sure, day clubs are great to get in some quality R&R over a cocktail or two, or even a bottle of ros\u00e9 as you soak up the sun and the beach vibes, but for what it\u2019s worth, it doesn\u2019t give you the same pulsating  feeling that a nightclub can.\nWhen the sun sets in Bali, the party animals come out to play (or shall we say, rave) and here\u2019s where these creatures of the night flock to to wreak havoc.\nFrom the extravagant, the gorgeous to the downright rustic, Bali offers a rich mix of nightclubs that stay open until late. Here is our guide to Bali\u2019s 7 best day and night clubs.\n1. Club Jenja \u2013 A Sleek, Spacious & Sexy Club\nOne of the hottest clubs in Bali right now, Jenja is one that you should definitely hit up.

Be sure not leave too early because once the tables are shifted and the DJ deck is brought out, that\u2019s when the real party begins.\nAddress: Jalan Laksamana Oboroi No.177X, Seminyak, Kuta, Kabupaten Badung, Bali 80561, Indonesia\nOpening Hours: 5PM \u2013 3AM (Mon to Fri), 5PM \u2013 12AM (Sat), 12PM \u2013 3PM, 5PM \u2013\u00a03AM (Sun)\nContact: +62 818-0210-0010\nGiven the club\u2019s prominence and popularity in the Kuta district, many have compared it to the likes of Zouk Singapore.

            "Destinations\nLocations\nTokyo has some of the world's best nightclubs | \u00a9 oneinchpunch / Shutterstock\nKnown as a city that never sleeps, Tokyo fully embraces the moniker with a huge selection of brilliant nightclubs, some of which are open until 6am. Whether you\u2019re looking for a laid-back spot to discover new music or somewhere to enjoy a big night out, Tokyo has it all.\nDiscover underground DJs at Contact\nNightclub, Pub Grub, $$$\nAdd to Plan\nLocated in the heart of the constantly buzzing Shibuya neighbourhood is one of Tokyo\u2019s most revered and impressive clubs. With an excellent sound system and a clientele who are reliably up for a good time, it\u2019s clear why the likes of Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Nicolas Jaar and Giorgio Moroder have rolled through Contact\u2019s doors in recent times. The main room features a very strict no-drinks, no-cameras policy, and the venue tends to attract the more discerning techno and dance music fan. The entrance is hidden back from the city\u2019s main streets, and to gain access to the venue, visitors must register online to become a member, but once you get through the doors of Contact you\u2019ll agree the effort is worth it.\nMore Info\nAdd to Plan\nRoppongi is well known as Tokyo\u2019s ultimate clubbing suburb, and one of the area\u2019s most popular nightspots is A-Life. It\u2019s spread over three floors, and the music here is all about unpretentious, good old-fashioned fun \u2013 think cheesy bangers and top-40 hits. The venue also offers great value for money , with three drinks for \u00a51,000 (\u00a37) before 11pm.\nMore Info\nBar, Japanese\nAdd to Plan\nWant an alternative to the commercial music played at many Tokyo bars? Located underneath the hustle and bustle of Shibuya is The Room, a small basement where you can listen to jazz, soul and R&B tunes. Although it\u2019s small in size compared to your average Tokyo nightclub, The Room\u2019s great selection of music and relaxed atmosphere make up for it. This is the spot to be if you\u2019re looking for a low-key evening spent sipping on whiskey with good company.\nSep 10, 2018 at 12:27am PDT\nMore Info\nBar, Pub Grub, Japanese\nAdd to Plan\nOriginally located along a hidden pathway, Oath moved its location to Shibuya\u2019s Trump Room in 2018, an underground club that has long been popular among trendy young Tokyo fashionistas. A tiny black door leads you into a room decked with chandeliers, lamps, mirrors and even a stuffed deer, creating an elegant and opulent interior. Oath hosts some of the world\u2019s best underground DJs and serves high-quality drinks; the doors stay open until 8am on Saturdays and Sundays, meaning it\u2019s the ideal place to go for a nijikai (after-party).\nMore Info\nNightclub, Food Court, Pub Grub\nAdd to Plan\nWith multiple dance floors, a roster of the biggest names on the electronic music scene, waterfront views and even a pool on the balcony, AgeHa is the best place to go for a big night out in Tokyo. Because it\u2019s so large, the club is actually located a little out of the city in Shin-Kiba, but there are free shuttle buses to and from Shibuya all night long. Once you get here, though, leaving will be the last thing on your mind.\nMore Info\nNightclub, Cocktails, Beer\nAdd to Plan\nArty Farty is a great place to stumble into after a few boozy drinks in the Shinjuku Ni-ch\u014dme area, Tokyo\u2019s LGBTQ hub. The popular dance club always has a fun and welcoming crowd, the menu is foreigner-friendly and the drinks are reasonably priced. A cover charge of \u00a52,500 (\u00a317) provides guests with one drink once inside and allows you to come and leave as you please, meaning you can hop back and forth to the club from nearby bars. The entrance fee also gives you access to their sister club, The Annex, which is located nearby.\nMore Info\nNightclub, Cocktails, Beer, Wine, $$$\nAdd to Plan\nBar Bridge is like no other club in Tokyo, delivering a wide range of music from jazz and hip-hop to cheesy music from the 1980s, all pumped through their top-grade sound system. Located only a minute away from Shibuya station, the club has an impressive view of the famous Shibuya crossing and features a number of resident DJs who rotate throughout the week. Some of Tokyo\u2019s top DJs play here from time to time, and the venue attracts a diverse crowd, from college graduates to businesspeople reliving their disco days.\nMore Info\nNightclub, Cocktails, Beer, Wine\nAdd to Plan\nThis nightclub franchise, which originally opened its doors in Manchester, UK, has locations worldwide and has now opened an outpost in Tokyo. Occupying the top two floors of Q-Plaza, Sankeys Penthouse overlooks Harajuku\u2019s colourful and busy streets . Grab a drink in the casual bar area and dance the night away on the 10th floor, or go upstairs and sit on an almost-too-comfortable couch to chat with friends. With tall ceilings and a terrace, the top floor replicates a fancy hotel bar, making it the perfect place for a sophisticated night on the town.\nMore Info\nNightclub, Pub Grub, $$$\nAdd to Plan\nHaving opened its doors in 1997, this Shibuya institution still has a reputation for being the best hip-hop club, not only in Tokyo, but in the whole of Japan . Booking both local and international DJs and performers, the venue is as diverse as the music is loud \u2013 and it\u2019s really loud. Harlem is also a great place in Tokyo for witnessing up-and-coming Japanese hip-hop stars cut their teeth and learn the tricks of the trade before taking over the Japanese hip-hop charts.\nMore Info\nNightclub, Cocktails, Beer, Wine\nAdd to Plan\nGinza is Tokyo\u2019s most popular shopping district, featuring high-end brands and numerous department stores. But among all the glitz and glamour is one of the city\u2019s hottest nightclubs, PLUSTOKYO, which opened its doors in November 2018.

Continue into several rooms and hallways decorated with modern art pieces and neon signs, a punk-themed VIP room and another room illuminated with pink-hued lighting, all of which combine to make PlusTokyo the perfect playground for art aficionados. This venue has hosted several popular DJs already, including Steve Aoki and Alice Wonderland.\nMore Info\n"

            "Picture | September 10th, 2019 | Dayna Hannah\nShare:\nA night on the town in Tokyo is an experience unlike any other. New York might be the city that never sleeps, but Tokyo doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the word! Whether you\u2019re looking for a quiet dive, a groovy nightclub, or an elegant cocktail bar, you\u2019re guaranteed to find something that tickles your fancy.\nEvery district in Tokyo has a distinctive atmosphere, which gives it a large and diverse nightlife scene. To help you get started on planning, we present our quick guide to traveling around Tokyo at night. Below, you\u2019ll find out more about the flavors of each neighborhood, and how to spend your evening.\nTHE BEST NIGHTLIFE AREAS IN TOKYO\nThe Tokyo Metro is one of the most convenient public transportation systems in the world, but it doesn\u2019t run 24 hours. Most train and subway lines suspend service from midnight to 4:00 am. In some areas of Tokyo, you might have to resign yourself to waiting in a cafe or checking into a capsule hotel. That is, unless, you happen to be in one of these areas.\nShinjuku: Tokyo\u2019s Red Light District\nDay or night, Shinjuku is always buzzing with people. Heading out of the Kabukicho Exit, there are four main places to enjoy your time. Along the skinny alleys of Omoide Yokocho, you\u2019ll find a collection of ramshackle watering holes that can fit less than ten people inside.\nA fifteen-minute walk from here takes you to Golden Gai, where you can quietly drink inside of historic post-war era buildings. If you\u2019re looking for something more lively, head to Kabukicho or Shinjuku 2 Choume.\nThe infamous Shinjuku Kabukicho street is Japan\u2019s largest red-light district. Home to over 3,000 entertainment businesses, including the Robot Restaurant and love hotels, it\u2019s worth exploring but keep your wits about you. The Yakuza (Japanese mafia) own a few locations here!\nYou can find a similar vibe near Shinjuku 2 Choume (pronounced Nii-Cho-May), which is Tokyo\u2019s small but bustling gay district. Dragon Men and Arty Farty are the go-to dance clubs, and drag queens serve you at Campy Bar.\nShibuya: Where to Find Rocking Clubs and the Best Bars in Tokyo\nUnder Shibuya\u2019s neon lights, the streets fill with echoes of laughter from gaggles of young Tokyoites looking for their next haunt. With so many options for bars, clubs, arcades, and more, Shibuya is one of the best districts to party in if you miss the last train.\nTravelers love seeing the Hachiko statue, scrambling through Shibuya crossing, and shopping in fashionable boutiques. The local establishments are very accessible if you don\u2019t speak Japanese . Even the smallest hole-in-the-walls have English menus and sometimes English-speaking staff.\nOn any given weekend, you can find clubs featuring local and international DJs playing a variety of genres. The stylish Contact features multiple dance floors and mostly spins techno and house. If you\u2019re looking for a little more genre variety, check out WWW X, which brings together pop, alternative, and EDM under one roof.\nRoppongi: Where You\u2019ll Find the Best Nightclubs in Tokyo\nIn the post-war era, government officials from Allied forces lived in Roppongi, and several businesses began to pop up to offer them leisure activities. Nearly a century later, and Roppongi is the most famous entertainment district in Japan, attracting locals, expats, and travelers alike.\nRoppongi is a hodgepodge of glitzy nightclubs, jazz venues, art museums, and a fair share of seedy places. On the same night, you could enjoy contemporary works by Japan\u2019s foremost artists at the Mori Art Museum and stumble into a dive serving a few grizzled characters.\nOn the top floor of the Roppongi Roa Building, the club V2 Tokyo has one of the hottest dance floors and offers a view of Tokyo\u2019s skyline. If you want a homier experience, try the Two Dogs Taproom which has 24 craft beers on tap and an all-you-can-drink option. For something a little more refined, check out Motown House, which has a relaxing atmosphere and plays your favorite (you guessed it) Motown hits until morning.\nGinza: Spending Your Tokyo Night in Style\nGinza is well-known for its department stores and Kabuki theater , but at night, you won\u2019t find crowds thumping along the pavement. Most of this neighborhood\u2019s nightlife takes place on the upper-floors of seemingly conventional buildings. Behind nondescript doors, you\u2019ll find some of the most exclusive bars and clubs in Tokyo catering to an affluent clientele.\nMany of these stylish places like Ginza Tender and Orchard, serve classy and inventive cocktails. Genius is Tokyo\u2019s most luxurious club with an open floor plan and private lounge areas. If you\u2019re looking for somewhere a little easier on the wallet, you can bar hop along Ginza Corridor. Here, you\u2019ll find festive pubs and restaurants along one long street.\nTokyo Off the Beaten Path: Spots in Tokyo that the Locals Love\nAlthough markedly different in reputation, Ginza, Roppongi, Shibuya, and Shinjuku all have one thing in common\u2014travelers love these areas! If it\u2019s your first time in Japan , you don\u2019t want to miss seeing these places at least once. However, if you love finding \u201chidden gems,\u201d try branching out into other neighborhoods.\nSurrounding most major-to-medium sized stations, you\u2019ll have no problem finding restaurants, karaoke joints, and quintessentially Japanese-style pubs. These days, young and trendy Tokyoites prefer areas like Kichijoji, which is consistently rated as the most desirable neighborhood to live. Anime and manga lovers are migrating away from Akihabara to Nakano Broadway. Meanwhile, hipsters and independent music lovers spend their time in Shimo-Kitazawa.\nTHINGS TO DO IN TOKYO AT NIGHT\nYou can make your night out in Tokyo an immersive Japanese experience by going to these types of places!\nIzakaya: Drinking in Traditional Japanese-style\nJapanese izakayas don\u2019t look, smell, or feel anything like a pub you\u2019ve been to before. Specific layouts depend on each shop, but you\u2019re likely to find places where you take off your shoes and sip sake on tatami floors in private rooms. People love these places not just for the decor, but also for the prices. Most traditional Japanese pubs offer all-you-can-drink and all-you-can-eat plans.\nTachinomi: Standing-only Bars\nDrinking in a bar that doesn\u2019t have any chairs might not sound appealing at first, but believe us when we say you\u2019re going to have an excellent time! At a tachinomi, the pours are stiff and budget-friendly , making them the perfect place to either start your night or stop by while you plan your next destination. Not to mention, since you\u2019ll be standing so close to the other patrons, you\u2019ll quickly strike up conversations with new friends.\nHigh Rise Bars: Drink in the View of Tokyo\nIf dashing around every noisy nightclub isn\u2019t your idea of a good time, you can leave the streets behind\u2014by several stories! In the swankier parts of Tokyo, you can find high-rise hotels with chic bars and large windows. As soft music plays in the background, you\u2019ll take in the city view and relax with a highball or a glass of Japanese whisky.\nKaraoke: Belt Your Favorite Tunes in Privacy\nIf you never liked singing in front of strangers, Japan is the country for you! Most karaoke places feature private booths for you and your group. You can also order drinks and snacks to your room to keep the party going.\nRamen: How to End Your Tokyo Night\nIf you\u2019ve spent your evening trying all of the essential cultural experiences, don\u2019t forget to end it that way with a piping hot bowl of ramen . For Japanese people, nothing closes out a night on the town better than slurping down some oily noodles. Although it isn\u2019t the healthiest snack when you already have a belly full of beer, your tongue will thank you for it!\nTHINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU PARTY IN TOKYO\nJapan is one of the safest countries in the world for foreign travelers, but it isn\u2019t without its share of crime. Although rare, there are some reports of establishments scamming people, especially tourists, out of their money.\nIn the most notorious scheme, employees stand outside of a business trying to attract customers. If you go inside, you might find yourself paying an extravagant bill riddled with hidden fees.\nNot all clubs and restaurants advertising their menus outside are running rackets. To be safe, though, it's better to avoid these places unless you know the area very well. Besides, if they need to work hard to drive up foot traffic, it generally means the food and drinks aren\u2019t tasty. However, if you find an otoshi (\u304a\u901a\u3057) charge on your check, don\u2019t call the police.\nIn many izakayas and tachinomis, the waitstaff will bring a small snack with your first drink. This is an otoshi appetizer, which costs around 200-500 JPY (about US $2.00-5.00). You can\u2019t refuse it, the server won\u2019t explain it, and you have to pay for it even if you don't eat it.\nThink of the otoshi as a cover charge. Even though it might not seem like a fair deal, it\u2019s a great way to try traditional Japanese food !\nFOOD & DRINKS | Specialty\nPicture | March 20th, 2020 | Dayna Hannah\nVisiting a neko (cat) cafe or an animal cafe in Japan is the purrfect way to add some fun to ......\nANIME | Recommendations\nPicture | March 12th, 2020 | Dayna Hannah\nIf you like Akihabara, then you\u2019re going to love Den Den Town in Osaka.......\nPicture | March 11th, 2020 | Dayna Hannah\nIf you\u2019re planning to take a summer vacation in Japan, you\u2019re in for a real treat.......\nYour Email Address\nEmail *\nSign-up\nHaving a hard time finding a tour, please check our Group Tours Calender:\n2.

With so much to do in Korea's capital after sundown, they argued, hitting the pillow could only be a waste of time. For Seoul is a new world at night: as its glittering lights pop on to hail the onset of evening, a whole other urban landscape awakes where shining shopping malls, steamy saunas, and lively clubs and bars can be enjoyed round the clock. Relish the refreshing breeze while cycling along the riverbanks at night, and when hunger calls, enjoy a generous and delicious late night meal.

            "Seoul is one of the craziest cities for a good night out! In this article I featured the top night clubs you must visit in Seoul and which ones you should avoid.\nViews: 67873\nWhen: Best time to visit is fall (September & October)\nTip: Korean clubs are open until the early morning, do not go clubbing prior to 12am. Stay in the bar district Hongdae before making your way to Gangnam on the last train.\nThe nightlife in Seoul is vibrant and full of energy. I visited the best nightclub in Korea which has been ranked in the world's top 20.\nPlaces\n1. Club Octagon\nThe most popular nightclub in Seoul & Korea - many famous DJs have played here\n2. Club Ellui\n3. Club Cocoon\nNot as great as No. 1 and 2 but still good for a fun night out - the Koreans here go absolutely crazy\nI arrived in Seoul on Saturday evening and headed straight to the best nightclub in Korea located in the Gangnam district (from the Gangnam style song) after dropping off my bags in Hongdae .\nCocoon nightclub in Hongdae, Seoul on a Tuesday night\nClub Octagon is currently #12 on the world's best nightclub list by DJMag100 . Octagon attracted many famous DJ's over the last year, even Hardstyle DJ Headhunterz which is pretty rare in my opinion.\nOctagon has a good balance of girls and guys. It even has an open concept kitchen where you can order top quality dishes until the morning hours.\ntequila shots and OB beer with Team Kazahkstan\nNotable DJs playing at Octagon were Roxy June from Thailand (check her soundcloud ) and Pascal Dior from Germany.\nI had so much fun at Octagon that I forgot to check out Ellui which is another popular club and #39 on the world list.\nthe most spicy after party food EVER! but delicious\nDuring the week I checked out bars and clubs in the Hongdae district. Cocoon was one of the better places in Hongdae and is always packed no matter what day of the week primarily with university dudes (sausage alert!).\nIt is also funny that Hongdae is swamped with a bar chain called Ho-Bar . You can find them all over the district ranging from Ho-Bar 1, Ho-Bar IV till Ho-Bar 10.\nI've made a lot of new friends in Seoul and I hope to be able to return to this place again in the near future.\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share!\n"

If you\u2019re unlucky enough to be rejected, move on to one of the many other clubs in the area.\nIf you can read Korean, use NAVER or Kakao Maps to navigate to your club \u2013 it\u2019s much more accurate than Google Maps there!\n\u2013 Gangnam \u2013\nPSY might have put this name on the map, but you\u2019ll have to head down to experience Gangnam for yourself. Known to have more upscale bars and clubs, Gangnam is a must-visit if you\u2019re in Seoul to party.\n1. Octagon \u2013 best club in Korea which comes with swimming pool\nEssentially the Zouk of Korea, Octagon is hailed as the best club in town, and ranked among the top 5 in the world. No Seoul clubbing experience is complete without a visit here, and if you had to pick one club to visit, this is easily it.\nView from the main stage\nThrow any plans to club hop right out the window \u2018cuz this club has got 2 storeys, 3 bars, private mezzanine VIP bunkers and even a swimming pool to explore all through the night.\nAs a testament to its popularity among locals and foreigners alike, the queues here can get pretty long so make sure to head down a little earlier to account for queue time.\nCover charge: KRW30,000 (~S$35.70)\nOpening hours: Thu-Sun 10PM-6AM | Closed on Mon-Wed\nTelephone: +82 10-9031-0808\n2. Arena \u2013 popular among celebrities\nIf you\u2019d like to spot K-pop idols IRL, Arena is likely your best bet in this list. It\u2019s known to have been host to lots of celebrities so keep your eyes peeled.\nThe music here is usually EDM, progressive house and\u00a0 hip hop\nImage credit: ARENA\nThe main downside is that the club has a reputation for rejecting entry to foreigners \u2013 make sure to have a Plan B just in case.\nCover charge: KRW20,000 (~S$23.10)\nOpening hours: Thu 11.30PM-9.30AM | Fri & Sat 11AM-11.30AM | Sun 11.30PM-9.30AM | Closed on Mon-Wed\nTelephone: +82 10-2025-0885\nWith a capacity for 1,000 people, Club Mass is one of the bigger clubs in Seoul. The party joint is spread across 2 basement levels, and the main stage hosts both Korean and international DJs.\nCover charge: Sun \u2013 Thu KRW10,000\u00a0 (~S$11.60) | Fri \u2013 Sat KRW20,000 (~S$23.10)\nAddress: 1306-8 Seocho 4(sa)-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul\nOpening hours: 10PM-10AM, Daily\nLocated right next to Hongik University, Hongdae is a lively area by night with buskers filling the streets and bars and clubs opening up their doors. This is also an ideal district for club hopping as there\u2019s a high concentration of clubs within walking distance from each other.\n4. M2 \u2013 opens till as late as 8AM\nHip hop might be thriving in clubs these days but for those who still love a good EDM remix, head to M2 to party the night away with your buds.\nThis 1,000-capacity club has been around for more than 15 years, and is still a local favourite till date.\nThe party\u2019s still lit at 4AM during the weekend\nAddress: 20-5 Jandari-ro, Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea\nOpening hours: Tue \u2013 Thu & Sun 10PM-6AM | Fri-Sat 10PM-8AM\nTelephone: +82 2-3143-7573\n5. Cocoon \u2013 themed parties\nOne of the largest clubs along the streets of Hongdae is Cocoon. Nights here are hardly ever the same as the club constantly plans different themed parties. Past events include Hit Song Party and Masquerade Party where chart toppers were played and fancy masks were given out respectively.\nElectronic and hip hop music is also often heard here to keep the party going till sunrise. This club closes at 6.30AM, so if you manage to stay till the end, you\u2019ll be able to take public transport back to your hotel .\nCover charge: KRW10,000 (~S$11.60) on weekdays | KRW20,000 (~S$23.10) weekends\nAddress: Wausan-ro 21-gil, Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea\nOpening hours: 9PM-6.30AM, Daily\n6. Noise Basement 2 \u2013 free entry before 10PM\nAsk a local to recommend a club in Hongdae and you\u2019d likely get Noise Basement 2, or NB2, a local-favourite owned by YG entertainment. DJs here often play hip hop and K-pop remixes, great for dancing the night away with.\nAside from just entry to NB2, party goers can also look forward to free entry into NB1 and Harlem with the same wristband \u2013 but take note that the other two are only open on the weekends!\nNeon-light covered entrance\nCover charge: Weekdays KRW10,000(~S$11.60) | Weekends KRW15,000 (~S$17.30)\nAddress: 72 Wausan-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul 04067, South Korea\nOpening hours: 9.00PM-6.00AM, Daily\nTelephone: +82 10-8541-1278\nPro-tip: Taxi rates in Seoul are similar to Singapore, but there have been many instances of scams . Make sure to ask the driver to turn on the meter before heading off!\n7. CLUB VERA \u2013 underground club that hosts celeb showcases and fan meets\nCLUB VERA is a cosy underground club round a corner in Hongdae. Electro house and commercial music are most commonly heard here. On days the space isn\u2019t used as a club, events like celebrity showcases and fan meets are held here as well.\nDuring my visit, I lost the locker key, which came on an elastic waistband. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did \u2018cuz you\u2019ll end up having to communicate to the non-English speaking staff through Google Translate, with loud music in the background. There\u2019s also a fine of ~S$50 for losing keys.\nOther than that it was a dandy night.\nCover charge: Weekdays KRW10,000 (~S$11.60) | Weekends 20,000 (~S$23.30)\nAddress: South Korea, Seoul, Mapo-gu, Seogyo-dong, 356-1 B2\nOpening hours: Wed \u2013 Sun 10PM-7AM | Closed on Mon & Tue\nItaewon is a popular party destination among foreigners and you\u2019ll find plenty of travellers and expats here, compared to the rest of Seoul. Clubbers here tend to be a bit older than in Hongdae, and are also a friendlier bunch.\n8. Cakeshop \u2013 grungy space in a warehouse\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, Cakeshop does not actually sell cakes. What it does have in store though, is a sweet party. Taking the spot of an old illegal strip club, this underground club has a grungy, ghetto aesthetic with red neon lights marking it\u2019s entrance and graffiti decorating the club\u2019s cement walls.\nThe club is a relatively small one, with a capacity for 200 people, and always has a constant stream of people waiting in line to enter. There\u2019s no specific music style here but some of their genres include Disco, Hip Hop and R&B.\nImage credit: Cakeshop Seoul\nCover charge: KRW10,000-20,000\u00a0 (~S$11.60-23.10)\nOpening hours: Thu \u2013 Sat 10PM-5AM | Closed on Sun \u2013 Wed\nHardcore clubbers will have come across many different types of clubs, but one with a soap bar as a logo is likely not one of them. Soap Seoul is a quirky club with a soap icon right behind the DJ\u2019s booth, and glowing luminescent blue light filling the space.\nInternational guest DJs sometimes come down to play in this club as well. Stay tuned to this page to catch the monthly lineup.\nAlso, just soju know, drinks here also rather affordable, averaging KRW8,000 (~S$9.20).\nCover charge: KRW20,000 (~S$23.10)\nOpening hours: Thu \u2013 Sat 10PM-5AM | Closed on Sun-Wed\nBoombar is an upscale and more intimate club decked in fancy chandeliers and velvet couches. Despite the atas interior, the dress codes don\u2019t seem to be any stricter than the regular Korean club. DJs here typically spin hip hop and R&B music.\nTelephone: +82 2-792-8898\nNightlife in Seoul\nNightlife in Korea is absolutely exhilarating, and expectedly so, since it\u2019s such a huge part of the local culture. If you\u2019ve somehow managed to party your way through these top 10, there\u2019s a seemingly endless list of other clubs in the city waiting, all also offering cheap drinks and relatively affordable cover charge too.\nLadies take note that guys there can be quite aggressive with their approach, but other than that, the city is pretty safe for partying.\nMore things to do in Korea:\nTrending\n8 hours ago\n1 day ago\n1 day ago\n2 days ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2020 TheSmartLocal.com\n2948\nSHARES\n"

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\nThe best new bars in Singapore to have a drink at in the city\nThe best new bars in Singapore to have a drink at in the city\nThe drinking scene in Singapore is the best, bar none. We check out new cocktail bars, craft beer joints and more\nSingapore's bar scene has blossomed tremendously in the past couple of years. Not only do we have some of the best bars in Asia , we\u00a0also have plenty of local talent flying our flag high and big overseas names landing on our shores with exciting new concepts.\nWe take a look at some of the new bar openings in town, including one inspired by the colourful neighbourhood of Little India, a\u00a0juicery that moonlights as a fruity cocktail watering hole, and more.\nBrought to you by the same people behind now-defunct 21Moonstone, Moonstone Bar is a reincarnation of the original establishment that aimed to create a space that juggles work and play. The new joint on Amoy Street aims to be a 'Modern Community Centre', a place for people to gather over food, events and conversations. For drinks, expect tipples such as the Liang Teh Cocktail, a combination of gula Melaka, Fernet Branca and a rotation of gin infusions, which could be anything from chrysanthemum to luohan guo. Not into cocktails? It also has Guinness Draught on tap.\nLocated at Tanglin Mall, along the fringes of Orchard Road, Metta is a quiet new spot where you can sip on its range of whiskies and gin from a comfortable long leather banquette. More than just a relaxing space to unwind, it also offers bespoke cocktails and bar bites.\nRaffles Place\nLooking for a chill place to have a pint around the CBD? Hopstation is a new craft beer bar located near popular drinking holes around Club Street and Amoy Street. There are 13 beers on tap, offering pilsners, IPAs and stouts from Belgium, Australia, the UK and US and more at an average of $14 per glass. It also has a large range of craft beers available by bottle \u2013 including brands like Discow Macaw from Taiwan and Hitachino Nest White Ale from Japan.\nChinatown\nYou might not have heard about this bar that opened up quietly along the Keong Saik stretch about three months ago. No Sleep Club is a day-to-night concept that sells coffee, tasty grub and excellent cocktails. It's run by\u00a0Juan Yi Jun and Jessica Hutch, both industry veterans who have worked at the likes of Operation Dagger and Proof and Company respectively. Expect the unexpected with tipples like Hay and Apples ($22), a combination of toasted hay scotch and fermented apples as well as Tom Yum and Melon ($23), a sweet and mildly spicy mix of carbonated honeydew with a Thai herb distillate.\nOutram\nSaying goodbye is never easy. Late last year, the Jigger & Pony Group shut down Flagship in its three-concept shophouse to the dismay of Old Fashioned purists everywhere. And it\u2019s twisting the knife in deeper by replacing it with a bar worlds apart from its grungy, divey past. Live Twice is a complete metamorphism of the space. There are 14 drinks on the menu, with the first half inspired by classics you\u2019d find in a Japanese craft cocktail bar and the latter named after geisha \u2013 hinting at the drink's individual personality and flair.\nIts location in three historic shophouses reflects the same storied inspiration of Barbary Coast. On its first floor is Deadfall, a relaxed, laid-back watering hole that was common in the early 1800s. Toast to cocktails concocted based on colour ($14), or a selection of beer (from $6) and wine ($12) \u2013 all while you kick back and relax in a warm, rustic space accentuated with wooden beams, exposed brick walls, and upcycled shipping pallets. On the second floor at the Ballroom, you'll find mismatched floral wallpaper and expertly crafted cocktails.\nRaffles Place\nThe most famous bar in the world \u2013 so famous it even has a movie about it \u2013 finally opens doors at Singapore's buzzy nightlife destination: Clarke Quay. The Coyote Ugly Saloon is decked with the\u00a0hallmark saloon doors,\u00a0signature graffiti murals of Calavera Day of the Dead skills, marquee lights that spell out the legendary bar's name, and of course, the resident Coyotes who are ready to welcome patrons with their sizzling dance moves. Indulge in everything from the classic and Coyote-exclusive cocktails ($22-$24) to shots, premium spirits, wines and champagne.\nChinatown\nYugnes Susela, the former head bartender behind Smoke & Mirrors, is the brains behind The Elephant Room. For his freshman menu, he\u2019s set his sights on Singapore\u2019s Little India. The seven drinks are named after iconic sites of the area like Tekka, Jothi\u2019s Flower Shop and Buffalo Road. The first is the bar\u2019s signature tipple, a tribute to the heart and soul of the community \u2013 the food centre and wet market that residents count on for nourishment. Tekka ($22) blends Old Monk rum with coconut and lacto-fermented bananas. The Buffalo Road ($22) is another winner, combining pink guava-infused gin with vetiver and tonic that makes for a herbaceous G&T.\nBars and pubs, Cocktail bars\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Dave says, Don't leave Bangkok without\u00a0seeing a sunset from the top of the Moon Bar.\u201d\nSukhumvit stretches on forever, actually running all the way out along Bangkok's eastern seaboard, but the real action takes place from lower to mid Sukhumvit, basically between soi's 1-55, encompassing the Nana, Asok, and Thong Lor districts (for Ekkamai and Thong Lor nightlife, see our separate pages on this, as this guide covers Sukhumvit proper). While the area is noted for its infamous Nana Plaza and Soi Cowboy red light area, those not looking for adult pleasures can have an excellent night out at plenty of other drinking and dancing venues. Soi 11 has become famed for its bar life, ranging from the\u00a0upscale Above Eleven , and current top dance nightclub Levels, the hideaway retro-Cuban Havana Social Club , as well as the groovy live music bar Apoteka . The range here is endless. Craft beer lovers will want to head for the tiny Bottles of Beer , while for something more sophisticated, you can have a 360 degree panorama at the chilled out sky-high Octave Bar , check out a unique stage show at the upscale Sing Sing Theater , get up above the crowds at the centrally located sky lounge Axis & Spin , or you can hang out in frozen splendor at the Titanium Club and Ice Bar , which also rocks the night away. One thing is for sure, you will have all your happy hours taken care of along Sukhumvit with an endless array of possibilities.\nPhoto courtesy of Titanium Club\nTitanium is a happening and pulsating place to check out some live music and totally chill, literally that is. The lavish club features innovative lighting, a big sound system, celebrity DJs, and Thailand's hottest all-female rock band that performs here regularly. Additionally, the club boasts a -10 ice bar in which frozen drinks are as cold as the surroundings. The ice bar has every known brand of vodka on the planet in its collection and makes a unique addition to the club. The big draw though is the Unicorn all-girl rock band that performs nightly and really sizzles. It isn't exactly cheap here, but the club is indeed a flashy spot to rock the night away.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For an icy hot club, Titanium rocks and is pretty unique.\nDave's expert tip: There is a buy one get one free vodka drink happy hour before 10 pm.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For some superb cocktails and warm vibe, inVite is an excellent selection.\nDave's expert tip: Check their Facebook page to find the latest promos and specials.\nAs the name says, Apoteka seeks to emulate a 19th-century apothecary, with plenty of old wood and brick and lots of potion looking glass bottles up on the shelves. The retro feel is in here, but the scene is very modern. Not only does the bar have some great signature cocktails and a wide variety of beer and wine to select from, but the happening bar on trendy Soi 11 is also home to some of Bangkok's best live music. The Keith Nolan Blues Band, one of Bangkok's finest blues outfits, are regulars, as is the popular Soi Dog Blues Band. If you appreciate good blues, this is the best you are going to find on this side of town. In a street that has become noted for its trance, DJ, and full-on electro-style parties, Apoteka feels a bit more refined and elegant and is an excellent choice for a night out.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For a combo of great live music, stiff drinks, and a hip atmosphere, Apoteka stands out.\nDave's expert tip: From 5:30 - 8:30 pm they do a 99 baht happy hour here with house spirits and beers going for cheap. It's a bit far to walk here from Sukhumvit. Take the Sky Train to Nana, walk over to Soi 11, and grab a motorcycle taxi down the soi.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For a birds-eye view of Bangkok and chilled vibe, you can't beat Axis & Spin.\nDave's expert tip: Take advantage of the happy hour promotions from 5-8, such as buy one get one free. Check the Continent website for updates.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: Octave has the best panorama view of Bangkok anywhere on Sukhumvit and is a real sky-high cocktail bar.\nDave's expert tip: Sunset is a great time to come in. Best to get here by taking the BTS Skytrain to Thong Lor and walking over one block.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For Sukhumvit's most happening spot, it is hard to top Levels.\nDave's expert tip: Check the website for theme and promotion nights, along with the listing of which top DJ's will be in town.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For being Bangkok's most unique highbrow dance club, Sing Sing Theater is a work of art!\nDave's expert tip: Take the BTS to the Phrom Phong station and walk over to Soi 45, the club is next to Quince Restaurant.\nThis hole in the wall pub has more space for beer than customers, but that is just fine, as their selection of bottles of craft beer and cider from around the world is simply outstanding. You sit around a long rectangular table, gape at the fridges and shelves full of both Thai and international crafts, and save your money by ordering six or more (which can be combined between friends), which gives you wholesale prices, pretty much unheard of in Bangkok. Added pluses are the owner's most well-behaved chihuahua in the world, which makes the rounds to all drinkers, and the roast chicken vendor outside, who brings in rotisserie grilled chicken once you've worked up an appetite.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For a vast selection of craft beers set in a friendly local spot, Bottles of Beer is your neighborhood go to!\nDave's expert tip: Take the BTS Skytrain to the Thonglor station and walk back down Sukhumvit to Soi 34, the bar is just down the street on your right.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For chilled out nightlife with great drinks, Above Eleven is on top.\nDave's expert tip: Gents need not wear singlets, shorts, and sandals, there is a casual dress code\nHavana Social is Sukhumvit's ode to Cuba. While the other bars on happening Soi 11 are open-air or street-facing clubs, Havana Social is a hidden secret. It is down a side alley, has no sign, and there is no indication that there is even an establishment here. There is just an old retro telephone booth outside. Call the bar in advance to get the entry code, which you punch into the payphone, a door swings open, and voila, you enter a crumbling shophouse that resembles pre-revolution Havana, complete with cracked ceilings, hanging clotheslines, and retro furniture straight out of Fidel's younger days. In truth, it's origins, there are great mojitos and rum drinks on the menu, and even Cuban dancing and a live band on weekends. It's a great escape from the often seedy Soi 11 experience, and well themed, fairly authentic, and a great Bangkok party haunt.\nRecommended for Sukhumvit's Best Nightlife because: For a unique party in a retro-Cuban hideaway, Havana Social excels.\nDave's expert tip: The club is in the little alleyway in front of the Fraser Suites. Look for the old payphone booth out front, and make sure to contact them before for the code to get in.\nMeet Dave Stamboulis\nDave Stamboulis is a travel writer/photographer based in Bangkok. Born in Athens, Greece and growing up in the U.S., Dave first discovered Bangkok while on a 45,000-kilometer bicycle trip and... More About Dave\n"

Located at 109 Beach Road, this mall boasts an impressive selection of cheap cameras and other electronics. Learn the art of haggling and you\u2019d definitely be able to leave the mall with a steal. Don\u2019t believe us? Visit Funan the next time you need to get a new gadget for yourself!\nSim Lim Square\nImage: todayonline.com\nOne of the go to malls for cheap computer parts and laptops, this mall is like your typical fish market, except that they sell electronic gadgets instead of fishes. Located on 1 Rochor Canal Road, Sim Lim Square is one of the oldest and biggest electronic stores in Singapore and has great bargains for anything from computer parts to the latest laptops, digital cameras, DSLRs, PlayStations, Xboxes and mobile phone accessories. However, a word of caution: this mall has also gained a reputation for cheating due to shady businesses operating within, and we won\u2019t advise the electronics novice to venture into its depths.\nIf you are really interested in buying from the mall (who could resist? It\u2019s cheap leh!), do your research well beforehand or get a friend who\u2019s a level 99 in electronics to accompany on your shopping trip. You won\u2019t regret it, trust us!\nLucky Plaza\nImage: skyscrapercity.com\nLocated on 304 Orchard Road, this mall is packed to the brim with hordes of electronics and gadgets shops. However, you\u2019d only be able to get a good deal if you\u2019re able to haggle with the best of them, and they\u2019ve been haggling with customers there for decades! Always go 60-70% lower than the owner\u2019s initial bid and work your way up from there. Remember, be thick-skinned and you\u2019ll most likely walk out of there with a heavier wallet.\nMustafa\nImage: justgola.com\nIf we\u2019re talking about cheap and good, then we really cannot miss out Mustafa . Located at 145 Syed Alwi Road, this is one of the most popular malls for bargain hunters to go to when they\u2019re searching for a good deal.\nEven without bargaining, their initial price already undercuts most in Singapore and their salespersons are professional and don\u2019t mind removing the package for you to inspect the goods. And if you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s okay to say thanks and walk away. If you like it, you\u2019d have to pay and come back with the receipt before you can test the goods. And best of all, it\u2019s opened 24/7 so no need to rush to complete a purchase because the mall\u2019s closing for the day.\nChallenger\nImage: sharesinv.com\nChallenger is another famous electronics shop in Singapore. Located in malls across the island, we decided to put this in because they have a wide variety of electronic gadgets available for the average user, and their deals for their members are usually pretty snazzy.\nThe best thing is there\u2019s no card to present nor does the member have to show up, you can just give their NRIC number to enjoy the member\u2019s discounts as well. Either that or ask the next person in the queue if they are a member. They\u2019ll usually be more than willing to purchase the item on your behalf because they\u2019ll accumulate reward points too.\nPC Show, IT show, Sitex, Comex\nbudgethotel.sg\nWe understand that these shows are not considered shopping malls, but honestly, if you are on the hunt for good, cheap and amazing deals for electronics and gadgets, then these 4 shows that takes place annually is definitely a must-go for you.\nNot only are the prices attractive, they come with a slew of free gifts such as thumb drives, warranties etc that just makes you want to take out your card and shout here, here! Take it! Usually so crowded that it makes walking even a challenge, we\u2019d advise you to go on the last day near closing time because that\u2019s when the best deals are going to be offered.\nThere you have it!

            "10 Affordable Sneakers That Will Never Go Out of Style\nHighsnobiety / Asia Typek\nCollecting sneakers is a hobby\u00a0more popular now than ever before \u2013 but it can also be an expensive one.\u00a0The thinking goes, cool sneakers aren\u2019t cheap and cheap sneakers aren\u2019t cool, right? Not necessarily.\nNot everyone can afford to constantly pay upwards of $200 for the newest sneaker release, especially when there are multiple hyped silhouettes dropping on a weekly basis. However, getting your hands on\u00a0a good looking pair of\u00a0cheap sneakers is actually much easier than\u00a0most think. Gone are the days where customers have to spend vast amounts of money to look fly from the ground up.\nThat is why we\u2019ve put together the definitive guide to (relatively) cheap sneakers that we believe should be in every self-respecting sneakerhead\u2019s rotation.\u00a0While big name brands like Nike and adidas offer some very solid options, the likes of New Balance , PUMA , and Converse have also made the cut.\nSo, sit back, put your feet up, and scroll through our guide of cheap sneakers that will have you looking fresher than your budget might suggest.\nNike Air Force 1\nTitelmedia / Asia Typek\nThe fact that a true OG like the Nike Air Force 1 can still be picked up on the low makes all those Ls trying to cop the latest hyped sneaker a little more tolerable. If you don\u2019t already own a pair of all-white AF1s, you need to do yourself a favor and stock up. The best part\u00a0about choosing the Nike Air Force 1 life is\u00a0that you can find the\u00a0sneaker at\u00a0basically any retailer.\nAir Force 1 '07\nWhere to shop\nVans Old Skool\nTitelmedia / Thomas Welch\nThe Vans Old Skool is arguably the most trustworthy pair of affordable kicks on the market; it\u2019s a timeless silhouette that just seems to work with a variety of outfits. Most retailers stock\u00a0the low-top skate shoe, but there are also more than enough Vans stores that\u00a0should\u00a0have a full-size run. Made to skate in, you can put money on these lasting you longer than a regular pair of sneakers, saving you even more money over time.\nOG Old Skool\nTitelmedia / Asia Typek\nThe Air Force 1 is to Nike what the Stan Smith is to adidas. A classy, sleek silhouette that goes as well with a pair of black skinny jeans as it does with some colorful, summer-ready shorts. Like the AF1, it\u2019s\u00a0often available on sale at select retailers. If you\u2019re bad at making up your mind,\u00a0just know that the Stan Smith comes in many different colors and materials, meaning there should be\u00a0a pair for everyone\u2019s tastes and preferences.\n(On Sale)\nStan Smith\nTitolo\nBritish heritage in the form of a tried and trusted design for a fraction of the price of today\u2019s newer releases \u2013 what\u2019s not to like? Reebok\u00a0can sometimes be\u00a0underrated by sneakerheads,\u00a0but the Reebok Classic Club C 85 has withstood the test of time and, above all else, is an affordable alternative that shouldn\u2019t be passed upon.\nClassic Club C 85\nSamba Classic\nNew Balance\nNew Balance sneakers are known for their extraordinary comfort and high-quality construction. The\u00a0574 is no different, though it is a much sleeker model than\u00a0New Balance\u2019s other, at times, bulkier silhouettes. Available at very attractive price points, this sneaker is able to blend seamlessly with most outfits, which is not a bad thing.\n574 Core\nPuma\nThe PUMA Suede is a classic that can often be found at discounted rates and is a very solid option for the style and budget conscious individuals looking for a new pair for their rotation. While the black/white colorway has been a staple in rotations since the shoe dropped some 50 years ago, the PUMA Suede comes in a number of different colorways, making it both a versatile and an affordable sneaker choice.\nSuede Classic\nTitelmedia / Asia Typek\nThe ultimate low-top sneaker in black suede, the Converse One Star Skate is made for those of you who actually do skate on occasion. With more foxing in the toe and padding, the sneaker can take more of a beating than most other sneakers, which, when combined with its price of under $100, makes it a very attractive option for those on a shoestring budget.\nOne Star Skate\nTitolo\nThe Gazelle, the cousin of the adidas Samba, is as sleek as\u2026 well\u2026 a real-life gazelle. If you\u2019re sensing a pattern here it\u2019s because there is one. Lower price-point sneakers are often more minimalist and subdued than their more expensive counterparts. The adidas Originals Gazelle proves this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, with a versatile design that\u2019s easy on the eyes.\nGazelle\n$80\nadidas\nHighsnobiety / Asia Typek\nThough this New Balance\u00a0sneaker is above $100,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0timeless and worth\u00a0the investment for anyone scoping out a dadcore silhouette. Coming from the Made in US series, the 990v4 is (as the name suggests) entirely produced in the US of A, manufactured by New Balance\u2019s workers in its\u00a0New England factories. A true statement to American craftsmanship, these sneakers will stick with you long into their beater life phase.\n990v4 Made in US\nFor more about\u00a0classic sneakers, watch below.\nTo stay up to date with more Shopping content from Highsnobiety, follow @Highsnobietyshopping on Instagram and @Highsnobdrops on Twitter.\nOur designated shopping section features products that we love and want to share with you.

            "It\u2019s safe to say that with the exception of professional F1 drivers, nobody goes to Singapore to participate in extreme sports. The most extreme thing you can do here is blow your entire life savings on a night out, which isn\u2019t quite the same thing.\nWe may not exactly have gaping canyons, dank caves or towering waves, and Bukit Timah Hill may not exactly be Mount Everest. But thrill-seekers can still get their adrenaline levels up with these heart-stopping activities.\n10 extreme sports in Singapore that thrill-seekers love\nExtreme sport\n$12 to $18 per hour\nGo Kallang for rock climbing\n$29 for pass and equipment rental\nWakeboard at East Coast\nZipline at Megazip Adventure Park\n$50 (1 ride)\n$65 (2 rides)\n$159\nZoom around in a Super Car on the F1 route\nFrom $378\nSlacklining (free)\nSlacklining involves walking on a tightrope that\u2019s suspended between two posts. The great thing about slacklining is that anyone can buy a slackline and string it up between two trees, which makes it a great picnic or barbecue activity.\nWhen you get good enough, you\u2019ll be able to do tricks and jumps on the slackline.\nPrice: Free, but a starter slackline set costs $70 at Decathlon.\nView this post on Instagram\nNov 20, 2018 at 9:27pm PST\nSpeed skating ($18 for 2 hours)\nSingapore\u2019s tropical climate may not exactly be conducive to breeding the next Hans Brinker, but we\u2019re actually decent at speed skating. Perhaps this is a testament to the fast pace of life here.\nTo get started all you have to do is head to one of our local rinks at Jurong East or Kallang, strap on pair of skates and get going. If you\u2019re not an experienced skater, it\u2019s going to take some practice before you can attain high speeds.\nPrice: $18 for two hours of rink access at Jcube including rental of skates, $3.50 for subsequent 30 minutes.\nView this post on Instagram\nBounce at Amped Trampoline Park Singapore ($12 to $18 per hour)\nTrampolines aren\u2019t just for kids. For those who laugh in the face of danger, trampolining can be pushed to the extreme with gravity-defying jumps and somersaults in mid air. Be careful, though, as collisions with people and neck injuries can cramp your style.\nA number of trampoline parks have popped up around Singapore, with Amped being the most well-known. Basically, you\u2019ll be directed to a massive room that\u2019s covered in trampolines.\nIt\u2019s also a kid-friendly activity and there are kids-only Monday afternoon sessions if you prefer your kid to bounce only with size-appropriate companions.\nPrice: $12/hour on Mondays, $15/hour from Tuesday to Friday, $18/hour on weekends. You also need to buy a pair of grip socks for $3. Pricing is subject to change on public holidays and eve of public holidays.\nView this post on Instagram\nGo Kallang\u2019s\u00a0Climb Central for rock climbing ($29)\nDoes jumping off bridges with a rope attached to your ankles sound a bit anti-intellectual to you? Then you might want to try rock climbing, the thinking man\u2019s sport.\nRock climbing is an exercise in problem-solving, as you\u2019re essentially trying to pick out a path up a rock face that\u2019s viable for your body. Everyone\u2019s build and physical capacities are different, so what works for one person might not work for you.\nWhile indoor rock climbing may not be considered as extreme sports since even kids can do it, the sport only gets more extreme the better you get. Once you\u2019re a proficient climber, you can try traditional climbing in the great outdoors and explore natural rock faces.\nPrice: $22 for an adult day pass. You will also need to rent equipment for the day, a full set including shoes and harness costing $7.\nWakeboard or cable-ski at East Coast Park (from $32)\nOnce upon a time, going wakeboarding meant renting a boat in the deserted marshland that Punggol used to be. These days, ever since cable ski parks started popping up, wakeboarding has become a lot more accessible and affordable for extreme sports enthusiasts.\nEast Coast Park is one of the island\u2019s best-known wakeboarding hotspots thanks to Singapore Wake Park, which has its own cable ski system, meaning you won\u2019t have to rent a boat to pull you around. This also makes it one of the cheapest places to wakeboard in Singapore.\nThey also conduct classes if you\u2019re a newbie and want to pick up the basics.\nPrice: $32 for 1 hour, $42 for 2 hours. Rates include rental of life vest, helmet and wakeboard.\nView this post on Instagram\nGX-5 Extreme Swing or G-MAX Reverse Bungy ($45)\nYou don\u2019t have to go to Universal Studios to get your teeth rattled on a heart-stopping ride.\nGX-5 Extreme Swing, which is located at Clarke Quay and replaces the previous G-Max Reverse Bungy, will have you strapped into a seat which is then launched into the air while attached to elastic cords.\nAs it\u2019s located in a party district, it\u2019s also a favourite of friendly drunks. Five people can swing at once, so you won\u2019t have to scream alone.\nPrice: $45\nZipline at Megazip Adventure Park (from $50 per ride)\nWhether you see yourself as Tarzan or George of the Jungle, ziplining is a great way not only to get a bit of wind in your tummy, but also to enjoy Singapore\u2019s jungle landscapes without getting eaten alive by swarms of vengeful mosquitoes.\nYou\u2019ll be strapped into a harness before you zip over treetops, at heights of up to 75 metres and speeds of up to 60km per hour.\nPrice: $50 for one ride, $65 for two rides when you book online at the Sentosa Store.\nRead also:\u00a0Top 9 Sentosa Attractions: Where to Get Discounts and Promotions\nView this post on Instagram\nTry skydiving at iFly Sentosa Singapore (from $89)\nThe only way to legitimately skydive in Singapore is to join the RSAF. Since you probably don\u2019t want to do that, settle for a skydiving simulator at iFly Sentosa instead.\nThe simulator will have you suspended in mid-air thanks to air pressure in a wind tunnel, which is a sensation that\u2019s similar to the free-fall skydivers experience.\nPrice: For first timers, it costs $89 for one skydive, $119 for two. Book online at least two days in advance and pay only $109 for two skydives during peak hours, and $89 during off-peak hours.\nView this post on Instagram\nBungee jump at AJ Hackett Sentosa ($159)\nThere\u2019s no need to go all the way to New Zealand to bungee jump! Singapore now has its very own bungee jumping facility.\nBungee jumping is ideal for you if you can\u2019t be arsed to build up your skills in any particular sport and are just looking for an adrenaline rush. It\u2019s as easy as stepping off the edge of a cliff.\nPrice: $159. Includes one jump, a tshirt, an e-certificate, access to the Skybridge, as well as a membership that entitles you to 20% off AJ Hackett jumps anywhere in the world.\nView this post on Instagram\nZoom around in a Super Car on the F1 route ($378)\nFormula One has done more to put Singapore on the international map than any amount of Passion Made Possible ever will.\nWhether you\u2019re a diehard F1 fan or just want to drive on local roads without having to moonlight as a Grab driver, you can now drive a super car on the very same route that F1 drivers take each year.\nBook a supercar experience with Ultimate Drive, and before you know it you\u2019ll be flying past Marina Bay Sands in a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder or a Ferrari California, accompanied by a professional driver who\u2019ll ensure you don\u2019t wreck the car.\nPrice: $378 for a 15 minutes Street Circuit Tour, $580.50 for Street to Freeway tour, $783 for Ultimate Freeway Tour, $985.50 for Singapore Explorer.\nView this post on Instagram\nPersonal accident insurance that covers extreme sports\nKeen to try any of the above? Make sure that you are well-insured with a Personal Accident insurance policy that covers extreme sports . Take note that some personal accident insurance policies exclude\u00a0selected high-risk\u00a0activities.\nGenerally, sports that are open to the general public without restriction (aside to height), such as\u00a0rock climbing and sky diving, are included in most personal accident insurance plans.\u00a0However, do check before you go.\nHave you tried any of the above?

The resorts and hotels provide for rooms, food services and some of them also include certain water sport activities in their packages.\nDepending on the resort you decide to book and the package you avail, you may or may not have to pay for certain water sports separately.\nAn admission cost is usually incurred by those who visit the resorts but do not stay at it. They also have to pay for water sports in addition\nOn the other hand, there are water parks and centres that do not provide for stay and can be visited for a day-long adventure. Most of these parks, such as the Batam Wake Park, are open from morning to evening and provide for facilities, such as changing rooms, seating area and food and drinks on sale. Places, such as the Cable Ski Park also encourage prepaid bookings and packages where they include the ferry ride transfer to and from Singapore.\nPrecautions and Tips\nWater sporting is a great adventure activity that is for all ages. In fact, the range of excitement is most varied in the case of water sports. Where on one hand, there are the quiet boat rides, on the other, there is the exotic cable skiing or parasailing. Yet, safety gears and precautionary equipment is absolutely necessary for water sporting activities. This is because all the water sports have the danger of falling off into the water and a sudden fall without any safety equipment can be harmful if not always fatal.\nA few things to keep in mind would be:\nMake sure that you are always wearing a safety life jacket, no matter how experienced you are or how casual the sport may be, such as boating.\nCheck that the harnesses are strapped in the correct position during the different water sporting activities, such as cable skiing, wakeboarding, water skiing, parasailing and so on.\nA fall in the water during sports activity is common. The key is not to panic and get on the board or Jet Ski again.\nIt is advisable to know how to swim because it would be easier to manipulate yourself in water during a fall. However, most of the water sports can also be done without knowing swimming since members of the crew are always around. Make sure to inform your instructor if you do not know how to swim.\nFollow the guidance given by instructors. The instructions not only tell how to indulge in the sport but also, what to do on a fall. Also, if you are not too sure always let the crew members accompany you.\nIt is recommended to remove eyeglasses, watch or any jewellery while performing water sports, such as Jet Ski, water skiing and so on, because these may get lost if there is a fall.\nIt is best to avoid activities that you are inherently scared of. For example, avoid parasailing if you are extremely scared of heights.\nCheck the age limit of each sport. Most sports allow children above the age of 6, however, for advanced sports such as parasailing and cable skiing it is best to have children be able to communicate well in case of emergency.\nRead the release form that you might have to sign for certain water sports to know the risks and safety measures.\nWater sports are a fantastic adventure to undertake and one that is both safe and thoroughly exciting. Batam is one of the leading destinations to try the adrenaline rushing water sports and is well-known for its safety, equipment and instructors. If you are looking for an adventurous escapade into the waters, then Batam should be your next stop.\nThis post was published by\nShare this post on social media\nPlaces to visit in Batam\n9.0 (53 reviews)\nIDR 2,940,000 onwards\nGrands I Hotel\n8.9 (416 reviews)\nIDR 1,250,000 onwards\n8.8 (426 reviews)\nIDR 663,756 onwards\nSplendid Batam with Singapore and Bintan Island\n6 Nights\n7 Nights\n7 Nights\n5 Nights\n5 Nights\nDeals start \u20b91,898\n4.8 /5\n1162 ratings\nVIEW DEAL\nMajestic Fast Round Trip Ferry Tickets between Batam and Singapore (Harbourfront Terminal Departure)\nDeals start \u20b91,887\n14 Hrs Duration\nDeals start \u20b93,517\n14 Hrs Duration\nDeals start \u20b92,646\nDeals start \u20b92,025\nGet amazing deals on packages\nGet plans from destination experts\nGet Customized Travel Packages\n(+91)\nEcuador (+593)\nEgypt (+20)\nWe value your privacy.

            "We all know friends who are adrenaline junkies. Those who get kicks out of taking crazy risks and going on wild adventures all around the world. Heck, maybe you\u2019re thinking: That\u2019s me.\nWe all know how important travel insurance is, but if you\u2019re planning a ski trip, scuba diving trip or something even crazier than that, then you need to know what kind of travel insurance provides the best cover for adventure sports.\nHere are 6 things you need to pay attention to when buying any sort of adventure sports travel insurance .\n1. Know which activities are excluded from your travel insurance cover\nEven if your travel insurance plan is marketed as extreme sports travel insurance , there are still activities that no insurance company is willing to cover. Here are a few major examples:\nAny professional competitions or sports in which you get paid, sponsored or receive any kind of financial reward.\nExpeditions to inaccessible, remote or previously unexplored places.\nBeing the pilot or a crew member of an aircraft.\nNow, you might say that you\u2019re probably not going to do any of these things, but between companies, there are different standards as to what\u2019s allowed, so always check before you buy your travel insurance.\n2. Find out which activities exclude you from Personal Accident or Personal Liability Cover\nWhile some travel insurance seems to have a comprehensive coverage, you have to make sure that the activity that you are doing is covered under Personal Accident or Personal Liability.\nFor instance, AVIVA\u2019s travel insurance coverage claims that you\u2019ll be automatically covered for a whole list of leisure activities, as long as they\u2019re played on a recreational basis. It covers go-karting, jet skiing and surfing.\nFair enough.\n\u2026 Until you read the fine print. Then you\u2019d realise that these three activities, along with wind-surfing and water skiing, have no personal accident cover. You do enjoy personal liability cover though, which means any third party damage (people or property) will be covered up to $250,000.\nIn other words, if you get seriously injured during any of these activities, your travel insurance will not cover any medical costs. The irony? These are exactly the kind of activities where you\u2019re more likely to suffer an accident. So don\u2019t forget to check the fine print!\n3. Be aware of the special circumstances where activities are not covered\nSome activities will be covered by your travel insurance, but only if it\u2019s within a specific circumstance. Again, this is not being unrealistic. But it does mean you have to be careful that your activities don\u2019t exceed the boundaries set by your travel insurance. These are examples of some activities which aren\u2019t covered by your insurance:\nCanoeing or white water rafting without a qualified guide or Grade 4 and above (of the International Scale of River Difficulty).\nOff-piste skiing, or skiing outside the officially approved boundaries of a ski resort.\nMountaineering beyond the height of 3,000 metres above sea level.\nUnderwater activities involving artificial breathing apparatus for diving deeper than 30 metres.\nSo while some of these activities are covered by certain travel insurance policies, they do have limits to their coverage, so be careful to stay within the stipulated boundaries.\n4. Check if\u00a0you need to pay more for extra cover for adventurous activities\nDepending on the company, some firms require that you upgrade your travel insurance plan to include adventurous activities. Although it might seem unfair to incur a steep increase in the premium price, do note that most of the time, this increases your coverage for other categories within the same plan as well.\nFor MSIG\u2019s travel insurance plans , for example, the Standard Plan doesn\u2019t include activities like bungee jumping and skydiving, but the Elite Plan, which costs more, does. By paying the extra premium, your cover for personal accident and personal liability increases by 50%-100%. When you look at the big picture, that\u2019s not a bad deal.\n5. Look out for Sports Equipment Coverage\nIf you\u2019re a hardcore skier or diver, then this section should not be news for you. If you have your own sporting equipment that you intend to bring on the trip, you have to be aware how much your travel insurance is covering you. When your gear can cost a few hundred dollars, you\u2019ll definitely want to invest in a plan that will insure you don\u2019t lose out if your gear is stolen or damaged.\n6. Ensure you have sufficient Emergency Medical Evacuation cover\nThis is especially important if you\u2019re planning to go scuba diving, hiking or skydiving. Since you\u2019re most likely not going to be near any decent medical facilities should anything happen, you may need to get emergency medical evacuation. Check to make sure your travel insurance policy covers you sufficiently for such an occasion. Where possible, choose policies that can give you at least $500,000 cover for medical evacuation, even if you end up paying a little more.\nTravel insurance plans to consider\nThere is no one-size-fits-all, but these 3 travel insurance plans are generally quite suitable for adventure sports:\nFWD Premium\nTotal Premium\nSee a doctor online, enjoy cashless medical outpatient treatment in Singapore, access to emergency assistance and your travel policy documents through the FWD Flyer app!\nTotal Premium\nIf you\u2019re having trouble sourcing for and comparing different travel insurance packages, head on over to MoneySmart\u2019s Travel Insurance Comparison Page for quick and accessible information on the best insurance packages available.\nDo you have any other suggestions for getting the best travel insurance for adventurers?

            "Top 10 Best Diving Sites in Indonesia\nIndonesia is little known to divers out there that Indonesia is actually one of the world\u2019s best scuba destination even though it has many beautiful diving spots.\nIndonesia has one of the longest coastline in the world stretching from the Indian Ocean to the east and Pacific Ocean to the west. Being part of the Coral Triangle of the world, Indonesia has a diverse marine life with 20% of world\u2019s coral reefs. There are over 3000 fish species and 600 coral species to discover, where the dive sites come in diverse types from coral, steep walls, deep water trenches, wrecks and underwater volcanic mountains. To top it off, diving in Indonesia is affordable.\nThe best time and weather to dive in Indonesia are during the dry season of April to December. But it is generally alright to dive all year round in Indonesia.\nForming one corner of the \u2018Coral Triangle\u2019, the epicenter of world marine biodiversity, and containing 20% of the world\u2019s coral reefs, it will come as no surprise that it boasts the most diverse waters in the world.\nCorals at Raja Ampat, Papua. Photo by Lakshmi Sawitri\nRaja Ampat\nLocated just off the northwest tip of Papua (Irian Jaya), it is the most well-known dive site in Indonesia. Diving in Raja Ampat is one of the most talked-about activity in Indonesia travel. It is an archipelago of 1,500 small islands. The marine life diversity here is staggering with 1200 fish species, where a world record of 284 on a single dive in Kofiau Island was noted. Raja Ampat set itself apart from the rest of the world\u2019s dive site. It is even coined the term Frontier Diving, where diving will take you over crystal clear seas, inhabited islands with the horizon stretch out beyond into infinity. If you are lucky and in the season, you can even catch whale sharks while diving!\nTogian Islands\nDiving in Togian Islands are also among the top activities in Indonesia that many know besides Raja Ampat. Just located North of Sulawesi, Togian Islands are a group of islands boasting secrets to amazing dives. This place is still largely unexploited, invoking feelings of diving in unexplored places. One of the best diving places in Indonesia and maybe even on earth, you will have to explore more than the 3 dive sites among these 56 islands The two top places to stay on this island are Black Marlin Dive Resort * and Kadidiri Paradise * .\nKomodo Islands\nDiving at the Komodo islands is also known to many world-class divers. The Komodo National Park \u2019s reserve offers what every tropical diving paradise does \u2013 calm and colourful shallow reefs, mountains of marine life from reef fishes to sharks, and deep walls and pinnacles. Komodo Islands is the epicentre of scuba diving for its rich marine life and coral reefs. Besides, on land, it houses the famous Komodo dragon, which is the largest lizard in the world. The place to stay on this island itself is the Komodo Resort * .\nBunaken Islands\nOne of the top diving sites in Indonesia, Bunaken Island (Pulau Bunaken) is unsurprisingly very popular for divers around the world. The Bunaken Marine Park, located at the north tip of Sulawesi, is not only rich with marine lives, but it is also mesmerizing for its water so clear it is truly transparent. It has an amazing diverse marine life such as 70 different corals, five species of sea turtles, many fish species and even white tip and black tip reef sharks, the almost extinct dugongs, barracuda and even saltwater crocodiles! Bunaken island also features a world-class wall diving.\nBali Islands\nNo doubt there are reasons for Bali\u2019s popularity, not only was it one of the best places to surf in Indonesia, but it is also one of the best places to dive here. Many divers find this place with excellent shore-based diving surrounded with a view of magnificent volcanoes and lush rice paddy terraces. Scuba diving in Bali gives you deep drop-offs, steep banks, coral ridges and famous wrecks from the world war, volcanic outcrops and seagrass beds. Choices of dive sites here including Nusa Penida , Nusa Lembongan , Tulamben and Candi Dasa. Divers favourite resorts here are Penida Dive Resort (Nusa Penida), Twin Island Dive (Nusa Lembongan) and Toyabali Dive Resort * (Tulamben).\nJellyfish at Diving Raja Ampat, Papua. Photo by Lakshmi Sawitri\nJust neighbour to the famous Bali, this sister island Lombok keeps its own secrets to spectacular diving with untouched coral reefs and pinnacles.

You can also do a drift diving here with a negative entry and also descending pinnacles and giant granite rock formations that are clinging with beautiful corals.\nPulau Weh, Sumatra\nDiving in Pulau Weh is well known for its rich ecosystem and off the beaten track in oppose to its famous distant sister Bali of Indonesia. A part of this island had been declared as wildlife protection is by the Indonesian government because it is the home to many rare species on land wild the coral reefs are bursting with a large and diverse variety of Indo-Pacific marine life. The remoteness of this Island makes the open Banda Sea all the more fascinating to dive in as the place is still bursting with a vibrant and natural reef system and a large variety of marine life that are not exploited. Seemingly only good dive resort on this island is the aptly named Pulau Weh Dive Resort *\nWakatobi Islands\nDotted in the Banda Sea, the islands of Wakatobi \u2013 Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomea, and Binongki is another Indonesia\u2019s answer to world-class diving. Rich with reefs along with barriers, corals and fishes, this national park is well protected, thus brimming with healthy marine lives. Diving here will also contribute towards the local community and the support for the marine park. Relatively new in the diving scene of Indonesia, the place is still practically untouched.\nBanda Islands\nOne of the best-kept secrets of Indonesia, this little-known diving site of Indonesia is bursting with healthy reefs of massive hard corals, sea fans, sponges, and marine wildlife of pelagic and reef fishes. Diving Banda Islands might bring you into critter havens of Ambon and also other undiscovered secrets that only diving exploration can bring.\nRecommended tours *:\nAuthor: Rachel\nFascinated by Indonesia, Rachel hopes to bring the best Indonesia Travel Guide to independent travelers so that they can enjoy what Indonesia has best to offer.

The areas that contemporary art explores include our everyday realities, questions about personal, cultural and national identity, and reflections of humanity\u2019s impact on the environment.\nContemporary artists work in a wide range of mediums, and their artworks can be multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. Contemporary art utilises a combination of materials and methods, and concepts play a prominent part to challenge traditional boundaries and ideas of how art is defined\u2014or even what constitutes art.\nWhen engaging with contemporary art, viewers are encouraged to consider whether the work is \"thought-provoking\" or \"interesting\".

            "Here\u2019s an honest review of Dragon Hill Spa, the best Korean spa or Jjimjilbang in Seoul, and a summary of what to expect at Dragon Hill Spa.\nSweat it out at Dragon Hill Spa, the best Korean spa in Seoul, Korea!\nWhat better way to unwind\u00a0and de-stress\u00a0in the city than to treat yourself to a spa day?\nFor Koreans, one of the most popular and unique ways to relieve stress and get pampered is by enjoying a Korean sauna at a traditional Korean bathhouse called \u201cJjimjilbang (\ucc1c\uc9c8\ubc29)\u201d.\nFor foreigners, these Korean public bathhouses offer you the most authentic and unique cultural experiences such as getting naked in public and soaking in a bathtub with other people, all of which will blow your mind away.\nTo show you what it\u2019s like to experience Korean sauna culture and what to expect at a Korean spa, I, a member of Trazy Crew, visited Dragon Hill Spa in Seoul, the most famous Korean spa in the city.\nCheck out this guide to Dragon Hill Spa with a summary of my\u00a0experience plus tips below!\nDragon Hill Spa at a glance\nDragon Hill Spa is open 24 hours a day and all year round so you can visit the spa any time of the year. It is a great late-night spot to hang out with your special ones and the perfect place to escape the heat, cold or rain.\nAlong with spas and saunas, Dragon Hill Spa offers you a wide range of amenities as well, such as an internet cafe, fitness center, arcade center, and even a karaoke room.\nGoing even beyond that, it has been featured in many famous Korean dramas and TV shows, such as a popular Korean variety show called \u201cRunning Man\u201d. It was also named as one of the three best saunas in Seoul by CNN.\nIn addition, with signs and menus in English, Japanese and Chinese, the spa is also very foreigner-friendly. It\u2019s no wonder this is a very popular spa among foreign tourists!\nTips for those want to visit Dragon Hill Spa\n1. Take advantage of cheaper online tickets\nWhile you can buy tickets at a regular price on-site, you can also get discounted tickets to Dragon Hill Spa on Trazy.com. All you have to do is show your mobile voucher when you get there!\n2. Take the subway\nLocated in the district of Yongsan in central Seoul, it is very easy for first-time travelers and visitors to get to Dragon Hill Spa and taking the subway is highly recommended if you are not used to taking the local buses. The closest exit to Dragon Hill Spa is Exit 1 of Yongsan Station, from which you will find the spa located to your right. You\u2019ll have no trouble finding it since the building itself is quite large and has a huge \u2018Dragon Hill\u2019 neon sign up front.\nTips on getting prepared at Dragon Hill Spa\nOnce you present the mobile voucher from Trazy at the front desk, you will receive a sauna uniform to change into and a bracelet-like key.\nThis key opens all of your lockers (for shoes and clothes) and you can use this key to make a payment when you buy food and snacks at the cafeteria inside the building. So\u00a0never ever lose the key!!!! If you lose the key, better run-up to the front desk and ask for help. (You might be charged 30,000 won\u2026!)\nFirst of all, you have to change into the sauna uniform.\nIf you are a woman, take the elevator.\nIf you are a man, head towards the passage on the left.\nFollow the sign and enter the changing room. Then, look for the locker corresponding to the number on your key. Put all your belongings and anything valuable inside the locker.\nChange into the clothes that you received from the front (don\u2019t take off your underwear! ;).\nTips on what to enjoy in Dragon Hill Spa\n1. Don\u2019t miss these Jjimjilbang foods\nHead to the cafeteria or the snack bar on the 1st floor to try out Jjimjilbang foods.\nOne of my favorites is these Jjimjilbang eggs, which are very, very popular treats served in Korean bathhouses.\nOther bathhouses usually serve two kinds \u2013 boiled egg and roasted egg, or \u201cMaekbanseok (Stone-plate Cooked Egg)\u201d in Korean.\u00a0But you can find 3 kinds of eggs at Dragon Hill Spa.\nKoreans usually drink \u201cSikhye (Sweet Rice Drink)\u201d together with the eggs. It is a traditional Korean beverage made with rice. It has some grains of cooked rice inside it. Drink a glass of ice-cold sweet rice drink after sweating out in the saunas \u2013 100% satisfaction is guaranteed!\n2. Chill out at the public resting zone\nAt the entrance of the public resting zone, you can find these rectangular cushions/pillows.\nGrab one of these and lie down, watch TV, and enjoy Maekbanseok eggs and Sikhye with your friends and family.\nIt was kind of surprising to see so many people at the Dragon Hill Spa during the weekday, even when I visited late at night. I guess that\u2019s because Dragon Hill Spa is\u00a0really famous.\n3. Try a bit of every sauna room in Dragon Hill Spa\nNow, if you are ready to enjoy some sauna, choose the type of sauna room you want to experience.\nDragon Hill Spa offers several types of sauna rooms and zones, such as Pyramid Meditation Room, Nephrite Jade Energy Room, and Hinoki Woodland Room. So, just choose one according to your preference (In other words, the temperature you can withstand)!\nIf this is your first visit, I highly recommended these sauna rooms.\nHere\u2019s the Crystal Sun Salt Room, which is one of my favorites. Among many sauna rooms at Dragon Hill Spa, this is the most unique room, filled with salt pebbles everywhere. But do watch out when you walk on these little pebbles \u2013 they can be a bit painful.\nIf you opt for heat and steam, try the Korean traditional charcoal kiln, which\u00a0looks like an igloo. These sauna rooms are different in temperatures: low, medium and high.\nThe low-temp steam room is neither steamy nor hot. If you want more heat, you may want to move to the mid-temp room right next to it.\nFor those who don\u2019t like the heat, run over to the ice room!\nIt\u2019s the perfect spot to cool down after sweating it out in the hot sauna. But since it is freezing cold, you\u2019ll probably want to get out of this room after 2 minutes.\n4. Use a massage chair to relax your muscles\nYou\u2019ll find these comfortable massage chairs in front of the Korean traditional charcoal kiln. Just tap your key to use these massage chairs and get a great leg and back massage \ud83d\ude42\n5. Do explore other areas or floors in Dragon Hill Spa\nSince Dragon Hill Spa is a 7-story building, there are plenty of other entertainment and amenities for you to explore and enjoy.\n| BASEMENT: Cinema Hall, PC room\n| 1st FLOOR: outdoor hot spring pool, various spa zones, snack bar, and public resting zone. Royal Orchid Spa at an additional cost\n| 2nd FLOOR: female sauna, female outdoor bath, and medicinal sitz bath\n| 3rd FLOOR: female locker, female-only rad clay sauna, facial saving, and skin massage room\n| 4th FLOOR: fitness center\n| 5th FLOOR: male locker, male sauna, cold bath, aroma gold wet sauna, and men\u2019s hair salon\n| 6th FLOOR: Thai massage shop, male-only Hinoki bath, male-only red clay sleeping room, female-only sleeping room\n| 7th FLOOR: Sky Garden, Garden Cinema, and Indian barbeque\n6. Don\u2019t panic. Public bath doesn\u2019t really mean \u2018public\u2019\nAfter all the wandering, I finally headed back to the women\u2019s sauna zone to take a shower and a bath. The public bath for men and women are completely separate, so no worries. Carry your key & towel and head downstairs to the bathing area where there\u2019s a washing area for you to take a shower and a bathing\u00a0area where you can enjoy a refreshing bath experience.\nYou must take all of your clothes off, including your underwear. You\u2019ll feel embarrassed getting naked in front of so many people at first, but nobody really cares so just try to be natural. There are also various kinds of baths, so try each one! Don\u2019t forget that it is basic etiquette taking a shower before you get inside any of the tubs. \ud83d\ude09\n7. You don\u2019t need to bring your own toiletries\nIf you\u2019ve forgotten to bring your toiletries, don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a little store (a counter with a lady vendor) where you can buy all kinds of toiletries (mostly single-use) that you\u2019ll need for a shower or bath (like shampoo, conditioner, cleansing foam, etc).\nIf you are done taking a cool shower and a bath afterwards, it\u2019s time to go home! Freely use the complimentary hairdryers, toner and lotion, cotton swab, etc. prepared at the powder section. \ud83d\ude09\nLast words about my experience at Dragon Hill Spa\nOf all the Korean bathhouses that I\u2019ve been to, Dragon Hill Spa was absolutely the best. The spa and sauna experiences, along with various entertainment facilities, all of them were amazing.\nThough taking clothes off and getting used to a public bath can be awkward at first, I think all of you will enjoy this unique Korean sauna culture. Those who want to unwind in the city, head to Dragon Hill Spa for a soak today!\n[Photo Credits]\n45\nSHARES\nAccording to their website the admission fee is around 15,000 KRW\u2026inclusive of use of all amenities??? (i mean sauna room + kiln + ice room for 15,000 won only???)\ni believe the food is separately charged?? if yes, how much will i have to budget for snack/food?? say how much is one roasted egg??\nI\u2019m considering this on my itinerary this September so i need to estimate a budget for this spa experience. Hope u\u2019ll help me. Thank you. \ud83d\ude42\nHi Winnie Kay T. Corporal,\nYes, the entrance ticket includes access to all sauna, kiln and ice room. The food is separately charged and the price of the meals are between 8,000KRW~20,000KRW and the snacks are 3,000 KRW~5,000 KRW (roasted eggs \u2013 around 3,000KRW).\nThe discounted ticket for Dragon Hill Spa is currently available to purchase on Trazy so make sure to purchase the ticket in advance! \ud83d\ude00\nHi, is that a must to go for sauna or we can give it a miss. I will be travelling with my family so it does seem funny to go in water naked.\nAnyway, We will be arriving in Seoul at 6.30am in the morning so hoping to spend some time there before we check in the hotels. Can we just change and stay in the public resting area? Do we need to bring our own swimming clothes If we want to swimming in the public pool?\nHi Elizabeth! Please check the detailed information on the Dragon Hill Spa\u2019s official website: http://www.dragonhillspa.com/en/\nYou don\u2019t want to miss the ticket available at a discounted price on our website: https://www.trazy.com/experience/detail/dragon-hill-spa-seoul-korea\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\n"

            "Singaporeans are really experts at enjoying life. We are always on the hunt for shopping deals, good food and for many of us, cheap massages. But a problem arises when a massage parlour or spa is\u00a0TOO affordable \u2013 we inevitably ask, \u201cclean or not ah?\u201d\nWhile we do have our fair share of \u201cdirty\u201d massage parlours, it\u2019s not impossible to find one that\u2019s easy on the wallet\u00a0yet\u00a0also clean and good. In fact, the authorities are already cracking down on such vice-related activities \u2013 the Massage Establishments Act (effective 1 Mar 2018) now restricts massage operations and services to until 10.30pm only.\nStill, if you\u2019re looking for a good rub down \u2013 in a super shiok but not dirty way \u2013 here are some clean and cheap massage parlours in Singapore.\nMassage parlour\nHealing Touch\nNatureland\nLe Spa\nImperial Spa\nShiatsu, Swedish, Javanese massage\nDisclaimer: The best way to gauge the expertise of a masseuse (without actually going for the massage) is to ask around and read reviews \u2013 which is exactly what I did. For safety and peace of mind, I always recommend you continue reading online reviews and calling up to clear any doubts before heading down and/or booking a session.\nMassage Master\nMassage Master has two outlets \u2013 one in Bedok and one in Alexandra.\u00a0They offer both foot and full body massage services, but the latter, do not specify what techniques are used. There is only one option, and 60 minutes is the minimum duration. At $60 (or $55 for members), it is one of the cheapest full body massage services out there \u2013 the online reviews are also very good, with a 4.1-star rating on Facebook. Many previous customers seem to recommend Cindy and Mandy.\nAddress:\nAnchorpoint \u2013 370 Alexandra Road #B1-17 Anchorpoint Singapore 159953\nType of massage: General full body massage\nPrice range: $55 \u2013 $100 (members) / $60 \u2013 $110 (public)\nAncient Dynasty Spa\nAncient Dynasty Spa has a great menu of different massage services, and most of them use essential oils. Oil is only optional for the Shiatsu massage. The different types of techniques are all charged the same, and the cheapest option is $30 for the 30-minute session. The full body massages is $56 nett.\nUnless you\u2019re a member at Massage Master, Ancient Dynasty Spa is the cheapest massage parlour in this list. \u00a0The online reviews for it are also pretty impressive \u2013 many users say\u00a0it\u2019s the best massage parlour they\u2019ve ever been to.\nAddress:\nType of massage: Shiatsu, Swedish, hot stone, deep tissue massage\nPrice range: $30 \u2013 $120\nHealing Touch\nHealing Touch is perhaps the biggest affordable massage chain in Singapore. It\u2019s got 9 locations, including the upmarket Tanglin Road. Their massage menu is already super affordable ($58.85 per 60-minute massage session) but it gets even better \u2013 at their newly opened 9th outlet at City Gate, the 4P tension relief, deep tissue, Thai fusion and Shiatsu massages are going at just $49.22.\nThe award-winning chain is more a wholistic spa than massage parlour, and offers slimming and facial treatments too. Most of the\u00a0massage types are $58.85 (60 minutes), except for the manual lymphatic drainage massage, which is pricier at $85.60.\nAddress:\nOrchid Country Club \u2013\u00a01 Orchid Club Road #01-33A (Beside Gym)\nAlexandra \u2013\u00a0354 Alexandra Road, Alexis Condo #01-18\nUpper Thomson \u2013\u00a0199 Upper Thomson Rd\nNovena \u2013\u00a070 Thomson Rd\nTampines \u2013\u00a01 Tampines Central 5, CPF Tampines Bldg #05-10\nOrchard \u2013\u00a019 Tanglin Road, Tanglin Shopping Centre, #03-03\nDhoby Ghaut \u2013\u00a0Hotel Rendezvous Gallery, 9 Bras Basah Rd\u00a0#03-03\nBeach Road \u2013 371 Beach Road #02-08\nType of massage: Shiatsu, Thai fusion, deep tissue massage, lymphatic drainage\nPrice range: $58.85 \u2013 $171.20\nNatureland\nNatureland is another popular chain, and they offer either body therapy (from $62.06 for 60 mins) and tui na (from $64.20 for 60 mins). It\u2019s slightly more expensive than Healing Touch; the above rates are already discounted for members.\nYup. For the best prices, you can consider getting a membership package of credits. (They have 7 outlets across Singapore so you won\u2019t need to worry about accessibility.) Not only do you get 10% to 20% bonus credits, you can get an additional 20% off the public rates on weekdays (that\u2019s even cheaper than the member rates!).\nAddress:\nOrchard:\n\u2013 541 Orchard Road #02-01&#03-01 Liat Towers Singapore 238881\nRobertson Walk \u2013\u00a011 Unity Street #01-08/09 Singapore 237995\nRiver Valley \u2013\u00a0491 River Valley Road #02-01 Valley Point Singapore 248371\nHolland Village \u2013\u00a029/29A Lorong Liput Singapore 277740\nEast Coast \u2013\u00a0907 East Coast Rd #01-04/05 Springvale Singapore 459107\nCHIJMES \u2013\u00a030 Victoria street #B1-01/02 Singapore 187996\nType of massage: Tui Na, Shiatsu massage, aromatherapy\nPrice range: $62.06 \u2013 $115.56 (member) / $69.55 \u2013 $128.40 (public)\nLe Spa\nIf you dread the hard-selling at the end of almost every massage session, you might want to give Le Spa a shot. The team shares on its website that they\u00a0\u201cdon\u2019t advocate pressure-selling\u201d of expensive packages. Le Spa gained popularity for being open 24-7 before the Massage Establishment Act revision in March.\nHowever, although relatively affordable at $66 for 1-hour massages, the reviews for the actual massages seem mixed. If you\u2019re hesitant to try, you can call up to ask if there are first-time promotions for new customers. They have exclusive trial discounts from time to time.\nAddress:\nUpper Bukit Timah \u2013\u00a016A Chun Tin Road,\u00a0Singapore 599603\nRiver Valley \u2013\u00a013 Mohamed Sultan Road,\u00a0Singapore 238962\nType of massage: Balinese, Swedish, fusion massage\nPrice range: $42 \u2013 $130\nFeet Haven\nDespite its name, Feet Haven offers more than just foot massages \u2013 they have full body massages on their menu too. The exact technique used is not specified, and it is simply called the \u201cshiok body massage\u201d.\nThe member discount is only $2, which isn\u2019t really a big incentive. However, it\u2019s public prices are already affordable: Prices start at $55 ($53 for members) for 45\u00a0minutes, and $68 ($66 for members) for 1 hour. If you sign up for their online mailing list, you will also get a one-time 10% off your first visit. They are also having a weekday (Mon \u2013 Thu) promotional price of $50 per 60-minute full body massage session.\nAddress:\nType of massage: Full body massage\nPrice range: $55 \u2013 $124\nHeal Spa\nHeal Spa has one of the more comprehensive menus, offering\u00a0Shiatsu, Swedish, hot stone, aromatherapy and lymphatic drainage massages. The most affordable ones are Shiatsu and Swedish, both of which are $66.34. The others are $101.65.\nThe hot stone massage is one of their popular services, and uses hot Japanese volcanic stones to relieve tension and help ease fatigue. If you\u2019re not sure which type of massage is best for you, you may use their \u201cSigns and Symptoms Checker\u201d search tool on their website.\nAddress:\nTanjong Pagar \u2013\u00a0100 Tras Street,\u00a0100 AM #04-14, Singapore 079027\nLiang Court \u2013\u00a0177 River Valley Road,\u00a0#B1-06B, Singapore 179030\nCity Hall \u2013 107 North Bridge Road, #B2-17 Funan Mall, Singapore 179105\nType of massage:\u00a0Shiatsu, Swedish, hot stone, aromatherapy and lymphatic drainage massage\nPrice range:\u00a0$66.34 \u2013 $101.65\nImperial Spa\nImperial Spa offers 3 types of massages \u2013\u00a0Shiatsu, Swedish, Javanese massage. Of course, the 1-hour $69 session is more value-for-money, but if you have a tight budget, you can opt for the 30-minute massage for $41.\nThe body scrub and hot stones are by request, and are complimentary with any massage booked (worth $12). The decor is very oriental (think gold walls and wooden furniture) and fancy. The online massage reviews on Facebook and TripAdvisor are also quite good.\nAddress:\nJalan Kayu \u2013\u00a0263 Jalan Kayu\u00a0Singapore 799491\nType of massage:\u00a0Shiatsu, Swedish, Javanese massage\nPrice range:\u00a0$41 \u2013 $128\nBonus tip: Use\u00a0a booking app for even cheaper deals\nJust as there are dining reservation apps, there are now apps to help you book affordable beauty- and wellness-related services which include massages. Both platforms have a transparent review system, so you can read honest feedback by previous customers.\nFave (formerly Groupon)\nIf you\u2019re not fussy about where you get your massage, deals website/app Fave (previously Groupon) offers some of the cheapest in town. A quick visit to their site reveals rubdowns as cheap as $15 for 1 hour session, although most of these are in rather unknown places and we can\u2019t vouch for their cleanliness.\nVaniday\nIf\u00a0the deals on Fave seem a little too good to be true, there\u2019s Vaniday , a deals site that\u2019s more focused on beauty treatments. Prices are not as cheap (from $25 for 1 hour), but\u00a0the\u00a0brands look a bit more legit. Not all of these are spas, though. Some of them are nail salons and aesthetics centres that just so happen to offer quick head/shoulder/foot massages too.\nPopular types of full body massages in Singapore\nWhich type of massage should you go for?\nIf you\u2019re looking for what\u2019s called a \u201chappy ending massage\u201d, you can look elsewhere \u2013 because a lot of these services are not actually legal, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find any official websites or information on it. (You might have some luck trawling the dirty depths of local forums though\u2026)\nHere are some other popular types of massage in Singapore (clean ones). The prices for these are similar, and depends more on the establishment than the massage type.\nSwedish Massage /\u00a0Deep Tissue Massage\nThe most popular is probably the\u00a0Swedish massage, which typically uses relative gentle massage techniques to relieve tension and improve circulation. The difference\u00a0between Swedish massage and\u00a0deep tissue massage is that the latter generally uses a lot more pressure, so get ready for some initial post-massage soreness. First-timers can opt for the Swedish massage, and if that\u2019s too mild for you, try the deep tissue massage.\nThai Massage\nNext is the full body massage, Thai style. Expect lots of pressing, rocking and stretching, including some super shiok cracking of your knuckles and other joints. Traditional Thai massage rarely involves hot oils and/or lotions, so if you don\u2019t like those, this could be a good choice.\nShiatsu Massage (Acupressure Massage)\nShiatsu massage means \u201cfinger pressure massage\u201d, and is a Japanese technique that\u2019s similar to the Chinese Tui Na. Tui Na (\u201cpinch and pull\u201d) massage is sometimes called the meridian point massage as well, and is typically more for injury treatment than for relaxation. Shiatsu uses the thumbs and fingers to press and knead away muscle knots.\nDo you have a favourite cheap massage parlour to recommend?

            "by Joanne Poh on 20 December 2018\nWant to do yoga, but don\u2019t know where to start? You\u2019re hardly alone. Even though yoga has become very mainstream in Singapore, the sheer amount of options out there makes it as confusing as ever for the uninitiated.\nSo we\u2019ve simplified things for you by reviewing the prices for the most popular yoga studios, from big chains to cute boutique studios to heartland community centres.\nWhether you\u2019re looking to try it out at free or cheap yoga classes, want to sign up for an affordable class package, or want to go hardcore with an unlimited monthly pass, you can find out how much it\u2019ll cost here.\nOf course, in many cases you get what you pay for, so manage your expectations accordingly.\nContents\nAn ancient set of exercises from India focused on both\nphysical (Asana) and mental cleansing (Pranayama).\nMuch of what we see in today\u2019s yoga is a Western\nadaptation (or adaptations by Indian teachers who\nhave moved to the West, i.e. Bikram Yoga).\nOverview: Price list of yoga classes in Singapore 2019\nBefore we begin, here\u2019s a directory of the 30 yoga studios in Singapore that we surveyed. There are two price columns: price per class (based on class packages of 10 classes & above) and price per month (if the studio sells unlimited access monthly passes).\nYoga studio\n$20 to $25\n$280 to $300\n$100 to $130\n$215\nFree yoga classes (or cheap ones) in Singapore\nIf you\u2019re completely new to yoga and are wondering what it\u2019s all about, you can try it out at one of these free or cheap options for newbies.\nYoga programme\nFree\nOrganised by HPB but classes are at gyms and yoga studios. Sign up using SingPass\nFree\n12-week basic yoga course. There\u2019s a $5 to $10 registration fee at some locations\nFree trials\nFree\nAvailable at True Yoga, Pure Yoga, Fitness First, Platinum Yoga, Real Yoga\nPaid trials\n$32 onwards for 1 week\nAvailable at most boutique yoga studios e.g. Hom Yoga, Yoga Lab, Yoga Mala\nHPB Sunrise in the City\nThe Health Promotion Board works with yoga studios and gyms to offer free yoga and fitness classes to the public, predominantly weekday morning classes in the CBD area. It\u2019s open to anyone with a SingPass (including PRs and non-Singaporeans) and you can sign up for 10 classes a month. You need be quick about signing up, because, as with all freebies, they\u2019re snapped up the instant they\u2019re released (on the 1st of each month).\nNikam Yoga\nIf you want to practise yoga in its most traditional form, Nikam Guruji Yoga Kutir is a nonprofit that teaches a 3-month basic hatha yoga course for free at 20 locations. You might have to pay a $5 or $10 registration fee though (depending on location). Read this excellent review for in-depth info on Nikam Yoga .\nYoga Inc Open Mat\nBoutique yoga studio Yoga Inc has a nice programme that allows newbie yoga teachers to practise teaching in a class setting. In exchange, students simply pay as they wish. Classes are irregular though, so keep an eye on the page for upcoming ones.\nActiveSG or CC\u00a0yoga\nOf course, there\u2019s always the heartlands for cheap yoga classes at less than $10 per class, although the experience can be rather different from commercial studios. Don\u2019t expect an intense workout as they\u2019re more for a general crowd rather than hardcore yogis.\nFree trials at yoga studios\nYou can also sign up for a trial at a yoga studio. Free yoga trials are available at True Yoga, Pure Yoga, Fitness First, Platinum Yoga, Real Yoga and Yoga Collective. With the bigger chains especially, be prepared for some hard-selling at the end of your trial period.\nPaid trials at yoga studios\nAlternatively, most boutique studios also offer paid introductory passes, typically for a week of unlimited classes. Sample prices: Hom Yoga ($32), Yoga Lab ($49) and Yoga Mala ($42).\nClass packages: Affordable yoga classes in Singapore (under $25/class)\nIf you\u2019re looking to practise yoga on a casual basis and don\u2019t want the commitment of a full-time unlimited access membership, consider signing up for a 10-class, 20-class or even 50-class package. The more classes, the cheaper the package.\nYoga studio\n$20 to $25\n$22 to $30\nTypically, you will be required to use up all your classes by a certain deadline (e.g. 6 months), but otherwise you\u2019re not restricted by long lock-in periods.\nUnlimited monthly yoga passes in Singapore\nIf you go to yoga a few times a week find yourself burning through class packages, it makes more sense to sign up for monthly membership.\nThis is the pricing model used by most of the big gym chains with yoga classes: You pay the same fixed fee no matter how many classes you show up for. The longer you commit, the cheaper the price per month gets.\nYoga studio\n$100 to $130\n$215\n$280 to $300\n$283 to $359\nWhile getting a monthly pass can be quite cost-effective if you practise yoga frequently, think twice before you agree to a long commitment period like one year.\nIt means you can\u2019t jump ship easily if your favourite instructor leaves, if the management changes, or if your favourite studio location closes. And if you paid the $1,000+ upfront for membership and the yoga studio closes\u2026 well, it won\u2019t be easy to get your money back.\nWatch also: How Much Your Fitness Regime Might Cost in 2019\nWhy do some yoga studios in Singapore cost more than others?\nThere\u2019s any number of factors that makes a class at one yoga school feel different from a class at another. But in general, here are some factors to take note of when evaluating a trial class.\nClass size: The average class size can go from under 10 to over 30. Ask the studio what their maximum class size is. Also note that if you go for classes at off-peak hours, such as weekday afternoons, the class size is likely to be much smaller. Smaller class sizes mean you\u2019ll get more help from the teacher when you have difficulties.\nAmbiance: Studios spend a lot designing their interiors and trying to create an ambiance that will suit their target audience. Gyms and big chains like Pure Yoga tend to have very modern-looking interiors, sometimes with views of skyscrapers from the windows. Yoga Movement is known for its hipsterish premises.\nTeachers: Two teachers at the same yoga studio can have vastly different styles, so this is very personal. But as a general rule, teachers in more athletic disciplines like Bikram or Vinyasa tend to be more energetic and sometimes strict, while those in softer styles like yin and hatha have the tendency to be more nurturing.\nFrequency of classes: The big studios Pure Yoga and True Yoga have packed timetables with yoga classes available virtually every second of the day, which is perfect for those who want to attend classes during odd hours. Smaller studios might only have morning or evening classes on weekdays.\nStyles available: Do you want to try a buffet of styles or concentrate on one particular style? Again, bigger studios have the advantage of being able to offer a wider range of styles for those who want to dabble. On the other hand, if you want detailed instruction in one particular style, search for a boutique school that specialises in it.\nCrowds: How crowded a particular studio is will affect whether you can schedule a class at the last minute. The big chains\u2019 central locations tend to be very crowded after 6pm on weekdays, while the smaller boutique studios, especially those far from the CBD, tend to have a bit more breathing room.\nLocation: Big gym chains and the bigger boutique studios have multiple locations, and you are usually allowed to use all of them with a single subscription or package. Smaller studios will be confined to one or two locations.\nCommunity: The people you\u2019ll be practising with and the type of community the school builds is something you might want to consider. Generally, at the big gyms and chains, there is more anonymity. People come for class and then leave. At boutique or smaller set-ups, there might be more of a community feel. In addition, some studios like Yoga Movement and Yoga Inc. have chill-out spots where you can socialise before and after class.\nMats and towels: Check if you\u2019re required to bring your own mats and towels. If these are available on-site, you want to know if they\u2019re free or for rent. Generally, gyms and big chains will provide free mats and towels. At boutique studios, you might be expected to bring your own.\nShower facilities: These are generally available at the big chains and gyms, but not always at boutique studios, so ask in advance. If you\u2019re doing hot yoga, you\u2019ll definitely need to take a shower.\nOther facilities: More and more studios now have on-site cafes and perks, which make going for yoga more of a lifestyle activity. Some also organise events and social programmes for members.\nHatha yoga, hot yoga, vinyasa yoga\u2026 Which yoga style\u00a0should you choose?\nIf we\u2019re going to be pedantic about it, yoga is a set of practices which came from India. And by practices, we don\u2019t just mean twisting yourself into pretzel-like postures.\nIn addition to asana, which are the physical postures we\u2019re most used to associating with yoga, yogic practices also include cleansing exercises to ensure parts of your body are free of impurities, as well as breath control exercises called pranayama. There are other yogic practices, such as rules of conduct and diet, that are generally not taught at schools.\nDoes that sound very distant from the beer yoga, laughing yoga and other novelty variants we\u2019ve become accustomed to hearing about? Well, yes. The vast majority of styles we see today have been Western adaptations (or adaptations that were made when Indian teachers left for the West) of the traditional ways of practising it.\nFor instance, Bikram Yoga, the original \u201chot yoga\u201d, in which practitioners do a series of poses in a heated room, was started no doubt by an Indian teacher, but only when he emigrated to the United States and created the system to appeal to an American audience.\nBefore you choose a studio or school, you need to first understand what style you\u2019re interested in practising. Not sure? Dip your toes into the waters of a few styles by attending trial classes.\nHere are some of the most common styles of yoga in Singapore.\nIntermediate\nAcroyoga\nBikram Yoga\nHot Yoga\nVinyasa Yoga\nAshtanga Yoga\nHatha yoga:A sequence of postures executed at a relaxed pace. Depending on the teacher these can be done in a chain or with periods of rest in between.\nBikram yoga: The original hot yoga. A sequence of 26 fixed postures done in a heated room.\nHot yoga: A sequence of postures done in a heated room. However, the sequence of postures can be of any type \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have to follow the Bikram sequence.\nAshtanga yoga: Physically demanding and vigorous series of postures. Gives an aerobic workout, so prepare to be sweating by the end of your session.\nVinyasa yoga: A dynamic and vigorous sequence of \u00a0exercises practised in a chain, similar to Ashtanga yoga.\nYin yoga: Poses are held for a long time to deeply stretch the muscles and ligaments.\nIyengar yoga: Poses are held for a long time, and props like straps and blocks are used to help practitioners go deeper into a pose.\nKundalini yoga: Originally, the traditional form of this style involved lots of meditation, pranayama and chanting aimed at arousing the life force at the base of the spine. Modern forms can look very different and have a stronger emphasis on postures, but are generally not very physically demanding.\nAcro yoga: As the name suggests, it\u2019s a yoga and acrobatics hybrid. It\u2019s a form of partner yoga, meaning you do poses while lifting or being lifted by a partner.\nAerial yoga: You execute postures while suspended from the ceiling on a sash.\nPrenatal yoga: As the same suggests, it\u2019s a gentle yoga variant for pregnant women.\nUltimately, the choice of a yoga school is a very personal one, and you\u2019ve got to ask yourself what you want to get out of your practice.\nSponsored Message\nWant to get access to multiple gyms instead of just one?

            "Before you get started, keep these tips in mind:\nChoose a place to do your breathing exercise. It could be in your bed, on your living room floor, or in a comfortable chair.\nDon't force it. This can make you feel more stressed.\nTry to do it at the same time once or twice a day.\nWear comfortable clothes.\nMany breathing exercises take only a few minutes. When you have more time, you can do them for 10 minutes or more to get even greater benefits.\nDeep Breathing\nMost people take short, shallow breaths into their chest. It can make you feel anxious and zap your energy. With this technique, you'll learn how to take bigger breaths, all the way into your belly.\nGet comfortable. You can lie on your back in bed or on the floor with a pillow under your head and knees. Or you can sit in a chair with your shoulders, head, and neck supported against the back of the chair.\nBreathe in through your nose. Let your belly fill with air.\nBreathe out through your nose.\nPlace one hand on your belly. Place the other hand on your chest.\nAs you breathe in, feel your belly rise. As you breathe out, feel your belly lower. The hand on your belly should move more than the one that's on your chest.\nTake three more full, deep breaths. Breathe fully into your belly as it rises and falls with your breath.\nBreath Focus\nWhile you do deep breathing, use a picture in your mind and a word or phrase to help you feel more relaxed.\nClose your eyes if they're open.\nTake a few big, deep breaths.\nBreathe in. As you do that, imagine that the air is filled with a sense of peace and calm. Try to feel it throughout your body.\nBreathe out. While you're doing it, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension.\nNow use a word or phrase with your breath. As you breathe in, say in your mind, \"I breathe in peace and calm.\"\nAs you breathe out, say in your mind, \"I breathe out stress and tension.\"\nContinue for 10 to 20 minutes.\nContinued\nEqual Time for Breathing in and Breathing Out\nIn this exercise, you'll match how long you breathe in with how long you breathe out. Over time, you'll increase how long you're able to breathe in and out at a time.\nSit comfortably on the floor or in a chair.\nBreathe in through your nose. As you do it, count to five.\nBreathe out through your nose to the count of five.\nRepeat several times.\nOnce you feel comfortable with breaths that last five counts, increase how long you breathe in and breathe out. You can work up to breaths that last up to 10 counts.\nProgressive Muscle Relaxation\nIn this technique, you breathe in as you tense a muscle group and breathe out as you release it. Progressive muscle relaxation helps you relax physically and mentally.\nLie comfortably on the floor.\nTake a few deep breaths to relax.\nBreathe in. Tense the muscles of your feet .\nBreathe out. Release the tension in your feet.\nBreathe in. Tense your calf muscles.\nBreathe out. Release the tension in your calves .\nWork your way up your body. Tense each muscle group. This includes your legs, belly, chest, fingers, arms, shoulders, neck, and face.\nModified Lion's Breath\nAs you do this exercise, imagine that you're a lion. Let all of your breath out with a big, open mouth .\nSit comfortably on the floor or in a chair.\nBreathe in through your nose. Fill your belly all the way up with air.\nWhen you can't breathe in any more, open your mouth as wide as you can. Breathe out with a\u00a0\"HA\"\u00a0sound.\nRepeat several times.\nWebMD Medical Reference Reviewed by Nayana  Ambardekar, MD on January 19, 2020\nSources\nSOURCES:\nHarvard Medical School: \"Relaxation Techniques: Breath Control Helps Quell Errant Stress Response,\" \"A Breathing Technique To Help You Relax,\" \"Relaxation Techniques: Breath Focus.\"\nAmerican Council on Exercise: \"6 Breathing Exercises to Reduce Stress.\"\nMayo Clinic: \"Diaphragmatic Breathing.\"\nCleveland Clinic: \"Diaphragmatic Breathing.\"\nBreastCancer.org: \"Progressive Muscle Relaxation.\"\nPagination\nHealth Solutions\nWebMD does not provide medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.\n"

Take a hike up Bukit Timah Hill or, for the adventurous, venture off the beaten path and explore the jungles of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve by mountain bike or foot.\nA more laidback option awaits you at Bukit Timah Saddle Club when you pop by Riders Caf\u00e9 , which overlooks the nearby stables\u2014if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll spot horses trotting in one of the riding arenas . Come weekends, the little ones can have a go at riding ponies at selected timings.\nRobertson Quay\nPhoto by Marklin Ang\nCosy up on a sofa in the Book Caf\u00e9 with a cup of tea\u2014the eatery\u2019s stocked with an extensive selection of magazines, foreign and local newspapers, plus free Wi-Fi and a photocopier.\nAlternatively, the Reading Room \u2019s where all manner of bookworms congregate, thanks to the plush seats, wooden tables and shelves of books lining its interior. Come evening, the space transforms into a bar so you\u2019ll get your booze fix, easy.\nYogis can get their Namaste at Yoga Movement studio, situated above the famed Common Man Coffee Roasters (the caf\u00e9 churns out a mean flat white and decent brunch mains). Round up your day by soaking in the arts at printmaking institute STPI or the Singapore Repertory Theatre , where performances, readings and musicals take front and centre.\nPunggol Waterfront/Coney Island\nPhoto by Darren Soh\nPunggol is a little far off from the city centre, but you\u2019ll be surprised by the options awaiting you on this end of the island. Explore the Punggol Waterway Park by bicycle\u2014there are scores of rental shops around offering hourly rates\u2013or meander the carved paths of Coney Island . After, nosh on the popular white bee hoon (rice vermicelli) at The White Restaurant that\u2019s just minutes from Coney Island, or try one of the eateries at the Punggol East Container Park. Extend your day into an island-hopping trip to Kusu Island or Lazarus Island, which you can get to by boat from Marina Country Club .\nCivic District\nPhoto by Charles Loh\nLooking to relax and unwind in the heart of the city? The answer lies in Capitol Piazza , just steps from City Hall MRT Station. Have your hair and nails done at Branch\u00e9 , pick up a hand-drip coffee from Hoshino Coffee then sniff out a designer fragrance at Scentre .\nDon\u2019t forget to admire the exhibits at the nearby National Gallery (we suggest visiting in the late afternoon, to catch the dappled sunlight marking the floors of the Padang Atrium within). Conclude your trip by unwinding with some tea at the museum\u2019s in-house caf\u00e9 and design store, Gallery & Co .\nIf you\u2019d rather be outdoors, make for the tranquil memorial garden at the Armenian Church , Singapore\u2019s oldest Christian church.\nDiscover More\nConnect with us\n"

            "Going Clubbing In South Korea\nFrom dressing up in hanboks at Gyeongbokgung Palace with oppas to shopping till you drop at the Myeongdong Market, Seoul is an amazing city with infinite things to do. It\u2019s no wonder that the South Korean capital is the second most popular destination for Singaporeans.\nBut if you\u2019re new to the Seoul clubbing scene and unsure of what to expect, there are some tips such as knowing how Korean guys flirt and which clubs are best suited for your age group.\nTo save you from incessant Googling, here are some tips you can follow for a 10/10 night out.\nBefore entering the club\n1. Pre-drinking with S$1 bottles of soju\nHave a dinner of KBBQ near the clubbing hotspots to line your stomach before drinking. Get drunk off soju bombs at the restaurant or hop over to the nearest convenience store (C-U and 7-11) for ~S$1 bottled soju.\nThere aren\u2019t Korean laws which prohibit you from drinking in public, or an alcohol curfew in place so you\u2019re good to drink by the roadside.\n2. Wear a coat in the winter\nThe dress code differs according to where you\u2019re clubbing. Hongdae\u2019s club-goers wear a more relaxed uniform of streetwear (think Hypebeast aesthetic), while Gangnam\u2019s clubs are stricter, requiring guys to turn up in suits. Standard dress rules still apply; ladies should avoid open-toed shoes, and gents shouldn\u2019t wear shorts.\nIf you\u2019re clubbing during winter, you\u2019ll see many Korean girls dressed in short skirts and barely-there leggings. While it\u2019s tempting to follow their example, remember you\u2019re a creature born of the tropics.\nDo yourself a favour: wear jeans and bring a coat. The coat hanging service only costs KRW3,000 (~S$3.75) in most clubs and you won\u2019t have to freeze your nipples off.\n3. Bring your passport and check the club\u2019s age limit\nIf you\u2019re not Korean, bring your passport. Clubs are quite particular and will not accept foreign ICs or car licenses as IDs. You have to be at least 19 years old.\n4. Check the club\u2019s Facebook page for free entry\nThe average cost of cover is KRW10,000 (~S$12.50) to KRW 30,000 (~S$37.50). If you go before midnight, entry fees are usually discounted. Some clubs let foreigners in for free, but you should check their Facebook page.\n5. Clubs tend to open all through the week\nIt\u2019s common for clubs to open throughout the week. Usually, clubs open at 10.00pm and close at 6.00am.\nChoosing a club\nIn Seoul, clubs are mainly located in the Hongdae, Itaewon, and Gangnam districts. If you\u2019re younger (19 to 23 years old) you\u2019ll fit in more with the crowd in the Hongdae area. If you\u2019re older (>24 years old), you\u2019ll probably like the Itaewon and Gangnam bar scene more.\nThe clubs are usually clustered in one location and are within walking distance from each other, so it\u2019s easy to club hop.\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to get lit, here\u2019s a list of clubs our resident Korea-expert, Leah Shannon, have checked out and enjoyed partying at.\nAlso read:\nDuring clubbing\n6. Smoking is allowed in the clubs\nYou can smoke in most clubs so be prepared to come out smelling like ash.\n7. Korean guys aren\u2019t shy about getting handsy\nWhile most Koreans prefer to dance and drink with the group they came with, Korean guys can be quite forward with their advances.\nWhen a Korean guy is interested in you, he might grab or put his arms around you without permission. If you\u2019re uncomfortable, just turn around and wave him off or shake your head. They aren\u2019t douchebags about rejection\u2013they\u2019ll most probably smile apologetically and leave you alone.\n8. Korean guys might ask you to leave the club and go drinking\nAlternatively, a Korean guy might signal interest by asking if you\u2019d want to leave and head to a nearby drinking joint. They usually will approach you in groups of two or three, and don\u2019t mind if you bring your girlfriends along.\nThey just want to get to know you better in a quieter environment in a place where drinks aren\u2019t so expensive. If he can\u2019t English and you can\u2019t Korean, use the power of Google Translate.\n9. Going home with someone\nIf all goes well and he asks if you want to \u201ceat ramyun at his place\u201d and you\u2019re into it, don\u2019t forget the condoms.\nAfter clubbing\n10. Request for a metered fare when getting a cab\nSome Seoul cabbies will try to quote drunk club-goers a hiked up fee. Avoid getting scammed by insisting your cabbie turn on the meter, and know how much a cab ride back to your place costs.\nEspecially if you can\u2019t speak Korean, the last thing you want after a wild night out is to argue with an ahjussi about cab prices.\n11. Buy hangover \u2018cures\u2019 at convenience stores\nIf you\u2019ve had too much to drink, feel less terrible by drinking Haejang-guk or hangover soup the next morning. The soup contains dried Napa cabbage, vegetables in a hearty beef broth, and will help settle the churning in your stomach.\nAlternatively, try recovery drinks found in convenience stores. Dawn 80, Bacchus, condition and Morning Care are healthy herbal and vitamin mixes which can help you bounce back from a hangover more quickly.\nSouth Korean Clubbing Scene\nWith this list of clubbing tips in mind, it\u2019s time to knock back those soju bombs and party it up in Seoul!\nAlso read:\nTags:\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\nAbout Us\nZULA is a female website and Youtube channel for Singaporean Millennials.\nWe create daily content about beauty, fashion, dating, and stories of everyday women.\nTo submit a story or advertise, drop us an email at hello@zula.sg.\nZula YouTube\nTop Posts & Pages\n62\nSHARES\n"

            "Website\nWebsite\nWebsite\nWebsite\nWebsite\nWebsite\nWebsite\n05 Apr 2019\nThese are the hottest night clubs in Seoul to party the night away\nTravel\nThese are the hottest night clubs in Seoul to party the night away\nShare this article\nSeoulites sure know how to party. The number of night clubs in Seoul is a testament of that, further\u00a0proving that they have a deep-rooted culture of music, singing, and dancing. After all, aspiring Kpop artists needed to start practising somewhere. Nearly every district in Seoul has its own few night clubs, but which begs the question: which do you go to?\nWhile most would think of night clubs as playing the current mainstream dance music, night clubs in Seoul differ slightly. Certain clubs are known for playing only a particular type of music, whether it\u2019s hip hop, old school R&B, new EDM, or progressive house. Be sure to pick your genre of music wisely, lest you end up heading over and not like the type of music you\u2019re hearing.\nOf course, the most important part is the crowd. The whole point of partying it up in Seoul is to get to know like-minded young and beautiful people, and how they let loose. Sounds fun? Read on to see which night clubs in Seoul you can dance the night away \u2014 and even until sunrise.\n1\nBoombar\nMost times, you won\u2019t be able to see what the club looks night because of the flashing lights. But at Boombar, you\u2019ll definitely appreciate its classy interior of chandeliers, velvet couches in the VIP area, and overall lounge style. They mostly play hip hop music and are open from Thursday to Sunday.\n2\nCakeshop\nSuffice to say, Cakeshop is currently one of the hottest clubs in Seoul. Located in Itaewon, this club is on the smaller side but seems to host some pretty big musical acts including Nosaj Thing. They predominantly play hip hop and electronic music and are open from Thursday to Sunday. Expect weekends to be jampacked with people.\n(Picture: Cakeshop Seoul Facebook)\nClub Arena\nPut on your best party outfit, because Club Arena has a pretty strict dress code to enter. It\u2019s no surprise that most of the clubgoers here are extremely well-dressed and good looking. It focuses on the latest EDM and progressive house music, which makes for an extremely high-octane partying night out. If you have extra cash to spare, book yourself a VIP booth near the stage and check out the hired dancers and models. They are only open on Fridays and Saturdays.\n(Picture:\u00a0Club Arena Facebook)\nClub Made\nIf you can\u2019t choose between wanting EDM or hip hop music, then you\u2019re in luck at Made. The club is divided between two zones \u2014 EDM and hip hop \u2014 so you can move between zones depending on which vibe you\u2019re feeling more that night. That said, Made is quite the upscale night club. Naturally, it\u2019s in Gangnam. It opens from Thursday to Saturday and closes at 6 AM, so you can quite literally party till the sun rises. The club also includes a cover charge at KRW20,000.\n(Picture: Club Made Facebook)\nOctagon Club\nNo club list in Seoul is complete without including Octagon Club inside. It is perhaps Seoul\u2019s most popular club and is even ranked fifth best club in the world by DJ Mag in 2017. Naturally, getting in won\u2019t be easy. There\u2019s a cover charge of KRW30,000 and the lines are extremely long on weekends. There are multiple floors in the club all decked out in different themes, which make for a seriously hard-partying time. It\u2019s open till 6 AM as well.\n6\nNB2\nThis one\u2019s for the Kpop fans \u2014 NB2 is owned and managed by YG, one of the biggest entertainment companies in South Korea. It goes without saying that hip hop is what moves this club, other than the fact that it\u2019s open daily until 6 AM. If you\u2019re lucky, you might even get to see some YG Entertainment Kpop artists.\nClub Cream\nClub Cream is where budding hip hop stars go to be noticed. Other than an extremely popular hip hop scene, the club also hosts Everyone\u2019s Mic, an open mic night where aspiring rappers can take a chance at performing their works or engaging in rap battles with other rappers. It\u2019s very \u201c8 Mile\u201d, except it\u2019s all in Korean. While you may not understand what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s always worth checking it out and engaging in the hype. Club Cream is open six days a week and doesn\u2019t have an entrance fee.\nEditor, Kuala Lumpur\nPoh Nee is the editor and writes about travel and drinks.

But what\u2019s more interesting about Cash Studio is that it\u2019s known amongst fans of Japanese and Malay music for having a good assortment of J-pop, J-rock and uber sentimental Malay music in its mix. And if the room is vacant after your designated timeslot, they might let you stick around a little longer!\nCash Studio , various outlets including Ming Arcade, Cuppage Plaza and Paya Lebar.\nParty World\nYou can\u2019t think of karaoke in Singapore without immediately thinking of Party World. This KTV institution offers a gamut of song choices in a variety of languages, and reasonable prices which include alcohol. After all, what\u2019s a karaoke party without booze, right?\nParty World , various outlets islandwide including Nex, Liang Court and Bukit Batok.\nWe\u2019re remaining anoymous for this one!\n\u201cIs it really even karaoke if you don\u2019t sing a terribly epic rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody?\u201d\n\u201cBackstreet Boys \u2018cos we\u2019re basically 90s kids.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Britney, b*tch! Her debut album, in particular, was my jam\u2026 Baby One More Time and also Oops I Did It Again.\u201d\n\u201cIt has to be Shake It Off by Taylor Swift, my go-to song when I need to remind myself that I\u2019m a badass b*tch!\u201d\n\u201cAll hits from Queen is a must! I Want to Break Free, Don\u2019t Stop Me Now, Radio Ga Ga, Somebody to Love and of course, Bohemian Rhapsody. I could go on all day.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we forget Queen Ri Ri? There\u2019s Diamonds, We Found Love, Unfaithful, Only Girl in The World. Ultimate guilty pleasure.\u201d\n\u201cI HAVE to sing Hold On by Wilson Philips. It\u2019s a song I sing for positive, personal empowerment.\u201d\n\u201cAnything from the Princess of Pop: Britney Spears. The original Queen B. I will sing anything from her first album to last. Or any broadway song. And the occasional Whitney and Mariah. I find that I can definitely reach those notes after three glasses of wine.\u201d\n\u201cA few drinks inside me and Trace the Face busts out the moves and the notes to Madonna\u2019s Like A Prayer. Every. Single. Time.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I karaoke I don\u2019t even know myself. I pick boyband songs from across the generations like Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, One Direction\u2026 and then I move on to Southern hip-hop which is really crass compared to their East Coast counterparts. And then I cover emo-pop ditties like Fall Out Boy and the sorts. Hell is other people\u2019s music and the karaoke room is purgatory.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m that guy who\u2019s convinced they can rap after a few drinks, so everyone has to suffer through Gangsta\u2019s Paradise by Coolio.\u201d\nWant the scoop on all things quarantine and chill?\n"

But if you\u2019re borderline snobbish about your martini, G&T , or negroni then you\u2019ve come to the right place. From whiskey watering holes , the most underrated speakeasies and recipients of Asia\u2019s 50 Best Bars , you\u2019ll find the perfect place for your drinking needs within this thorough guide to the best cocktails in Singapore. Cheers to that!\nLive Twice\nPhotography: Venkat Gunasellan\nJigger and Pony has breathed new life to the now-defunct Flagship space with a new-style Japanese cocktail bar \u2013 Live Twice. The menu is divided into two categories: One life for yourself and one for your dreams (inspired by Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cYou Only Live Twice\u201d). For the classicist, go for the mizuwari, a blend of Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky and Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky that is steeped in a pot with Hokkaido soft water for a minimum of three days. The Little Bell is for those who want a little zing in their lives. It\u2019s a clean mix of VSOP calvados by Christian Drouin, bell pepper and honey \u2013 a spirit-forward cocktail for discerning drinkers.\nLive Twice , 20 Bukit Pasoh Road, Singapore 089834\nThe Old Man\nNow that the original bar in Hong Kong has topped Asia\u2019s 50 Best Bars list, there\u2019s no excuse to delay your visit. Nine devilishly good cocktails make up the menu at The Old Man Singapore \u2013 inspired by Ernest Hemingway\u2019s work, but with an Asian twist. Sip on drinks like The Sun Also Rises \u2013 an Asian Negroni concocted with coconut oil fat-washed applejack, curry leaf infused gin, sweet vermouth sous-vide pandan leaves and kaffir lime. Or try The Snows of Kilimanjaro, a boozy take on Yakult spiked with marshmallow gin, lacto-fermented raspberry, citrus, and topped with gruyere cheese. Intrigued? We\u2019ll be back for more \u2013 and the fact that all cocktails are priced at just $17++.\nBeGin\nPhotography: Nicole Nithiyah\nLet the drinks (and gin puns) BeGin. Hidden upstairs the English pub Penny Black on Boat Quay, it might be easy to miss BeGin at first glance \u2013 a testament to a good speakeasy amirite? Once you do spot it (follow the pink neon light sign that says \u2018gin this way\u2019) be transported to an industrial-esque space from Britain\u2019s Industrial Revolution and the gin craze in the 1700s. Expect exposed brick walls, concrete floor, retro high stools and old-school tools used as decor. The drinks menu is filled with British-Indian-inspired tipples, theatrical cocktails and over 50 gins from around the globe. House creations like the spice-heavy Jagmohan to the fragrant Lavender will take you on a multi-sensory ride. If you\u2019re feeling peckish, Samboo-sa pasties (tandoori chicken masala curry puffs) and the Nacho Del Goa (prawns and papadum bites) pack a punch.\nBeGin , 27a Boat Quay, The Penny Black Upstairs, Singapore 049817\nTippling Club\nWe all need a fancy-schmancy night out every now and then \u2013 one of the firsts dinner spots that come to mind is Tippling Club. As for the drinks, the progressive cocktail menu is inspired by perfumes. So expect a multi-sensorial experience that engages all your senses.\nTippling Club , 38 Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore 088461\nIB HQ\nPhotography: IB HQ via Instagram\nThis speakeasy-like situation adds a Southeast Asian twist to the menu, whipping out mind-blowing infusions made in-house. Don\u2019t believe us? Try the Maharaja, made with curry gin (flavour explosion guaranteed!) for yourself. The Painapuru is very much a drinkable dessert with a great combination of matcha gin, chocolate vodka, pineapple, Kochi citrus and Gomme.\nIB HQ , 774A North Bridge Road, Singapore 198742\nNATIVE\nPhotography: NATIVE\nNow, after a few twists and turns, no thanks to Google maps, we found this gem of a bar. Located on the second floor of an unassuming shop house, Native has a succinct cocktail menu that changes from time to time. Vijay Mudaliar, the audacious fellow behind Native and its creations, focuses on foraging from his surroundings. So, if you\u2019re brave enough, order the cocktail served with edible ants! Oh, did we mention? You can have a quick tour of the microdistillery located above the bar for some boozy education.\nNative , 52A Amoy Street, Singapore 069878\nLulu\u2019s Lounge\nPhotography: LuLu\u2019s Lounge\nBased on a fictional, salacious protagonist from 1960s New York, Lulu\u2019s Lounge is the brainchild of Joshua and Sarissa Schwartz, the power couple behind Employees Only Singapore. The new bar and live music venue boasts an aesthetic that\u2019s part-suave, part-grimy \u2013 you\u2019ll spot sleek couches oozing class and charm, as well as raw brick walls tainted by graffiti and ultraviolet scribbles. You\u2019ll definitely be spoilt for choice with bartenders\u2019 Tertius Wharton and Julyan Phillips\u2019 cocktail selections too; try the Cherry Red Lace, Loosen Mai Tai or the Slip of the Tipple that\u2019s even garnished with nipple pasties.\nLulu\u2019s Lounge , Pan Pacific Hotel, Singapore, 7 Raffles Boulevard, Singapore 039595\nFlying Monkey\nPhotography: Flying Monkey\nThere was a lot to take in when we\u00a0first heard of this bar on Bussorah street. Contemporary Indian? Tapas? Cocktails? There really aren\u2019t many serious Indian restaurants in Singapore with focused bar programs. That\u2019s where Flying Monkey distinguishes itself. The bar menu features Indian-inflected cocktails like an Old Fashioned with King\u2019s ginger and jaggery syrup. For something more exotic, try the the Lassi Wassi. It is an adult version of the classic Indian yoghurt drink which is spiked with Monkey Shoulder whiskey.\nFlying Monkey , 67 Bussorah Street, Singapore 199480\nBar Stories\nPhotography: Bar Stories via Facebook\nBar Stories is one of those blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cocktail bars located at the lively Haji Lane . Shared with Scaled by Ah Hua Kelong \u2013 a farm-to-table restaurant that uses produce from local seafood markets \u2013 Bar Stories is one of the first bespoke cocktail bars to open in Singapore.

Just ask the friendly bartenders and they\u2019ll whip up the perfect tipple for you. Oh, and while you\u2019re there, you have to try the curry mussels from Scaled by Ah Hua Kelong.

Adorned throughout with debonair emerald hues and gold, metallic accents, Cin Cin evokes a nostalgic trip into the past with its Prohibition Era theme. Gin is this headquarters\u2019 specialty, so arm your appetites for DIY martinis, negronis, and other bespoke cocktails like the DR. Earl Potion. Check out our review , where we toasted \u201ccin cin!\u201d to this ritzy city bar.\nCin Cin , #01-02 Oasia Hotel Downtown Singapore, 100 Peck Seah Street, Singapore 079333\nATLAS\nPhotography: Atlas\nThe Art Deco- and almost Gotham City-esque exterior of Parkview Square makes it one of\u00a0Singapore\u2019s most spectacular\u00a0buildings, and its new gin-focused lobby bar is an extension of that theme. Taking inspiration from the Roaring Twenties, Atlas Bar aims to be a luxurious interpretation of the grand European lobby bars of the Art Deco age. The open atrium-style bar offers masterfully crafted cocktails (by its\u00a0Head Bartender, Jesse Vida), as well as what is perhaps Singapore\u2019s largest gin collection \u2013 Atlas already features over 1,300 bottles of gin, and it\u2019s set to grow\u2026 in its magnificent gin tower, no less!\nATLAS , Parkview Square, 600 North Bridge Road, Singapore 188778\nThe Other Room\nPhotography: The Other Room\n\u201cSpeakeasy\u201d is a description thrown around a lot these days, but The Other Room is probably one of the few cocktail bars we\u2019ve found that are really hidden away, with only the scantest online presence. This \u201cdrinking house for the discerning\u201d offers expertly crafted cocktails that pay homage to classic drinks while adding contemporary twists.\nThe Other Room , 320 Orchard Road, #01-05 Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel, 238865\nLe Binchotan\nEastern and Western influences come together in meticulously crafted cocktails in this addition to Amoy Street\u2019s bustling bar scene.\u00a0Hungry?

Find out more .\nLe Binchotan , 115 Amoy Street #01-04 (Entrance via Gemmill Lane), Singapore 069935\nEmployees Only Singapore\nIn a nutshell, expect a bespoke cocktail experience worthy of the \u201c4th Best Bar In The World\u201d accolade, with an ambience that\u2019s neither stuffy nor exclusive. Split up into apertifs, cocktails and long drinks, the menu uses regional ingredients like basil, mango, ginger and pineapple. And don\u2019t even get us started on the bites! We have been stoked for this\u00a0a long time.\nSmoke & Mirrors\nPhotography: Smoke & Mirrors\nThis bar atop the National Gallery oozes sophistication with its skyline view overlooking The Padang, The Esplanade and the Marina Bay Sands. And just as impressive is its modern decor with warm wood and metal accents. Grab a seat by the balcony, and take in the view while sipping creative, almost magical concoctions by Head Bartender,\u00a0Jorge Conde , like\u00a0The Japanese Gang is Still Alive, concocted with fat-washed black sesame and black rice with butter and whisky and topped with a frothy rice vinegar and aquafaba (brine from legumes), and the potent La Fumata Bianca, a twist on the Negroni.\nSmoke & Mirrors , #06-01 National Gallery Singapore, 1 St. Andrew\u2019s Road, Singapore 178957\nLime House Caribbean\nPhotography: Lime House Caribbean via Facebook\nLiving here, you\u2019re probably well accustomed to island life by now, but how cushy are you with Caribbean culture? Broaden your horizons (and your repertoire of tipple conquests) at this vibrant rum lounge at Lime House Caribbean . Honouring the traditions of Tobago \u2013 hence, its name \u2013 the place urges you to adopt the spirit of \u201climing\u201d, the art of doing nothing but having a good time. Sign us up! The colonial-decor lounge appeases with an appetising side of fish goujans and a glass of Rum Old Fashioned, which is a dark mix made with Abuelo rum and lime angostura bitters.\nHopscotch\nPhotography: Hopscotch via Facebook\nPrefer quirky to classic? Head down to\u00a0this delightfully kitschy little bar tucked away in Gillman Barracks.\u00a0Pick from an incredible variety of absolutely zany Singaporean-inspired cocktail offerings, from bandung shots and a boozy take on muah chee to an alcoholic rendition of Pei Pa Kao.\nHopscotch ,\u00a045 Malan Road, Singapore 109455\nPhotography: Gibson via Facebook\nWhile the gold-accented interior may insinuate upmarket, a tipsy trip to Gibson is far from\u00a0a formal, stuffy bar experience. The award-winning Gibson prides itself on its wide selection of potent tipples in its drinks menu, pleasing even the most discerning drinker. Cocktails aside, Gibson also lets you\u00a0enjoy a\u00a0modest selection of raw seafood dishes like the scallop crudo.\nGibson Bar , Level 2, 20 Bukit Pasoh Road, Singapore 089832\nOxwell & Co\nA popular gastropub that\u2019s a stalwart of Ann Siang , Oxwell & Co has more than just your Sunday roast . Kick back and enjoy a couple of quirky cocktails at this breezy rooftop bar \u2013 it also offers a specially curated G&T menu, including the famous Gin & Chronic.\nOxwell & Co. , 5 Ann Siang Road, Singapore 069688\nJigger & Pony\nPhotography: Jigger & Pony\nSkilful, attentive, and extremely creative, the bartenders at Jigger & Pony concoct some of the best bespoke cocktails in town. With over 25 cocktails on the menu, no two (or three or four) visits are ever the same! Jigger & Pony\u2019s Old Fashioned gives a subtle fruity twist as your swirl the colourful citrus wheel around. Sip on trendy signatures such as the Madame President (pictured above), a deconstructed Negroni with a Campari lollipop. Yum!\nJigger & Pony , Lobby Level, Amara Singapore, 165 Tanjong Pagar Road, Singapore 088539\nJekyll & Hyde\nPhotography: Jekyll & Hyde\nJekyll & Hyde\u2019s a bespoke cocktail bar, so yes, you can order exactly what your heart desires. But if you\u2019re in a big group, go for the boozy punch bowls that are named after flavour profiles: Sweet and sour. The former is a boozy Vitagen concoction and the latter is a citrusy blend of vodka, yuzu sake, lemon and soda.\nJekyll & Hyde , 49 Tras Street, Singapore 078988\nOperation Dagger\nPhotography: Operation Dagger via Facebook\nTo enter the underground lair of Operation Dagger, you first have to walk through a dingy, dark stairwell that\u2019s marked by a scrawl of a curious rectangle and upside-down crown.\u00a0For a fiery start, try the Golden Mile (named after the complex), a mix of coconut, Thai herbs and chilli droplets that look like a science experiment. Sweet tooths can pick the E-701, a lusciously-red tipple thanks to the beetroot infusion, with a sweet zing that will remind you of a red velvet cake. Finally, the Cheese, No Egg tipple (a smokey concoction of cheddar, honey and cream) looks simply divine.\nOperation Dagger , #B1-01, 7 Ann Siang Hill, Singapore 069791\nMaison Ikkoku\nBoth a caf\u00e9 and a cocktail bar, Maison Ikkoku is where you will find all the trendiest peeps. Owned by Ethan Leslie Leong \u2013 the creator of Asia\u2019s most expensive cocktail \u201cThe Jewel of Pangaea\u201d (it was $35k a glass!) \u2013 you can bet your bottom dollar any concoction\u2019s gonna be uh-mazing. Go loco for coco with their impressive chocolate flamb\u00e9-tini that\u2019s served with toasted marshmallow and cookie roll.\nMaison Ikkoku , 20 Kandahar Street, Singapore 198885\n28 Hong Kong Street\nSans PR fanfare and signage out front, 28 Hong Kong Street is notorious for snubbing the system in the most radical way when it first opened its doors. The place screams privacy and quiet with the non-descript entrance, but once inside, it\u2019s safe to be social with a group of friends! The best part for tippleholics is the larger standard shot served here (as compared to the usual 30ml). Cocktails are also priced reasonably at\u00a0$15-22. Reservations are required; tables get snapped up faster than free ice cream \u2013 no kidding.\nNeon Pigeon\nPhotography: Neon Pigeon via Facebook\nFrom the graffiti murals on the walls to the quirky ninja cocktail \u201ccups\u201d from the bar and the industrial-style, dark wood-fitted space, everything about this spot\u2019s pretty darn\u00a0hip. On the menu are\u00a0Japanese small-plates like edemame hummus, cucumber-goma salar, tuna tartare\u00a0and\u00a0baos with bone marrow. In addition to these small dishes, dubbed\u00a0\u201cbirdfeed\u201d, Neon Pigeon also whips up some killer cocktails, including the Wasabi Drop and Yagi which is spiked with goat milk-washed gin.\nNeon Pigeon , #01-03, 1 Keong Saik Street, Singapore 089109\nBitters & Love\nPhotography: Bitters & Love via Facebook\nYou can throw out the menu because the boys at Bitters & Love will concoct something from the drink profile you provide. One drink they do really well is the kaya (coconut jam) toast cocktail, presented with bread and a dollop of kaya on top. Plus, a whimsical food menu makes sure you\u2019re never hungry\u00a0at this place, ever.\nBitters & Love , 118 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068587\nAnti:dote\nAnti:dote\u2019s selection of cleverly concocted cocktails would appeal to even the most discerning. Combining the artistry of classic cocktail-making with modern mixology, it only uses only premium spirits, house-made bitters and liqueurs, and herbs from the hotel\u2019s very own herb garden.\nAnti:dote , Level 1 Fairmont Singapore, 80 Bras Basah Road, Singapore 189560\nMartini Bar at Mezza9\nPhotography: Mezza9 via Facebook\nOffering over 50 different signature martinis, this swanky cocktail bar never fails to\u00a0give us a\u00a0case of decidophobia whenever we\u2019re there \u2013 we just end up telling them to surprise us! But if you prefer ordering straight from the menu, we recommend ordering the refreshing Lemon Basil.\nMartini Bar , Mezza9, Mezzanine Level, Grand Hyatt Singapore, 10 Scotts Road, Singapore 228211\nShin Gi Tai\nPhotography: Shin Gi Tai via Facebook\nWhen we heard Jigger and Pony\u2019s ex-bartender was opening Shin Gi Tai, we knew we\u00a0had to support. Known for his creative concoctions, Anthony Zhong will take\u00a0taste buds for a ride. The Japanese bar also has a list of unique drinks including a Hot Peanut Butter Rum with brown butter puree.\nTess Bar & Kitchen\nOver here, you can savour an\u00a0award-winning cocktail Clergyman Martini along with other creative concoctions. The bar also aims to be a platform for its team of young Asian mixologists to experiment and hone their craft, so you can expect nothing short of a casual, welcoming, and highly interactive experience.\nNutmeg & Clove\nPhotography: Nutmeg & Clove\nOozing old-world Oriental\u00a0glamour, this cocktail bar is adept at revitalising the traditional use of Asian herbs and spices, and introducing fresh flavour pairings to the discerning drinker.\nNutmeg & Clove , 10\u00a0Ann Siang Road, Singapore 069697\nManhattan Bar\nPhotography: Manhattan Bar via Facebook\nRegent Hotel\u2019s luxurious bar offers up a slice of 19th-century New York. Check out the world\u2019s first in-hotel rickhouse \u2013 a workshop space featuring over 100 American oak barrels of imported whisky\u00a0for experimentation. Manhattan also has a collection of unusual ingredients like wildcherry bark and shisandra berries\u00a0\u2013 and an amazing boozy Sunday brunch . And, if you\u2019re savvy with your bar buzz, you\u2019ll also know that Manhattan was voted the third best bar in the world back in 2018.\nManhattan , Regent Hotel, 2nd Floor, 1 Cuscaden Rd, Singapore 249715\nAh Sam Cold Drink Stall\nThis is not your regular kopitiam drink stall; it\u2019s a cosy bespoke cocktail bar opened by former Jigger & Pony bartender, Sam Wong. The lack of a menu means you have free reign to order anything you want, although we recommend trying Ah Sam\u2019s unique cocktails that incorporate local flavours like soya bean milk, Milo, and chin chow.\nThe Secret Mermaid\nPhotography: The Secret Mermaid via Facebook\nOperating as Japanese salad bar Shinkansen by day, The Secret Mermaid unveils its tail upon nightfall. It\u2019s easy to miss this speakeasy 16-seater bar, especially with its lack of signage, but keep your ears peeled for groovy beats, chatter, and distinctive clanking of glasses, and you\u2019ll know\u00a0you\u2019re in the right place. Bar owner Howard Lo (who also owns Standing Sushi Bar and Tanuki Raw) prefers to describe The Secret Mermaid as a tasting room, where guests can savour over 45 spirits in its booze library, most of which comes from small-batch distillery with names almost unheard of.\nThe Secret Mermaid (Shinkansen by day), B1-08, Ocean Financial Centre, 10 Collyer Quay, Singapore 049315\nWant the scoop on all things quarantine and chill?\n"

            "Southeastern Asia: Taiwan\nTaiwan, the largest island off the coast of China, is comprised of steep, granite mountains that rise on the eastern slope from a deep oceanic trench to nearly 4,000 m in elevation at the summit of Mt. Yushan. Because of the north-south alignment and the large vertical relief, Taiwan possesses a wide range of habitats and a correspondingly high biodiversity. A range of subtropical to subalpine forests still remain on mountain slopes while the coastal plains have been largely converted to agriculture. Taiwan\u2019s system of national parks and nature reserves offers a good measure of protection to the montane forests, while lowland and coastal areas would benefit from increased conservation measures.\nScientific Code\nLocation and General Description\nThe island of Taiwan is located about 200 km off the east coast of China. Most of the island is mountainous. Several ranges trend from northeast to southwest, and the highest peaks approach 4,000 m. The east side of the island rises steeply from the Pacific, while the west side includes some coastal plains that lie adjacent to the East China Sea. The mountains are high enough so that summits higher than 3,000 m receive some winter snow.\nTaiwan includes two ecoregions. Taiwan subtropical evergreen forests occupy most of the island while South Taiwan monsoon rainforests cover the southern tip. Of course, with 20 million people and a vigorous economy based on agriculture and industry, Taiwan\u2019s natural environments have been severely affected by people. Most of the natural habitat occurs in mountain areas where several nature reserves and national parks have been established. Today, forest cover is estimated to be about 52 percent of the total land area, although much of this consists of non-native tree plantations.\nTaiwan lies at the edge of the tropics and is washed by ocean currents that move north from the equator, creating a tropical monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 22oC and only about 10oC seasonal variation in temperature. Precipitation patterns vary across the length of Taiwan. The southern portion of the island receives most of its precipitation (about 2,900 mm a year) during the summer southwest monsoon from the South China Sea. The northern portion of the island, however, is affected by the northeast \"winter monsoon,\" and it receives most of its precipitation during winter. In general, the eastern slopes of the island receive the most rain (up to 6,000 mm annually) while the western plains receive only about 1,500 mm. Because Taiwan faces a great expanse of the tropical Pacific to the east, it is subject to intense typhoons.\nThe Taiwan subtropical evergreen forests are dominated by broadleaved species. But the island\u2019s topographic complexity means that many different forest types occur at different elevations on slopes of different aspect. MacKinnon et al. (1996) observed that these forests tend to form concentric rings around the island, like the lines on a topographic map, as elevation increases toward the interior. Despite this complexity, the overall forest zonation sequence seems to follow a pattern that re-occurs in mountain ranges throughout subtropical East Asia. As elevation increases, evergreen broadleaved forests are gradually replaced by deciduous hardwoods and conifers.\nHere, low elevation plains areas support monsoon evergreen broadleaved forests that are dominated by the chestnut, Castanopsis hystrix, and the laurel, Cryptocarya chinensis. Laurel-Castanopsis spp. forests are widely distributed across subtropical South Asia, forming climax forest associations throughout southern China and into the southern foothills of the Eastern Himalaya. The species, C. hystrix, itself is widely distributed; it extends clear across subtropical Asia as far west as Nepal. Some stands of the subtropical pine species Pinus massoniana also occur in this zone. Higher-elevation forests are dominated by the oak-like tree Cyclobalanopsis glauca.\nUpper temperate and subalpine forests occur at about 3,000 m. Here, deciduous hardwoods like alder (Alnus cremastogyne) and maple (Acer spp.). co-occur with hemlock (Tsuga chinensis). In the Eastern Himalaya as well, hemlock is a coniferous species transitional to the subalpine forest zone. At the highest elevations are stands of cold temperate (subalpine) coniferous forest dominated by Tsuga spp., Picea spp., and Abies spp.\nBiodiversity Features\nTaiwan has an extensive protected area network that includes both coastal and mountain habitats. However, as in many places throughout the world, the protected area network protects a higher proportion of habitat in montane areas than in the coastal lowlands, which have been densely settled and intensely farmed for many centuries. Both national parks and nature reserves are better demarcated and described here than they are in most of China. MacKinnon et al. (1996) provide a comprehensive account. A summary is provided here.\nSome of the larger protected areas include Yushan National Park (1,055 km2), Shei-Pa National Park (769 km2), and Taroko National Park (920 km2). Yunshan includes high mountains, mostly over 2,000 m. It supports rare mammals such as Taiwan muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi micrurus), Taiwan serow (Naemorhedus swinhoei), and Taiwan black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus formosanus) as well as the two pheasants endemic to Taiwan, the Mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado) and Swinhoe\u2019s pheasant (Lophura swinhoei). Shei-Pa is a relatively new national park, much of which is set aside for ecological protection rather than mountain tourism. It supports the endemic landlocked salmon (Oncorhynchus masou formosanum) and the Taiwan salamander (Hynobius formosanus). Tsenwen Estuary (3 km2) is a small nature reserve on Taiwan\u2019s Southwest Coast. It provides critical habitat for black-faced spoonbills (Platalea minor) and important wintering habitat for other waterbird species.\nTaiwan is an important endemic bird area (Stattersfield et. al. 1998) with 15 restricted-range species, the majority of which are forest birds that might have once inhabited lowland forests but are now restricted to upland mountain slopes. These include Mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado), collared bush-robin (Tarsiger johnstoniae), white-whiskered laughingthrush (Garrulax morrisonianus), and flamecrest (Regulus goodfellowi). Fairy pitta (Pitta nympha) is a widespread but threatened species (status: vulnerable), that occurs in Taiwan\u2019s subtropical forests.\nSpecies richness for plants and mammals is rather poor on Taiwan, although rates of endemism are higher than on the mainland. This follows the general pattern for an island. On Taiwan, 24 endangered plants occur, including the tree fern (Cyathea spinulosa) which has fibrous stems that are an ideal substrate for cultivating orchids. Taiwan supports a total of 48 mammal species, of which 7 are endemic. Two of these endemics, the Taiwan macaque (Macaca cyclopis) and Taiwan serow (Naemorhedus swinhoei), are first-class protected species.\nBird species richness is quite high. Fully 338 species have been recorded, 55 of which have protected status (9 first-class, 46 second-class), and 10 of which are endemic to the island. Of the first-class protected birds, two are endemic. Mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado) occur in middle-elevation montane forests at 2,000 to 3,000 m, and Swinhoe\u2019s pheasant (Lophura swinhoei) occur at lower elevation (900 to 2,100 m or higher). Both of these species are severely threatened because they are both ornamental and large enough to provide a good meal.\nOther threatened birds in Taiwan are coastal migratory species. Tsen Wen Estuary is the main wintering site of black-faced spoonbills (Platalea minor) and holds about 60 percent of the world\u2019s population. Short-tailed albatross (Diomedea albatrus) sometimes visit offshore islands like Diaoyu. Waders like Chinese egrets (Egretta eulophotes), Nordmann\u2019s greenshanks (Tringa guttifer), and Saunder\u2019s gulls (Larus saundersi) also winter here.\nThis high bird species richness likely results from several factors: high amounts of forest cover, diverse landscapes, near-tropical latitude, and Taiwan\u2019s position along the western Pacific coastal migratory routes.\nAdditional biodiversity includes an estimated 76 reptiles, 30 amphibians and 130 freshwater fish species. About 400 butterfly species have been recorded. Many of the larger, more colorful species are believed threatened by habitat destruction and commercial exploitation.\nCurrent Status\nTaiwan has been peopled for thousands of years. In recent centuries, the indigenous population has been augmented by waves of settlement from other areas of China so that the native Taiwanese are now greatly outnumbered by Chinese, mostly from the coastal provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. Because of the long history of human habitation, many Taiwanese are familiar with the useful resources found in their forests. These forests contain more than 300 economically important species, including figs, laurels and bamboo. Conifers such as Keteleeria fortunei, Chamaecyparis obtusa, and C. formosensis are used for timber. The camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) is another abundant, commercially valuable tree.\nTypes and Severity of Threats\nAltogether, Taiwan has a considerable number of coniferous taxa of conservation concern at the level of species and subspecies. There are 3 subspecies and 14 species placed in this category on the preliminary list of Fajon et al. (1993). The coniferous genera that occur in the mountains of Taiwan that include at least one threatened species are Cephalotaxus spp., Calocedrus spp., Chamaecyparis spp., Abies spp., Keteleeria spp., Picea spp., Pinus spp., Nageia spp., Podocarpus spp., Amentotaxus spp., Cunninghamia spp., and Taiwania spp.\nJustification of Ecoregion Delineation\nThis ecoregion was derived from broadleaf evergreen forests that dominate Taiwan (classes 21a, 22a, 20a) according to the CVMCC (1979) Vegetation Map of China. It also includes conifers (classes 8c, 4a) and double crop agriculture (74a,b) from the same source. These classes form a subset of Mackinnon\u2019s (1996) tropical Taiwan biogeographic region subunit (27).\nReferences\nChinese Vegetation Map Compilation Committee. 1979. Vegetation map of China.

            "Search this website\nDisclaimer: This post may contain affiliate links. All hosted affiliate links follow our editorial policies .\nWhen most people think of Thailand , they probably envision white sandy beaches, tasty tropical cocktails, stunning temples, and crumbling archaeological sites . They probably also conjure up images of delicious food and friendly people.\nThose were certainly the visions I had of Thailand before I visited the Southeast Asian nation. And thankfully, they all turned out to be true!\nBut, after three months of exploring the country, I ultimately realized that Thailand has a lot more to offer travelers than just gorgeous beaches , temples, and people.\nThere are also plentiful opportunities for getting up close to nature in some fantastic national parks, where the local wildlife comes front and center to the experience.\nTo that end, check out our picks for the best National Parks in Thailand, to give you an idea of what the country has to offer for nature lovers\u2026\nANG THONG MARINE NATIONAL PARK\nLocated near the famous island of Koh Samui, Ang Thong Marine National Park is an archipelago which consists of 42 islands in the southern part of Thailand.\nThis park has limestone islands, karst mountains , and other dramatic rock cliffs which rise from the sea.\u00a0You can explore caves , find hidden lagoons, and even go island-hopping to many different white sand beaches.\nAng Thong Park is a protected area with more than 100 square kilometers of land and sea. It can easily be visited on a day trip from Koh Samui on a speedboat, or you can join group tours on Thailand\u2019s famous long tail boats.\nIf you want to stay longer, there are simple bungalows and camping tents available on the main island, where the park headquarters is located.\u00a0There are many activities to do there, like snorkeling, Scuba diving , kayaking, hiking or even just relaxing on one of the beaches .\nOne activity you can\u2019t miss is to climb up to the park\u2019s scenic viewpoint, from which you can see most of the islands in the area. There are steps for the first few parts of the climb, and rest areas where you can stop to see the fantastic view along the way.\nThe climb can become a bit tough, especially on the last leg of the hike. But you\u2019ll definitely be rewarded with an awesome view from the top! \u2013Angie Ibarra of Travel Moments\nDOI INTHANON NATIONAL PARK\nThe northern part of Thailand is much cooler (temperature-wise) and hillier than the plains of the center or the beaches of the south.\nIt\u2019s here that the foothills to the massive peaks of the Himalayas begin. It is also where you can find Thailand\u2019s highest mountain\u2013 Doi Inthanon- which sits in the heart of\u00a0Doi Inthanon National Park.\nDoi Inthanon is home to fascinating micro-climates that you won\u2019t find anywhere else in Thailand. There are also hill tribes (who will welcome you to their villages with copious amounts of homegrown coffee ), gorgeous waterfalls, and superb hiking opportunities.\nThese include a 3-kilometer hike through a cloud forest and along the edge of the mountain, and a 1-kilometer nature trail through dense, moss coated forests. All of which are unforgettable ecotourism experiences. -Laurence Norah of Finding The Universe\nREAD MORE: 10 Best Mountains in the World (World Travel Bucket List)\nErawan National Park Thailand Waterfalls by Michael Meraner\nERAWAN NATIONAL PARK\nErawan National Park is located in the Kanchanaburi Province, west of Thailand\u2019s capital in Bangkok. The park was founded in 1975 and covers a total area of 550 square kilometers.\nErawan is one of the most visited national parks in Thailand, mostly thanks its main attraction, the Erawan Waterfalls.\u00a0The falls have seven tiers, which can be accessed with a short walk through the jungle of the park from the main parking area.\nThe national park can easily be visited on a day trip from Bangkok. If you have time, it is best to spend a night at Kanchanaburi and then head to the falls in the morning. You\u2019ll want to beat the crowds and have a much better experience.\nAt the fourth tier you\u2019ll find a large stone, from which you can slide into the clear water below. If you feel adventurous, you should definitely give it a try.\nWarning: Don\u2019t carry any food or water bottles on the outside of your bags and backpacks . There are numerous monkeys lurking in the treetops, and they will jump down to grab anything that looks remotely like a food item.\nBut don\u2019t worry: The monkeys are harmless, and nothing bad happens even if they do jump on you. It\u2019s all part of the adventure! \u2013Mike Meraner of 197 TravelStamps\nDugong by By Julien Willem via CC BY-SA 3.0 from Wikimedia Commons\nHAT CHAO MAI NATIONAL PARK\nIf you prefer your nature experience to be more of the bird- and sea-based variety, you\u2019ll want to head to Hat Chao Mai National Park.\nThe marine park is located down in the southwestern corner of Thailand, in the Trang Province\u00a0on the world-famous Andaman coast. Established in 1981, its 89 square miles include some impressive, protected coral reef systems.\nHere, the environmental conditions (which include vast expanses of sea grass and tidal mudflats) are perfect for both birds and aquatic animals, including the increasingly rare dugong.\nBeyond the national park, this area is also superb for enjoying empty beaches, gorgeous sunsets, and spicy southern Thai food. You can also go hopping amongst some of Thailand\u2019s least well-known and most beautiful islands. -Laurence Norah of Finding The Universe\nKHAO LUANG NATIONAL PARK\nIf you prefer your national parks to be of the largely unexplored variety, you\u2019ll love Khao Luang , which found in the southeastern corner of Thailand near the city of\u00a0Nakhon Si Thammarat.\nKhao Luang is home to the highest mountain in all of southern Thailand.\nThose stunning, 1,780-meter (5,840 feet) peaks mean that this park also offers\u00a0luscious forests and spectacular waterfalls . Some of them cascade over nearly 20 tiers on their way down the mountain!\nIt\u2019s warm enough here to swim in the pools, and the myriad flora and fauna you\u2019ll find in the park are fascinating.\nIn fact, it was here that I saw my first Orchid Mantis, a truly beautiful creature the likes of which I\u2019d never seen before! -Laurence Norah of Finding The Universe\nKHAO PHRA NATIONAL PARK\nLocated in Phuket, Khao Phra Thaeo National Park is the site of the only remaining virgin rainforest in Phuket and so much more.\nThis park is ideal for hikers, boasting numerous hiking trails of various lengths as well as several impressive waterfalls. Bang Pae is the largest waterfall in the Phuket area, while Ton Sai \u00a0is a smaller waterfall that\u2019s located near the park entrance.\nEntrance to the national park costs 200 THB (around $6.30 US), but is well worth it considering \u00a0the sheer number of hikes available to visitors.\nNumerous types of Asian wildlife can be seen in the park, such as langurs, deer, and monkeys. You\u2019ll also find more than 100 different bird species and countless trees. But the park is perhaps best known as the home of the world renowned Gibbon Rehabilitation Center.\nLocated near Bang Pae Waterfall, the center\u2019s goal is to rescue and rehabilitate injured and orphaned gibbons before returning them to their natural habitat. Visitors to the park can contribute to the project by visiting the center and donating.\nWith so many trails to visit, make sure to wear comfortable water shoes with a good gripping sole. Trekking uphill in sandals may not be the most comfortable option. -Anika Chaturvedi\nKHAO SOK NATIONAL PARK\nThere are many National Parks in Thailand that protect swathes of beautiful countryside and marine habitat. But Khao Sok National Park is among the most popular with visitors.\nOne of the main reasons is because of the park\u2019s easy accessibility. You can reach Khao Sok from coastal hotspots such as Phuket and Krabi as well as local airports at Phuket and Surat Thani, both of which are just over an hour from Bangkok.\nAlong with its lush green jungle and towering limestone mountains, Khao Sok National Park is best known for the man-made Cheow Lan Lake. This beautiful lake was formed in 1987 by the building of the Ratchaprapha Dam.\nThere\u2019s lots of wildlife to be spotted in the jungles of the national park, including several species of monkeys, deer, and birds. We particularly loved our visit to one of Thailand\u2019s most well-run ethical elephant sanctuaries, Elephant Hills .\nAnother huge attraction is the lake itself. Boat trips allow visitors to appreciate the beauty of the exceptionally clean and clear water (which appears emerald green in the sunlight) and the imposing limestone peaks.\nVisitors can stay overnight at many locations within the park, including a number of options in the forest. I personally loved our stay at a Cheow Lan Lake floating camp, with its tents built on decks that float at the lake\u2019s edge.\nSwimming and kayaking are the main activities here, as well as day hikes in the jungle. Floating in the cooling waters on a hot Thailand day was a magical experience we\u2019ll never forget. \u2013Kavita Favelle of Kavey Eats\nKHAO YAI NATIONAL PARK\nThe third largest national park in Thailand, Khao Yai features stunning grasslands and forests, which reminded me very much of Africa.\nIt\u2019s one of the few places in Thailand where Asian elephants can still be seen in the wild, and we were lucky enough to see some as part of a guided hike.\nYou can also take nighttime wildlife spotting tours, where you might see deer, wild pigs, porcupines, and more. The national park is also home to the rare Asiatic black bear and even tigers, although these are very difficult to spot!\nAlong with a number of surrounding parks (including Cambodia\u2019s Ta Phraya National Park), Khao Yoi is part of the UNESCO-listed Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai Forest Complex .\nThis nature-lover\u2019s wonderland covers 615,000 hectares and is home to over 800 different species of fauna. Around 20 of these are considered vulnerable, four are currently listed as endangered, and one is critically endangered. \u2013Laurence Norah of Finding The Universe\nKUI BURI NATIONAL PARK\nA highlight of any visit to Thailand, Kui Buri is another of Thailand\u2019s national parks that offers visitors good chances to see Asian elephants in the wild.\nHere, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to see elephants, none of which are subjected to harsh treatment or exploitation . Instead of being ridden or painting photos for tourists, you\u2019ll see these majestic animals herding as matriarchal families through evergreen forests and grasslands.\nYou\u2019ll also have a chance to see other rare species of Asian wildlife, including the bison-like gaur, Asian leopards, muntjacs, Malaysian tapirs, golden jackals, leopards, bantengs, and langurs.\nVisitors can take day-trip safaris though the park or camp overnight.\u00a0We recommend booking a guided tour, which will give you the best chance of spotting wildlife.\u00a0Local guides keep in contact with one another to share information on where animals have been spotted.\nIf you do self-drive, note that private vehicles are not allowed to pass beyond the Huai Leuk substation wildlife viewing area.\u00a0The best time to spot wildlife is the late afternoon. But you must enter the wildlife-watching areas before 5PM, and will be allowed to remain there until sunset.\nDue to strict conservation regulations, hiking is not allowed within the park at all. But short walks from vehicles to the wildlife viewing areas are permitted. \u2013Meg and Mike Jerrard of MappingMegan\nMU KHO LANTA NATIONAL PARK\nLocated on the southern tip of Koh Lanta in Thailand, Mu Koh Lanta National Park is the ultimate paradise for any wildlife and nature lover.\nBut it\u2019s not until you arrive on the island and ask around that you will really find out about this hidden gem. It actually includes several different islands (the biggest being Ko Lanta Noi and Ko Lanta Yai) which cover a total area of 134 square kilometers.\nFrom rugged hillsides and rainforest jungles to beautiful white-sand beaches, you\u2019ll find a little bit of everything in Mu Koh Lanta.\nHike some of the trails and you\u2019ll likely discover flowing waterfalls, or head out to some of the picturesque viewpoints overlooking the scenic coastline. You can also hang out with many different species of monkeys, or check out the impressive array of birds.\nThe popular Ta Noad Cape is home to a picturesque old lighthouse and gorgeous views of the Andaman Sea. The steep walk up to the lighthouse is also surrounded by 50-meter drops on either side down a jiggered cliff-side, so make sure you have good balance!\nThe entrance fee to Mu Koh Lanta National Park is 200 THB ($6.30) for foreigners and 100 THB ($3.15) for foreign children.\nThe park is open from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. daily, and there are camping opportunities available.\u00a0Just be aware that there are gates which get locked at 5 pm, so you will get stuck inside after hours.\nLastly, the park is located down a ridiculously steep incline. So if you are doubling up on a motorbike, one person will have to get off to walk so that the bike can get back up the hill! \u2013Tasha Amy of Backpackers Wanderlust\nAO PHANG-NGA NATIONAL PARK\nNo Thailand National Park tour would be complete without a visit to Ao Phang-Nga National Park, whose bay is considered among the country\u2019s most beautiful.\nThe area is famous as the home to those stunning limestone karst landscapes you\u2019ve seen in films like The Beach or the James Bond classic, The Man with the Golden Gun.\nSet in the calm green waters of Phang Nga Bay, exploring these island karsts by boat is a very popular activity, and one that I can wholeheartedly recommend.\nSure, you won\u2019t be alone (especially if you visit the tiny James Bond island). But the stunning scenery more than makes up for the crowds, with monkey-filled islands, hidden lagoons, and much more to explore\u2026 \u2013Laurence Norah of Finding the Universe\nSI LANNA NATIONAL PARK\nChiang Mai is an enchanting and beautiful city located in Northern Thailand. It\u2019s a bustling town \u00a0that has many strings to its bow, and one of the finest of those is Si Lanna National Park.\nWith an area of 1,406 square kilometres, Si Lanna National Park is an oasis of mountains and evergreen forest. Take a walk along any of its woodland paths and you\u2019ll be rewarded with the divine smells of frangipani and magnolia mingling in the coniferous forest.\nTeeming with wildlife, Si Lanna National park is home to a number of massive mammals, including the Tiger, Asiatic Black Bear, and Wild Boar.\nHidden within a small opening of the National Park is the Bua Tong Waterfall, which is otherwise known as the Sticky Waterfall.\u00a0These spectacular falls are supplied with fresh spring water containing a high amount of calcium carbonate.\nAs the water cascades over the rocks, calcium is deposited, adding a non-slip surface to the rocks. This means that you can literally walk up the fast-flowing waterfall without slipping. The experience is quite bizarre!\nThe Sticky Waterfalls are located along Highway 1001 about 45 minutes north of Chiang Mai. Stop at the superb local market along the way, which is located on the left-hand side of the road about 10 minutes before you get to the waterfall. Here you\u2019ll find an abundance of superb food for a picnic at super cheap prices. \u2013Liz Deacle of It\u2019s A Drama\nTARUTAO NATIONAL PARK\nTarutao National Marine Park is one of 22 underwater gems protected by the Thai Government. Located in the southern Satun Province, the park encompasses 51 different islands and nearly 1500 square kilometers of the Andaman Sea.\nThe park is home to a stunning array of wildlife, both above and below the surface of the ocean. Scientists estimate that more than 100 species of birds can be seen there, as well as wild boar, civets, and mouse deer.\nHowever, the park is probably most well known for its colorful soft corals and large schools of fish. In short, it\u2019s a great place for snorkeling and Scuba diving.\nMost visitors to Tarutao National Marine Park choose to stay on Ko Lipe, which is the only island in the Archipelago with substantial tourist facilities.\u00a0The DNP (Department of National Parks) also offers a few modest bungalows on Koh Adang, as well as camping on Koh Tarutao with rentable gear.\nThe park\u2019s 200 Baht ($6.30) entrance fee allows you access to many spectacular beaches and islands, most of which are relatively unexplored.\nThankfully, our favorite national park in Thailand remains largely off the tourist route. But the beautiful waters have gradually started to draw more visitors to this beautiful part of the country. \u2013Hannah & Adam Lukaszewicz of Getting Stamped\nGreen Global Travel is the world's #1 independently owned ecotourism website encouraging others to embrace sustainable travel, wildlife conservation, cultural preservation, and going green tips for more sustainable living.\nWe've been spotlighted in major media outlets such as the BBC, Chicago Tribune, Forbes, The Guardian, Lonely Planet, National Geographic, Travel Channel, Washington Post and others.\nOwned by Bret Love (a veteran journalist/photographer) and Mary Gabbett (business manager/videographer), USA Today named us one of the world's Top 5 Travel Blogging Couples.

Aptly so, as the fa\u00e7ade bears an uncanny resemblance to Batman\u2019s fictional hometown.\nThe Art Deco interiors have also inspired a bar that has taken residence in the building\u2019s lobby: Atlas .

            "Home \u00bb 15 Most BEAUTIFUL Cafes In Singapore That Are Perfect For Lazy Afternoons\n15 Most BEAUTIFUL Cafes In Singapore That Are Perfect For Lazy Afternoons\nLarge plush armchairs, plenty of sunlight, cozy alcoves to nestle in and plenty of good tea \u2013 these spots are great for chilling with a riveting book.\n05 August 2019\nHello, glorious weekend!\nWe love our cafes. Cafes with great coffee, cafes that serve up beautiful brunches and bottomless mimosas , and chic new cafes that the cool crowd flocks to.\nBut we have a special place in our heart for the cafes that make the perfect hideaway nook to burrow in and laze your weekend away in quiet bliss.\nSo we combed through all the places we know and came up with there gorgeous cafes that you\u2019ll want to stay at all day with a pot of tea and that one book you\u2019ve been meaning to read for the longest time.\nStart planning your weekend with our cafe guide.\nPrevious\nNext\n1. Little House of Dreams\nThis\u00a0unabashedly girly\u00a0cafe is decked in fairy lights, pink and white paper flowers, and even striped awnings over the cashier.\nIt\u2019s definitely not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but if you adore this\u00a0cutesy aesthetic, Little House of Dreams is definitely for you.\nWhat we love most about this cafe are the little semi-secluded areas where you can feel like you have some time alone to yourself. Like the little alcoves with floral patterned seats, and armchairs put behind white picket fences where you can curl up with your book.\nBlock 8 Dempsey Rd,\u00a0247696\n2. Birds of a Feather\nYou wouldn\u2019t think it, but Birds of a Feather \u2013 this pretty-as-a-picture cafe with ethereal cloud lamps, verdant walls of\u00a0ferns, and skylights has an unexpected streak to it.\nYou won\u2019t find any\u00a0eggs benedict\u00a0or croissants here, but instead contemporary\u00a0Sichuan fare.\nStill, you can grab some teas and tisanes at the bar to sip on while reading. Perhaps some cucumber mint or white pear ginger to\u00a0complement a serving of Asian spice poached pear? Mmm.\n115 Amoy St,\u00a0069935\n3. Antoinette\nAntoinette during weekday tea-times is a lovely quiet space to get some reading done. Not only can you sit back with a pot of tea, you should also try their\u00a0creative and refreshed new menu \u2013\u00a0an exciting range of 5 creations of Antoinette\u2019s Souffle Pancakes \u2013 both savoury and sweet, including a bubble tea, as well as a Singapore-inspired flavour.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, a renewed French bistro-style all-day menu with new savoury items.\nThe space\u00a0is ornate, decorated with large velvety, Victorian-style chairs, vintage frames, candelabras and even a fireplace to boot. But everything has a worn-down quality to it, giving the\u00a0place a welcoming charm.\nJust be sure to go when it\u2019s not that crowded, as it can get noisy during lunch and dinner times when Antoinette is usually full.\n30 Penhas Rd, 208188\n4. Arteastiq\nThis pretty tea lounge and\u00a0art jamming\u00a0space in\u00a0Mandarin Gallery already has a bit of a rep for being a spot for tai tais, thanks to its refined look.\nAnd while it is pretty to look at, with a mod-victorian decor style and lush trees filling the floor-to-ceiling glass panels, the teas are definitely worth trying.\nIn addition to the usual\u00a0high tea sets\u00a0which feature\u00a0fruit and floral teas as well as Chinese and Japanese teas, there are also \u2018tea\u2019tox beverages like the Honey Lavender Tea which comes with a sprig of organic lavender in the cup \u2013 which helps infuse the aroma of lavender even more.\nThe one that piques our interest the most though is the dessert tea \u2018Lady Yang\u2019, a lychee tea you pour over a skewer of saccharine lychees\u00a0dusted in rose powder. Yum.\n333A Orchard Rd,\u00a0238897\n5. My Art Space\nPart art school, part cafe, My Art Space is great to hang out at when it\u2019s a sunny day.\nWhy? The ample\u00a0sunlight that streams in through the skylights and glass walls as well the surrounding greenery from Istana Park make you feel like you\u2019re away from the city though you\u2019re in the heart of it.\nWalk past the studio where art students will give you\u00a0serious painting\u00a0inspo, before entering the cafe to find a cloudy glass floor\u00a0that shows glimpses of the fountain the building is perched on.\nThen choose a simple cup of Gryphon tea from a cutesy palette-shaped menu before settling down in a corner. Beautiful location that\u2019s unpretentious and\u00a0fuss-free. We think you\u2019ll like it here.\n31 Orchard Rd,\u00a0238888\n6. The Reading Room\nReading sanctuary with high tea sets and quintessential cafe nosh by day,\u00a0bustling bar\u00a0with tapas, wine, small-batch ciders, and cocktails by night. You pick the kind of scene you want.\nWhat about us? We\u2019d happily stay here from day to night. There\u2019s an endearing mess to this place. Random knick-knacks are strewn around; an assortment of wooden chairs, upholstered seating and stools are clustered around small tables; and pictures bordered in vintage frames fill any wall space that isn\u2019t already covered with rows of books.\nBring your own book\u00a0or make a gamble and find one to read from The Reading Room itself.\n19 Bukit Pasoh Rd, 089833\n7. Mellower Coffee\nWe picked Mellower for the ambience and view. There\u2019s bean bags on the second floor if you want to kick back; barstools and tables which overlook the street crossing so you can people watch while you take a break from reading.\nAlso, we think Mellower deserves brownie points for presentation. Your drink comes with a petite vase of fresh and\u00a0colourful blooms\u00a0\u2013 a nice accessory for a flatlay.\n108 Middle Rd,\u00a0188967\n8. Looksee Looksee\nThis tiny tea salon and reading room located between the bars and cafes along Beach Rd is a hidden gem you\u2019re not likely to notice till you\u2019re actually in front of it. Painted in likable tones of millennial pink\u00a0and stone beige, with the occasional cacti and fern to\u00a0add splashes of pine green, we feel we\u2019re in an Insta picture when we\u2019re here. There are books on F&B, art and design you can read about, but unless you\u2019re into those kinds of things we recommend you\u00a0bring your\u00a0own book.\nA small, selection of teas curated by A.muse, a local handcrafted tea purveyor,\u00a0is available, and you can pay as much as you want for it\u00a0\u2013 as long as you pay a minimum of $5 per pot. Come here if you\u2019re down for some intense reading. When we visited on a weekday afternoon, it was so quiet we felt like we were in a library!\n267 Beach Rd,\u00a0199545\n9. Plain Vanilla Bakery\nIn the hipster enclave of Tiong Bahru, Plain Vanilla \u2018s known for some\u00a0really good cupcakes.\nPair the sweet treat with some loose leaf tea and settle down in the open storefront which has its look changed from time to time. The last time we saw it, there\u2019s a wooden swing, wooden tables that are close to the ground, carpet grass, and pretty bicycles with cane baskets on the front that you can rent for a\u00a0quick and fun cardio session. ($10 for one hour, $18 for two hours, and $20 for three hours.)\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but we\u2019re getting mod-kampung vibes, and we love it.\n1D Yong Siak St,\u00a0168641\n10. Mercure Singapore Bugis\nIf you want to head somewhere a little more central (or don\u2019t really wanna sit on the ground), try Mercure Singapore Bugis and indulge in Asian desserts\u00a0like pandan creme brulee and golden durian pillows.\nThe lobby is\u00a0nice to hang out at, but\u00a0if you\u2019re doing a staycation, take your book and tea up to the pool, so you can dip your toes in the water while having a view of the town.\n122 Middle Rd,\u00a0188973\n11. The Rabbit Hole\nThe Rabbit Hole \u2013 you may have seen it pop up on your feed, with your friends standing at the distinct hole-shaped entrance \u2013 is a garden bar that specialises in gin.\nWhile you can order a pot of tea, we don\u2019t see anything wrong in indulging in a\u00a0glass of gin\u00a0topped with flowers, fruits or herbs to counter the heat when reading alfresco.\nOr you could take it inside and sit at the stunning bar that\u2019s draped in greenery while you\u00a0watch the bartender\u00a0fix a drink for you.\n39C Harding Rd,\u00a0249541\n12. Wildseed Cafe\nWildseed Cafe is a must go if you\u2019re a nature lover. That\u2019s because\u00a0the retail partners of Wildseed Cafe, Poppy Flora and Nature Studio, are a part of the reason why the cafe stays so impeccably decorated with a beautiful mix of foliage and\u00a0flower arrangements.\nIf you\u2019d like, you could sip on an original cocktail that has been\u00a0made using fresh herbs from the nearby garden. Pretty neat.\n3 Park Ln,\u00a0798387\n13. Tea Bone Zen Mind\nWhen you step past the nondescript wooden door of the\u00a0shophouse where Tea Bone Zen Mind is located, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve stepped into a different area entirely.\nInstead of a home or regular shop, you\u2019ll find a koi pond, cushioned seating areas to sip tea at, and\u00a0an overall zen atmosphere.\nVenture up the wooden stairs, and you\u2019ll see private tea rooms that are reminiscent of a traditional Japanese tatami room. It really doesn\u2019t feel like Singapore anymore, and we recommend Tea Bone Zen Mind for times when you want to\u00a0escape it all.\n98 Emerald Hill Rd,\u00a0229374\n14. The Coastal Settlement\nYou\u2019d be reminded of\u00a0old-school\u00a0Singapore at The Coastal Settlement . Smooth cement floors, blue and white china in rickety wooden cabinets, and tonnes of retro memorabilia that line the shelves all remind people of simpler times.\nWe like the inside-most part of the cafe a lot\u00a0\u2013 where you\u2019ll find lots of big armchairs and floor-to-ceiling glass panels that show you the tropical greenery outside.\nIt feels a little bit like a\u00a0chalet\u00a0with an old-school charm, so if that wins you over more than elegant tea rooms, The Coastal Settlement is for you.\n200 Netheravon Rd,\u00a0508514\n15. Atlas Bar\nAtlas is known for being the best gin bar in Singapore, not to mention\u00a0one of the best bars in the world. You\u2019ll find an incredible selection of rare and gins, wines, and whiskeys in the collection. But did you know that this regal looking bar also serves fine teas?\nTry the Atlas afternoon tea set along with the Atlas art deco tea blend which incorporates dry gin botanicals, elderflower and yuzu. You\u2019ll also get moreish canapes to snack on as part of the set. We love hanging at Atlas because of the\u00a0intricate design and art\u00a0\u2013 it feels like we\u00a0discover a new detail each time we return!\nOn a side note, you might want to make a reservation before heading down, unless you\u2019re going on a weekday afternoon, when there isn\u2019t much of a queue.\n600 North Bridge Rd,\u00a0188778\nPrevious\nNext\nBy Sara Mahendran, April 2018, Her World Singapore / Updated by Melodi Ghui, August 2019\nMore on The Finder:\nYou May Also Like\nLatest\nHighlights\nWatch This!\nMost Popular\nThis error message is only visible to WordPress admins\nWarning: The account for thefindersingapore needs to be reconnected.\nDue to Instagram platform changes on March 31, 2020, this Instagram account needs to be reconnected to allow the feed to continue updating.

            "Must Try Restaurants In KL \u2013 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nby Maria Wulff Hauglann Last updated on October 23, 2019 25 comments\nDear Reader: We may get commissions for purchases made through links in this article, at no extra cost to you. This helps keep the site running and free for all. Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f\nAre you going to Kuala Lumpur and wondering where to eat KL? Don\u2019t worry, you will not go hungry in KL as the city is a real foodies heaven where you can eat and dine all day and night. In KL you will find everything from high-class restaurants worthy of a Michelin Star (if they ever decide to cover Malaysia), to street stalls selling freshly cooked local delights at a low price.\nThere are so many things to do in Kuala Lumpur , and trying out the local food is high up on the list. In KL the locals greet each other with \u201cSudah makan?\u201d = \u201cHave you eaten yet?\u201d instead of the more common \u201cHow are you?\u201c, which really says it all. \ud83d\ude42\nYou can find food from every corner of Asia in this city, and a mix between them all which sums of what the Malaysian cuisine is all about; a mix of Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanse, and Thai food.\nIt is entirely safe to eat in local restaurants in Kuala Lumpur as the food is fresh, the raw ingredients are top-notch, and the meals prepared to a high hygienic standard. A bonus is that the prices are low, and everyone speaks English so you can ask about the ingredients and get recommendations. So step out among the many delicious street food hawkers and street restaurants and indulge yourself in all the delights!\nSince there are so many restaurants, hawker stalls and Kopitiam (coffee shops) in this city, it can be difficult to find the best places to eat in KL, those that serve mouth-watering food where also the locals go.\nHere we give you what we think are the best restaurants in KL. These are not necessarily the poshest restaurants or the most expensive ones, but restaurants that are charming, authentic, conveniently located in popular areas of KL and most importantly serve delicious Malaysian food.\n13 Must-Try Restaurants In KL\nMap: The 13 best restaurants in Kuala Lumpur (in our opinion\u2026)\nMany of the cafes in KL are \u201cKopitiam\u201d meaning coffee shops, which serve local dishes and hot and cold beverages like Teh Tarik, coffee, and juices.\nFamiliar dishes at traditional Kopitiam are noddle and rice-based, and they often serve traditional all-day breakfast consisting of a half-hard-boiled egg and toast with kaya (coconut jam). Espen is not a huge fan of this breakfast, while I think it\u00b4s quite good actually. \ud83d\ude42\nA restauran (meaning restaurant) in KL, is usually everything from casual old Chinese or Malay restaurants where they serve traditional dishes to posh upscale restaurants that also serve international or fusion dishes.\n1. Limapulo\nBaba, the fantastic owner of Limapulo Restaurant\nEverything is just perfect at this restaurant \u2013 the food, the service, the interior, and the lovely outdoor area in the front.\nWe go here on all our KL trips, often several times, and we always get greeted by the famous and smiling \u201cBaba\u201d or Uncle John which is in his mid-70s and the man behind the\u00a0cooking in this restaurant. He started this restaurant together with his godson.\nThe restaurant\u2019s tagline is \u201cBaba can cook,\u201d and I totally agree, he really can! \ud83d\ude42 Baba usually sits in his chair outside of the entrance to the restaurant.\nIf you can, come here on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday when they serve their famous and super delicious Nyonya Laksa. Mmmm, it\u2019s the best!\u00a0\u2665\nLimapulo is definitely among one of the best restaurants in KL and has won many awards.\nThe famous Laksa dish at Limapulo Restaurant\nWe have tried and recommend the following dishes at Limapulo:\nNyonya Laksa\nNoodles in a spicy soup with boiled eggs, tofu, and different vegetables. Only served on Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday.\nBerempah (RM 19)\nEspen\u2019s no. 1 favorite. A variant of Rendang Chicken. Or choose the Set Menu Ayam Berempah where you get rice too (a better deal price-wise).\nSate (RM 14,90)\nMixed meat skewers of barbecued chicken and beef with a delicious sauce.\nRoti Jala (RM 9,90)\nNyonya Fried Mee Hoon (RM 9,90)\nNoodles with chicken, shrimps, egg, vegetables.\nBendi Kukus (RM 15)\nA stew of chicken, potatoes, vegetables in a delicious sauce.\nNyonya Curry (RM 19)\nLooks a bit like Chicken Berempah but not quite as good.\nSago Gula Melaka (RM 3,50)\nLovely dessert! Sago pudding with palm sugar.\nCendol (RM 3,50)\nA very popular Malay dessert consisting of green worm-like sweet noodles/ jelly of rice or bean flour. Not my favorite.\nSatay at Limapulo\nLove the design at Limapulo\nThe Row\nLimapulo is part of a stretch of excellent restaurants and cafes called The Row . The restaurants are located in old renovated heritage houses.\nThe whole street (Jalan Doraisamy) has a great, relaxed and hip atmosphere. Besides Limapulo, the neighboring French restaurant 2OX Bistro which serves fantastic and authentic French food with set menu deals for both lunch and dinner that is a good value. We fell in love with their creme brulee!\nAnother cozy place is The Common Grind , a cafe selling great coffee, tea, juices, and pastries. Here you can also bring your laptop and do some work/ surfing.\nThe Row \u2013 a street packed with nice restaurants and cafes\nThere is also a cool and hip weekend market at The Row, called the Sunny Side Up Market where local artists and entrepreneurs sell different handmade pieces of jewelry, clothes, handbags, shoes, snacks, drinks, wine, \u00a0and so on. I love this market and wanted to buy so much which sadly I couldn\u2019t since I only had limited space in my backpack. \ud83d\ude41\nAddress: 50, Jalan Doraisamy, Kuala Lumpur (close to Hotel Stripes and Sheraton Hotel)\nHow to get there: Take the light green no. 8 Monorail to Medan Tuanku station, or red no. 5 LRT Kelana Jaya Line to Dang Wangi, and walk from there (very short).\nOpening hours: 12:00 \u2013 15:00 & 18:00 \u2013 22:00. Closed on Sundays.\n2. Kafe Old Market Square\nLocated close to the famous and beautiful Masjid Jamek Mosque, this old Kopitiam/ cafe from 1906 is clean and newly restored. It has kept the original wall tiles and mosaic floors which is pretty cool. Together with the old historical photos framed on the walls, it oozes old heritage. The cafe is in the corner shophouse of three houses in a row, all built by tin magnate Loke Yew.\nKafe Old Market Square\nThe entrance to Kafe Old Market Square\nThe Kafe Old Market Square has a big menu, so there is plenty of options.

Here you can find plenty of excellent accommodation on any budget. \u00a0Below are some of our favorites at different price ranges.\nBeautiful colonial decor at the Majestic Hotel\nBuilt in 1932 as Kuala Lumpur\u2019s first luxury hotel, The Majestic has been host to royals and celebrities. A massive restoration project finished in 2012, and today it perfectly mixes old-world luxury with modern five-star comforts.\nRarely have we been met with such genuine warm service and smiles. Staying at the Majestic is a unique experience in its self.\nThe sparkling Petronas Towers\nWith arguably the city\u2019s best view of the world-famous Petronas Towers and with KLCC park as its closest neighbor the Traders Hotel\u2019s location is just unbeatable!\nIts famous Skybar on the 33rd floor is a cool place to hang out and enjoy a drink. The rooms are large and comfortable with floor-to-ceiling windows but could do with a little refresher. But the view, oh that view\u2026\nAwesome rooftop infinity pool and bar at Hotel Stripes\nHotel Stripes is a new hotel (2017) that impressed us in every way. We loved the stylishly and ultra-comfortable rooms with small touches like the free refill of soft drinks and water, and the rooftop infinity pool and bar with its spectacular view of KL Tower.\nLocated just a few minute walk away from the Dang Wangi subway station and the Medan Tuanku monorail station, it is also a great base from which to explore the city. Hotel Stripes is our favorite hotel in the downtown of the city.\nThe reception at KL Journal Hotel\nKL Journal is our favorite mid-range hotel in the Bukit Bintang area. This cozy boutique hotel is located on a quiet side street yet you are just a few minute walk away from world-class shopping and entertainment, delicious street food, tons of restaurants and nightlife.\nThe newly restored infinity rooftop swimming pool and bar area is a lovely place to relax.\nThe huge swimming pool at Lansons Place\nIf you\u2019re looking for an apartment, then Lanson Place is tough to beat. Large, modern and fully equipped apartments within an easy walking distance of Bukit Bintang.\nThe swimming pool is enormous, and there are a children\u2019s pool and playground, as well as a well-equipped fitness center.\nBreathtaking views from the rooftop pool at Capri by Fraser Hotel\nWe keep returning to The Capri hotel and it has over the years become our favorite KL hotel. It is located in a quiet upscale residential area in Bangsar South just a 10-minutes train ride from KL Central.\nHere things move a little slower and provide a nice escape from the hectic city, yet there are plenty of excellent restaurants and shopping malls around.\nThe apartments are huge and modern, and there are both studio and one/ two/three-bedroom apartments available.

These restaurants have some of the best options for you. From Thai to European, you are bound to be satisfied.\nby Joy Fang & Michelle Lee / December 10, 2019\nPhoto: Unsplash\nDining in Singapore is expensive enough. Plus, there are so many choices. When it comes to fine dining, we want something really out-of-this-world\u2026 And we have a soft spot for places that offer true value for money (read: no miniscule, dainty portions that leave you hankering for a Big Mac after).\nHey, it gets us to come back more than once a year. Here are the places that tick all the boxes when it comes to fine dining at a great price.\n1. Tamarind Hill\nPhoto: Facebook / Tamarind Hill\nThis charming restaurant nestled in a colonial building is a gem for those who want an intimate meal in a rustic environment. Hidden away atop the forested Labrador Nature Reserve, it serves Thai and Shan cuisine with a luxe and contemporary twist.\nDishes are pricier than at a normal Thai restaurant , but dishes are hearty and full of flavour, and worth every cent, especially if you\u2019re up for sharing.\nAppetisers range from $14 to $28, mains from $22 to $58 and desserts from $14 to $24.\nBut to get the best value, go for the restaurant\u2019s leisurely Sunday Brunch ($60++ per person or $120++ with free flow beverages) where you can order as much as you please off a set menu, including dishes such as red curry with pork, duck with lychee salad and deep fried tiger prawns with salted egg sauce. Its TGIF set lunch is at $48++ and nabs you an\u00a0ice cold Chang Beer or house wine along with the chef\u2019s signature creations.\nTamarind Hill is at 30 Labrador Villa Rd, tel:\u00a06278 6364.

Its value comes from the fact that the dishes are so out of the ordinary that they are a delight to try.\nTake the Szechuan-style tortellini ($16 for three), which consists of heavenly parcels of Kurobuta pork wrapped in handmade skin soaked in a broth of Sichuan chilli and Zhejiang vinegar before they are topped with frothy chilli oil foam.\nOr go for the Poulet De Bresse ($35), a quirky play on French cuisine, which comprises a crispy roulade of French chicken thigh that is marinated with\u00a0nu er hong\u00a0and stuffed with creamy foie gras.\nGet more from your dollar by getting the 4-course lunch set ($48++) that comes with an appetizer or soup and a main, staple, and dessert.\nXin Divine is at 10 Duxton Hill, tel:\u00a03100 0030.

            "Let me guess. You\u2019re fresh out of university, raring to start your career, and\u00a0you think you\u2019re financially savvy enough to dabble in stocks and shares. You\u2019re ready to rake it in \u2014 but then you start checking out DBS Vickers, UOB Kay Hian, POEMS\u2026 and realise that there are an overwhelming number of options when it comes to investment brokerage firms in Singapore.\nWell, it takes careful consideration of several factors like the commission fees, trading platform and account type. We urge you to pick wisely: It could make all the difference between whether you\u2019re just breaking even or if you\u2019re actually going to make money from your adventure on the stock market.\nHere are 3 main factors you need to look out for when choosing the best brokerage firm for you:\n1. How much is the commission? Comparison of investment brokerage fees\nInvestment brokerage firms allow you to buy and sell shares on the stock market, and\u00a0they charge commission fees for each transaction you make. When you buy shares, you get charged. When you sell shares, you also get charged. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always important to find out how much commission fee a brokerage firm charges you.\nHere\u2019s a list of the more popular brokerage firms in Singapore and their fees for small-time investors (up to $50,000 in investments; it\u2019s usually cheaper for larger amounts).\nInvestment Brokerage Firm\nMinimum Fee\n0.28%\n$25\nCDP\nAll trading fees listed are based on online/mobile trades done in the Singapore market. They exclude other charges like the clearing fee, SGX trading fee and GST.\nIf you\u2019re the kind of investor to just \u201cpark\u201d your money and not think twice about it, commission fees won\u2019t make much of a difference to you.\u00a0But most investors want to buy low and sell high, and so should expect to be charged commission fees multiple times. If this is you, then it is more important to pick one that charges affordable rates.\nDepending on how much you\u2019re planning to invest, you could also be caught by the minimum fees. This refers to the minimum commission charged, regardless of how little you\u2019re trading. If you\u2019re a regular small-time investor trading in $1,000s rather than $10,000s, it might not even matter how much the commission fee is by percentage \u2014 you would be more interested in choosing a broker with the lowest minimum fee instead.\nIn general, the lower the transaction amount, the more expensive the commission.\u00a0For small-time investors, you should be trading at least $10,000 per transaction if you want to avoid paying the minimum fee, which will end up being a much higher percentage of your trade than if you were to trade higher.\nOf course, while fees are an important consideration, they should not be your only deciding factor\u2026\n2. What\u2019s this \u201cprepaid\u201d thing all about? The significance of CDP account vs custodian account\nIt\u2019s glaringly obvious that the investment brokerages offering the lower fees fall under the \u201ccustodian\u201d category in the 4th column of the table.\nIt also looks like some of Singapore\u2019s more traditional investment brokers, like POEMS and Maybank, are now offering a cheaper commission fee if you opt for a \u201cprepaid\u201d or \u201cprefunded\u201d account. What gives!?\nWell, it turns out that a growing number of investment brokers are feeling the heat from online brokerages like SAXO Markets , who are able to offer way cheaper commission fees.\nAs a result, they are now offering competitive \u201cprepaid\u201d rates, which you can enjoy if you pre-deposit cash into your trading account. Your trades will be limited to your account balance, so you have to keep this account funded if you want to continuously trade.\nImportantly, these prefunded accounts also mean that your stocks are typically held in a custodian account instead of the usual CDP account.\nThis is in contrast to the CDP (Central Depository) account model normally offered. What this means is that while you buy and sell stocks through investment firms, the stocks themselves are held by you, via your CDP account.\u00a0We\u2019ll talk more on how to open a CDP account later.\nInvesting through the non-CDP route, on the other hand, means that\u00a0the custodian account (e.g. SAXO) owns the stocks on your behalf. So you may not have the full shareholder rights to your stocks, such as attending AGMs or voting rights.\nFurthermore, on the very slim chance that the investment brokerage firm goes bankrupt, you may have trouble regaining your stocks because they are technically not in your name.\nMost brokerages assure clients that custodian accounts\u00a0are kept separate and will not be affected should the company be insolvent or go into liquidation. But still, there\u2019s a slightly higher risk compared to owning the stocks directly.\nThe one exception is DBS Vickers\u2019 Cash Upfront account, which is the best of both worlds: It has the low fees associated with prefunded accounts, but stocks are held in CDP in your name. However, the low fees are only for buying stocks. If you want to sell, you\u2019ll be charged the usual DBS Vickers (much higher) commission fees.\nTL;DR: CDP = higher commission fees, but you own the shares directly. Custodian account = cheaper fees, but shares are not in your name.\n3. What is the investment brokerage\u2019s trading platform like?\nIn the past, many trades required investors to call their brokers and deal with them directly. Furthermore, they had to rely on stock prices and other information that may not be updated instantaneously. Those days are long gone.\nBrokerage firms these days offer online trading platforms that allow you to check stock prices and make trades on the go. Some even have mobile apps.\nNaturally, you would want to pick an investment broker with an accessible and user-friendly online trading platform. If you can\u2019t trade online with ease, then what is even the point? Might as well join the line at Phillip Capital. Plus, the commission fees for online trading are usually a lot cheaper than traditional offline trading.\nBefore you commit to a specific investment broker, make sure you test out their platform to see if it\u2019s something you\u2019d be happy using time and again. If it\u2019s buggy, doesn\u2019t display the right information, and doesn\u2019t have the tools that you need \u2014 forget it, there are other fish in the sea.\nOn the other hand, a too-user-friendly online platform might also bring out the worst in us. Make sure you don\u2019t become addicted to watching stock prices going up and down and getting all kinds of stressed \u2014 we already have social media for that.\nIn case you need it: Here\u2019s how to open a CDP Account\nIf you have decided on an investment brokerage that lets you own stocks via CDP, then you\u2019ll need to set up a CDP securities account .\nTo be eligible to open an account, you need to be at least 18 years old and NOT an un-discharged bankrupt. You can either do this directly with The Central Depository (it\u2019s a very straightforward process) or create a sub-account with a \u201cDepository Agent\u201d \u2013 a stockbroking firm, trust company or bank nominee.\nBasically, while you can deal with as many different brokerage firms as you want, you only need to open one CDP securities account to deposit all the stocks you\u2019ve bought.\nBonus: Investment brokerage fees for US stock market\nApart from letting you buy and sell shares on SGX, all the investment brokerages we talked about also extend the same services in major overseas stock exchanges. So if you\u2019re looking to invest in overseas stock markets in the future, it\u2019s worthwhile to check your broker\u2019s commission fees for them.\nCommission fees and minimums are different for each stock market, so I\u2019m going to pick out just the fees for US stock markets (typically you can trade on NYSE and NASDAQ, sometimes AMEX too):\nInvestment Brokerage Firm\n0.3%\nUS$20\nCitibank\n0.3%\nUS$25\nIf you\u2019re trading in overseas stock markets, note that the whole CDP vs custodian account thing doesn\u2019t matter. The Central Depository is only for trades on SGX, and is not an option if you\u2019re buying, say, Amazon stock or an S&P 500 ETF on a US exchange. Your stocks will be held in a custodian account by default.\nIn addition to these commission fees, be aware of additional fees which vary from market to market. For example, in the US there is an SEC fee for selling shares, while different taxes or foreign exchange fees may apply elsewhere.\nDo you have any other advice for new investors who want to try out a brokerage firm?

            "| On 11 months ago\n10 Places In Singapore To Escape To For Some Ultimate People-Free Alone Time\n\u2013Places To Say \u2018FTS\u2019!\u2013\nLow-EQ colleagues, pestiferous clients and your self-absorbed boyfriend often make you need some peace and quiet. But then it\u2019s 11pm and your impetuous neighbours are now equipped with Popsicals that allow them to (in)conveniently karaoke anywhere, anytime!\nSo, for those of you who really need to get rage out of your system, this category is on its own because apparently, hurling things at walls and breaking stuff in public isn\u2019t cool. And for thy sanity (because that\u2019s totally what FTS stands for), you may need to go destroy sh*t.\n1.\u00a0The Fragment Room\nWe saw how excited y\u2019all got about Singapore\u2019s first room for mass destruction. For some extra damage, check in to see if you can bring your (soon-to-be) ex\u2019s box of stuff with you.\nForget long deep breaths, and calming strolls along Singapore\u2019s park-connectors. When you feel like breaking something, there is nothing more satisfying than actually breaking something \u2013 especially if that something is a karaoke set that you can pretend belongs to your neighbours.\nHere\u2019s the bad news: It\u2019s pricey and IRL (in real life) you haven\u2019t actually destroyed your neighbours\u2019 karaoke nights. But the good news? This is the priciest option I\u2019ve got for you on this list.\nPrice:\u00a0$38 (30mins)\u00a0to $220 (6omins)\nThe Fragment Room: 3 Balestier Road, Singapore 329671\u00a0| Opening Hours: 1pm \u2013 10pm (Daily) | Tel: +65 6291 1519 | Website | Facebook | Bookings\n\u2013Places To Unwind\u00a0With Animals\u2013\nAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about animal shelters, because you\u2019ll find yourself making it a group activity, and this list is supposed to be particularly nice for going in it solo.\u00a0Now, I don\u2019t always have $200 lying around to go see my therapist for an hour, so if there is one thing I am morally obligated to share, it\u2019s probably how I have kept myself alive.\nSince the 1970s, a wealth of research has proven that being with animals has shown to increase levels of Oxytocin \u2013 the hormone that facilitates happiness and which also directly affects the body\u2019s state of readiness to heal. So, here\u2019s your \u201cIn Case Of Emergency\u201d option, for the days where you\u2019re battling an existential crisis.\n2. Riding For Disabled Association (RDA)\nLittle Miss Sunshine enjoying some paddock time\nAnyone in equestrian will tell you there is nothing more calming than walking into the smell of fresh hay and shavings, and noticing an absence of bustle. You\u2019ll get that chance too, by offering to groom some of RDA\u2019s horses.\nGrooming encompasses anything from mucking out stables, to being taught how to shower, curry-comb, brush and pick out hooves. Curry-combing ponies is the equivalent of what we feel during a 90 minute massage \u2013 damn shiok.\nYou might have missed their recent Open House Carnival , but RDA always welcome new volunteers. This is just one part of Equine-Assisted Therapy you can start with.\nAnd because they can\u2019t always get hours of attention, some of the RDA\u2019s 24 horses and ponies are going to be very grateful to you. It\u2019s totally a win-win.\nPrice: Admission is free\nRiding For the Disabled Association: 5 Jalan Mashhor Singapore 299174 | Opening Hours: 9am \u2013 5.30pm (Weekdays) |Tel: +65 6250 0176 | Email: volunteer@rdasingapore.org.sg | Website\n3. Farmart Centre\nFarmart Centre is an environment so far from city life that it feels like you\u2019re not even in Singapore. Get up close and personal with goats (I\u2019ll bet lots of you didn\u2019t know about goats in Singapore), rabbits and frogs amongst other animals.\nThere\u2019s a host of activities to do at Farmart Centre Singapore. But if all you really want is to feed a goat, without anyone trying to have a conversation with you, this is the place I\u2019d come to. Hop onto a free shuttle bus from Choa Chu Kang and you\u2019ve got your ride in.\nPrice: Admission is free\nFarmart Centre Singapore:\u00a067 Sungei Tengah Road, Singapore 699008 | Opening Hours: 10am \u2013 10pm (Sun \u2013 Thurs) |\u00a0Tel: +65 6767 0070 | Website\n4. S.E.A Aquarium\nWater does a pretty good job at giving you quiet relaxing feelings. When it\u2019s quiet, so does the S.E.A Aquarium.\nWarning: Pick a very early weekday morning to come visit, because when you\u2019re battling a crowd of tourists on a weekend and can\u2019t even move, the last thing you\u2019re going to feel is calm.\nIn the quiet of early mornings, sans noisy little kids smacking their hands on glass panes, one can properly take in the vastness that is the underwater world. No matter how many times you go, it always is quite an amazing realisation of how bright and colourful it can be down under.\nAside from the arch of underwater activity that happens overhead, there are also large empty spaces where you can sit, watching little fish go about their everyday fish lives.\nPrice: $30\nS.E.A Aquarium: 8 Sentosa Gateway, Sentosa Island, Singapore 098269 | Tel: +65 6577 8888\u00a0| Opening Hours: 10am \u2013 7pm | Website | Tickets\n\u2013Places For Some Quiet (But Not Totally Alone) Time\u2013\nThe sound of silence takes some getting used to \u2013 many of us are desperate for some quiet from Singapore\u2019s constant cacophony, before realising we\u2019re not used to the weird absence of bustling activity. So if you need a quiet spot with some amount of civilisation, this section is for you.\n5.\u00a0Riders Cafe @Bukit Timah Saddle Club\nNestled at the end of a winding road that opens into lush greenery, Riders Cafe offers the perfect aside from hectic work weeks. I admit, it\u2019s very far out of the way, and you will not want to go in on foot. But pick a day to use your Grab/Uber discounts and treat yourself.\nThe scones here are hands down the best I\u2019ve found in Singapore so far, and the al fresco seating options give you a cosy little nook for you to curl up in, away from the city\u2019s bustle, and watch the world go by.\nOf all the things that offer feelings of liberation, horses hanging out in paddocks or being free-schooled tops my list. You might not see the latter, but if you\u2019re here, you might just be able to catch a chilled out horse or two just munching on grass.\nRider\u2019s Cafe:\u00a051 Fairways Drive Singapore 286965 | Opening Hours: 8am \u2013 9pm (Sun \u2013 Thurs, Closed on Mondays) | Tel:\u00a0+65 6466 9819 | Website\n6. Library@Orchard\nWith gorgeous natural light, endless shelves of books and the smell of paper, this place is therapy for the soul. It makes me feel like Belle in Beauty And The Beast when he gifts her with an entire library. Heck, if anyone gave me a gift like that I\u2019d be in love with them too.\nQuietly occupying two levels, this is one of my top picks on the list, taking you away from the city while still being right in the middle of Orchard Road. Just go at an off-peak time so you don\u2019t run into people taking pictures of themselves after finding out about how \u201cInsta-worthy\u201d it is.\nLibrary@Orchard:\u00a0277 Orchard Road #03-12 / #04-11 OrchardGateway Singapore 238858 | Opening Hours:\u00a011am \u2013 9pm | Website\n\u2013Places With Beautiful Scenery\u2013\nAlthough known for being a \u201cGarden City\u201d, Singapore has limited places to go to if you want to leave the city behind and be one with nature. These places however, offer a sense of serenity for even the most flustered and overworked minds.\n7. Jurong Lake Gardens\nTucked inside the furthest end of Singapore, this place boasts two themed gardens \u2013 one Chinese-themed and one Japanese-themed. Although Jurong Lake Gardens in its entirety will only be complete in 2018, most of it is already open to the public.\nOne of the major perks of being all the way out in the middle of nowhere is that it is less likely to be crowded. Unless you count the\u00a0Herons, Egrets and Storks that make regular visits to this gorgeous lake.\nYou don\u2019t have to be an avid birdwatcher to appreciate this space as there aren\u2019t many other places that allow you a view, fresh air and a whole lot of peace and quiet.\nPrice: Admission Is Free\nJurong Lake Gardens: 1 Chinese Garden Rd, Singapore 619795 | Opening Hours:\u00a05:30am \u2013 11pm (Chinese Garden),\u00a05:30am \u2013 7pm (Japanese Garden) | Website\n8. Singapore\u2019s Last Kampong: Lorong Buangkok\nSituated just off Yio Chu Kang Road lies Singapore\u2019s very last Kampong, although I didn\u2019t know this when I first stumbled into it. This quickly has become my favourite running route because of its unpaved roads and how it reminds me of villages in the mountains of Chiang Mai, Thailand.\nTake a walk into 1950s Singapore and literally feel like you\u2019re going through a time warp \u2013 a world that existed before computers, iPhones and the endless rat race we\u2019re all trying to get to the end of.\nLorong Buangkok:\u00a0Lorong Buangkok Singapore 539748 (just off Gerald Drive)\n9. Lower Seletar Reservoir Park\nThe roads leading into Lower Seletar Reservoir Park are surrounded by trees and feel briefly like a drive through the countryside. Pop out the other end and if you\u2019re lucky enough, catch the sunset as it spills light onto the reservoir.\nLower Seletar Reservoir is one of the quietest of quiet spots in Singapore. Yes, there\u2019re other reservoirs and parks, but maybe because it\u2019s lesser known, it is most often disarmingly and comfortingly empty.\nThis place has spectacular views, making it perfect for a stroll or to sit and be pensive. In fact, don\u2019t say I told you this but, if you ever need a desperate escape from work, this is the place I\u2019d come to.\nLower Seletar Reservoir Park: Connected by Yishun Ave 1 and Lentor Avenue | Website\n10.\u00a0Kallang River\nI saved the best for last, and this is by far my favourite on the list.\nOkay, I admit, Kallang River is not say the prettiest river you\u2019ll ever see, but if you would like to embark on a solo activity that allows you a panoramic, scenic view, you\u2019ve got it. If you want to be really alone, rent a single kayak and paddle out as far as you can.\nThe vast expanse of water is always a good reminder that no matter how big or insurmountable our problems seem, they\u2019re only an itsy bitsy piece in the grand scheme of things.\u00a0You might still see the concrete jungle but it\u2019s far enough away, and you won\u2019t hear a thing.\nHere, it feels like the world can\u2019t touch you.\nImagine being on a tiny little boat in the middle of the ocean, not knowing where you\u2019re going but being completely okay with that.\u00a0Kallang River probably looks like a puddle compared to the ocean, but we take what we can get in the middle of a city hey?\nThen, just close your eyes and float.\nPrice: $12 for two hours\nSingapore Sports Hub Water Sports Centre:\u00a08\u00a0Stadium Walk Singapore 397699 | Opening Hours:\u00a07am \u2013 8pm (Mon to Sun) | Website\nGet the latest updates by following us on Twitter @hypeandstuff & Facebook Have an interesting story to share?

            "10 Delightful Fish & Chips You Batter Not Miss Out On!\nLast updated on May 1st, 2019,\nCaptain Snapper at habitat by honestbee\nhabitat by honestbee may just have the best fish and chips in Singapore! If you\u2019re craving for some great fish and chips, pop by habitat by honestbee and head straight to Captain Snapper! You won\u2019t be disappointed for sure. All 5 types of fish on offer (barramundi, dory, halibut, Atlantic cod and snapper) are encased in a crisp Tiger Beer batter, yum.\nWe especially loved the super fresh halibut which was sweet and exceptionally palatable. The barramundi was really tasty too! Have your fish and chips with any of the 4 house-made sauces, or even just on their own, and we promise that you\u2019ll be hooked on the very first bite!\nThe portions are very generous so come hungry or bring a friend along!\nHabitat by Honest Bee\nOpening Hours: 10am to 10pm (Sunday - Thursday) and 10am to 12am (Friday, Saturday and Eve of Public Holiday)\n5 Star Corner Western Food\nKopitiams are steeped with hidden food gems because there\u2019re simple too many kopitiams to check out. 5 Star Western Food is one of such gems. We tried their fish and chips, but it didn\u2019t impress. However, for $6, this really deserves 5 stars for value. We got 2 medium-sized fillets with crispy skin and a tasty fish. My only gripe\u00a0was that the skin was a little too thin, so it wasn\u2019t really quite as satisfying as one would expect. I liked the thick cut fries but would\u2019ve preferred it to be better seasoned. I thought that the unpretentious slice of garlic bread really stood out \u2013 well-seasoned and crunchy. I hear that their steak and chicken chop are more popular with diners.\n5 Star Corner Western Food\nAddress: 805 Hougang Central, Singapore 530805\nPhone: 6385 9388\nMr Fish & Chips @ Wok Inn caf\u00e9\nOnce located in Toa Payoh, Mr Fish & Chips has since relocated to PoMo. They\u2019re known for their crispy fish and chips so we had to try it out! We got the set meal which costs $9.90 and you get to pick 2 out of 3 sides \u2013 Chips, mashed potatoes or\u00a0coleslaw. I thought that it was a really value-for-money\u00a0meal. No wonder this place is packed during lunch and dinner time. Stall owner, Michael Molina, has over 9 years of experience in a fish and chips shop in the UK, and he has\u00a0brought his expertise over so that Singaporeans can also enjoy an authentic plate of fish and chips at affordable prices. Needless to say, the fish and chips here are pretty legit. The stall owner also imports bottles of malt vinegar which is what the British add to their fish and chips. The fish was silky smooth, and the portion was generous. The fries were similar to potato wedges. If you\u2019re a student, you can opt for the student meal \u2013 just remember to bring your student card!\nAddress: 1 Selegie Road, #01-20/21, Singapore 188306\nMobile: 9897 6048\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/cafewokinn/\nWestern Barbecue\nOne of the star tenants at\u00a0Old Airport Road Food Centre is Western Barbecue. Diners can look forward to popular dishes such as\u00a0fish and chips, mixed grill and chicken chop here. For a mere $6, the fish and chips were really impressive and I felt like they should have charged more, given the superior quality of the fish. Expect\u00a02 medium-sized fillets with a side of thick cut fries. The dory fish is coated in homemade batter before it is fried to crispy perfection. I liked that the batter was buttery and the fish, silky smooth. You even get a butter bun to fill up your tummy. This\u00a0makes the most value-for-money fish and chips in this list! If you haven\u2019t tried it, you really should!\nWestern Barbeque\nAddress: 51 Old Airport Road, #01-53, Old Airport Road Food Centre, Singapore 390051\nPhone: 6440 8934\nHumble and unpretentious, Chops! Grills and sides is yet another contender in the race for the Best Fish & Chips title. Despite the great quality, the prices are aptly priced for the common man, like myself. For $7.90, you get to pick 2 sides to accompany your battered fried fish. Diners can opt from Aglio Olio, Garlic fried rice, Shoestring Fries, Romane lettuce, Tuna Salad, Pasta salad or coleslaw. We got the fries and garlic fried rice. Waiting time wasn\u2019t long and I loved the friendly service. They coat\u00a0dory fish in bread crumbs so the batter wasn\u2019t as buttery as the others. I\u00a0found the batter a little too thick but\u00a0I realised\u00a0that if I dipped the fish in tar tar sauce, everything gets balanced out. Kudos! What stood out was the recommended garlic fried rice which was really fragrant and well-seasoned.\nChops Grills & Sides\nAddress: Blk 727 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6, Singapore 560727\nOpening Hours: 11am to 10pm daily.\nCups and Canvas\nCups and Canvas is a homey caf\u00e9 that offers coffee and a limited selection\u00a0of food items. I enjoyed the outdoor seating\u00a0which makes for some lovely photos. If you\u2019re a caf\u00e9 hopper, this is one caf\u00e9 you should definitely check out. For a price of $12.90, the fish and chips was a little pricier than those offered at other places. It comes with 3 small fillets, a bed of crispy fries, and a side of salad. The fish was a little too oily and soggy which didn\u2019t really appeal to us but it was still decent.\u00a0On the other hand, the fries were light and crispy. Although they weren\u2019t as thick as I would have liked them to be, I still found myself reaching for more.\nAddress: No. 1 Bukit Batok Central Link, West Mall, Singapore 658713\nPhone: 6884 6855\nI am\u2026 Cafe\nFish and chips doesn\u2019t have to be exclusive, so it\u2019s great that there are places offering halal versions so that everybody can enjoy their plate of delicious fish and chips, regardless of race, or religion. One of such places is I am\u2026 caf\u00e9, which dishes out some mean fish and chips.Beneath\u00a0a beautiful golden brown exterior, lies\u00a0lusciously succulent flesh. The batter was surprisingly hard, but nothing too tough I couldn\u2019t bite through. The fish did retain a slight fishy taste which may disappoint some, but it was still a very delicious piece of fried fish. Although it is significantly pricier than other options, this is probably one of the best fish and chips in town.\nI am\u2026 Cafe\nPhone: 6295 5509\nSmith\u2019s Fish and Chips\nSmith\u2019s is dedicated to its roots, serving the true-blue fish and chips. Run by Englishmen, Smith\u2019s boasts a robust and extensive menu of fish and chips. They offer a fine selection of white fish including the popular Dory, Cod, Haddock and Halibut. I was\u00a0recommended the Haddock, which is what the English enjoy most frequently in their country. The prices are really steep when compared to other options, but you are getting your money\u2019s worth. They put a lot of hard work into their fish and chips \u2013 they peel and chip the potatoes, and make the batter daily. Owing to a different cooking method, the chips here aren\u2019t as crispy as you\u2019d expect but I liked that the flavour of the potatoes were more prominent. The haddock\u00a0is super fresh and has a flakier texture. They serve the fish and chips unseasoned, but every table comes with a salt shaker and a bottle of malt vinegar. You might be disappointed because it ain\u2019t the crispy fish and chips you\u2019d expect. I guess the English enjoy their fish and chips really differently from us.\nSmith\u2019s Fish and Chips\nAddress: 271 Bukit Timah Road, #01-02 Balmoral Plaza, Singapore 259708\nPhone: 6737 9313\nOpening Hours: 1130am to 11pm daily. Last orders at 1030pm\nMolly Malone\u2019s\nA friend introduced this place to me so I decided to give it a try. I\u2019m not saying that this is the best, but off the top of my head, Molly Malone\u2019s serves one of the best fried fish around. For $16, we got two medium sized golden-brown fillets, a side of thick fries and 2 dips \u2013 chilli sauce and tar tar sauce. Dory is encased in an impressive batter which is\u00a0neither too hard, nor too soggy, so the knife cuts through with the right amount of ease. The fish was light, smooth and moist. \u00a0The fries, were a tad too salty, but had the right balance of crispiness while still retaining the original flavour of\u00a0potatoes. I can\u2019t quite explain it, but this appealed to me. A reservation I had though, was the long waiting time even though there was nobody. Nonetheless, the chill atmosphere and friendly staff did help to mitigate my frustration.\nPhone: 6536 2029\nMobile: 8620 9089\nOpening Hours: 11am to 1am from Mondays to Wednesdays. 11am to 2am on Thursdays. 11am to 3am on Fridays. 12pm to 2am on Saturdays. Closed on Sundays.\n\u5403western\nWestern stalls in kopitiams are always rather obsure, and \u5403western is no exception. Launched about a year back, \u5403western offers affordably-priced western food that everybody can enjoy. For just $6.50, this is one fish and chips that I\u2019ll be coming back for. Not because I\u2019m a cheapo okay, but I earnestly don\u2019t think that it can get any better than this, at this price. I couldn\u2019t wait to dive into\u00a0the 2 crispy dory fish fillets, side of thick and chunky fries, and interesting purple cabbage salad. The combination of tender fish and\u00a0buttery thick batter was spot on. I have no complaints at all. \u00a0I liked that they use crinkle cut\u00a0fries because it reminds me of the fish and chips that I had when\u00a0I was a child (so nostalgic). Truffle-flavoured\u00a0fries are available too. We polished\u00a0the plate even though we were already full. Overall, this was my favorite. Even though the staff wasn\u2019t quite friendly, I\u2019ll definitely return should my craving for fish and chips resurface.\n\u5403western\nAddress: 206 Toa Payoh North, #01-1197, Singapore 310206\nOpening Hours: 1130am to 830pm on weekdays. 12pm to 830pm on weekends.\nWe all enjoy a hearty plate of fish and chips every once in a while. Some of us love soggy fries, some prefer crispy thick ones instead. Nonetheless, hopefully this short guide will be\u00a0useful!\u00a0Just remember to drink lots of water after, so you don\u2019t fall ill.\nMissTamChiak.com made anonymous visits and paid its own meals at the stalls featured here.\nLet\u2019s build a food community that helps to update the food news in Singapore!

            "Ah, the humble fish and chips.\nIts undisguised simplicity makes it one of the more overlooked dishes, because no matter what you call it, or how you plate it, fish and chips is what it is \u2013 fried fish and fries. Perhaps because its ingredients are readily available, you\u2019ll be able to bite into those crispy fried fillets almost anywhere, from hipster cafes to that one \u201cWestern\u201d stall at hawker centres.\nHowever, the well-travelled are privy to the fact that despite its ubiquitous presence here, it originated as a bar staple in the United Kingdom, and was once a stock meal of the working classes there. As\u00a0a tribute to this modest English meal, we present to you a list of eateries that are checking all the right fish and chip boxes, and making it their own.\n1. Oxwell & Co\nOxwell & Co is an English-inspired bar and bistro located smack in the middle of the hipster enclave that is Ann Siang Hill, and any English-inspired place HAS to have fish and chips.\nWe were pleasantly surprised by Oxwell & Co\u2019s rendition of this famed English dish. The battered sea bass was so well seasoned that we didn\u2019t even need condiments to enjoy this dish.\nRead our full review of Oxwell & Co here .\nAddress: 5 Ann Siang Road, Singapore 069688\nTelephone: 6438 3984 | Open Tue to Sat 10am-late.\n2.

            "About Oxwell & Co\nOxwell & Co is situated in hipster central, Ann Siang Hill. It\u2019s been around for a while but it was always one of those places I passed by on the way to somewhere else. I\u2019d occasionally hear whispers about this English-inspired bar and bistro, so I was pretty pumped when I finally got the chance to try it myself.\nThe Bar (1st Floor)\nDrinks\nThe establishment comprises of multiple floors, each with its own theme. The first level serves as a British bar, complete with beer and cocktails on tap. I had myself a Gin & Tonic ($12) which was extremely refreshing, especially after the hike from the bus stop.\nMy partner had a Pina Colada ($20) topped with a meringue, which is as much of a joy to see as it is to drink.\nBar Food\nPork Scratchings ($6)\nMade with pig skin, these crispy and curly treats are sprinkled with a mixture of herbs and spices for a spicy kick. They are incredibly light and packed with flavour and the crunch as you bite into one just never gets old.\nOyster Scampi ($10 for a pair)\nThese oysters are battered and fried and topped with sambal mayonnaise. I loved the local touch, and it gave the dish some interesting flavours by combing the briny oysters with a touch of creamy spice. The oysters were nice and juicy too which made me a happy diner.\nCrispy Corn ($5)\nI can\u2019t stress how much I love these. It\u2019s crispy, but the spice mixture takes it into overdrive and it\u2019s great with the natural sweetness of the corn. They warned us that it was addictive, and they weren\u2019t kidding.\nRestaurant (2nd Floor)\nThe second floor houses the main dining area. It\u2019s got a nice casual vibe with tons of natural light while the Baroque inspired walls on the right fit snugly on top of the luxurious blue sofa seats. The open concept kitchen also gives diners a sneak peek at what goes on in the kitchen as they watch the chefs prepare the meals.\nFood\nSteak Tartare ($24)\nThere\u2019s a special place in my heart reserved for this dish, it\u2019s raw beef mixed with an array of herbs and aromatics like shallots and chives and bound together with egg yolk. It was delicious, and the meat was fresh although I thought it lacked a little seasoning, and there was a good balance of herbs which perfumed each bite with a refreshing crisp. My only complaint is that I wish that i had a bigger portion to go with that amount of perfectly crispy toasted bread.\nCured Ocean Trout ($26)\nThe trout was really tasty, it was cured in-house, and had a nice and firm texture that was really pleasing. The endives are an interesting touch, it\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste because of it\u2019s bitterness. You\u2019ll have to eat it with other things on the plate to balance it. Even then, I felt that it was a touch too overpowering.\nPackham Pear And Stilton ($22)\nStilton is an English cheese that inspires great love or sends you running to the hills. It\u2019s a blue cheese and it\u2019s very pungent. Having it with the pear brings an interesting play on flavours, but even with the endive it was just too pungent.\nCape Grim Porterhouse Steak ($140)\nWhen I saw this on the menu, I was brimming with excitement. Its appearance on the table was a sight to behold, a huge steak beautifully charred on the outside and red on the inside. You can easily feed 2 or 3 people with one steak.\nThe dish comes with an array of condiments you can pair your steak with including: pommery mustard, english mustard, horseradish, vinegar, salt and pepper. I loved the fact that the restaurant made it so easy to play around with the flavours, and the steak was great with the horseradish especially. It was cooked unevenly though, and some parts were rarer than others.\nFish & Chips ($26)\nThis one surprised me, and I\u2019m so grateful for it. It\u2019s hard to find good fish and chips in Singapore, and I\u2019m glad to say I can add this to the list. They use sea bass, which lends a firm texture but is still flakey enough, the batter is also well seasoned and really tasty. I wolfed this one down without a second thought. You won\u2019t need ketchup, chili sauce or vinegar to enjoy the fish.\nThe Private Room\nThe private dining room is inspired by a study, with quirky artifacts lining the walls. It\u2019s nice and cosy, and the squirrels will surely draw the attention of curious guests. The room is specially used for private events that seat up to 12 diners or 30 for a cocktail reception. So if you ever need some place quirky this would probably fit the bill.\nAn English Pub Experience\nOxwell & Co has proved to be a fine choice when it comes to dining in Ann Siang, despite a few hiccups, the stand out items like the Crispy Corn and Fish & Chips definitely overshadowed the complaints that I had. Some menu items might not be for everybody though, so consider your options wisely.\nGetting There\nAnn Siang is smack in the middle of Telok Ayer and Chinatown MRT, and they are both within walking distance so you can take your pick. The buses don\u2019t go directly into Ann Siang but there are plenty of them that stop around the area. It\u2019s a hill, so be prepared to hike depending on what direction you come in from.\nWhere: 5 Ann Siang Road\nWhen: Tuesday \u2013 Saturday 10:00 AM til late\nScore: 8/10\nTrending\n6 hours ago\n21 hours ago\n1 day ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\n4 days ago\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2020 TheSmartLocal.com\n0\nSHARES\n"

            "\ud83c\udf81Get a Premium Gift Card for just $59 (U.P. $99) >\nWent to 49 Seats for dinner few nights ago for a friend's birthday party\ud83d\ude0b\nFirstly, I just wanna say that the size of their restaurant did not look like 49 seats hahaha (or is this just a unique name for the restaurant :/ who knows right?)\nI really like the simple marble + silver interior, along with the decor\ud83d\ude07\nFood wise, I know everyone is raving over this Seafood Tomyum Pasta - $14.90 (i added + 49 level spiciness hence the massive amount of chilli padi) but I honestly felt that the Fish and Chips with Tomyum sauce is more worth it(huge portion + comes with 2 sides) - $16.90. All pasta portions are lesser in my opinion\ud83d\ude05\nFood here has no further GST and Service Charge if I am not wrong? Staff was also super accomodating to helping us plan for the surprise.\nI would definitely visit again as food was affordable and delicious\ud83e\udd2a Ratings 8.5/10!!\nTom Yum Seafood Pasta has always been one my most favourite ordering dish. Love it's fresh seafood compliments the robust thick cream sauce packed with good punch of sweetness, tangy and spiciness in every mouthful that tastes like a cheesier version of Tom Yum.\nA good alternative if you are not keen in spicy Tom Yum will be Seafood Marinara. Pasta is pretty tasty with mussels and prawns paired with tomato sauce.\nCreamy Smoked Duck Pasta is another favourite.\nThe slices of smoked duck was very tender, not tough at all and well marinated and flavourful, and the cream sauce totally not jelat. Definitely satisfy any cream pasta lover.\nTheir crunchy fries which they are very generously drenched with cheese and mayo that there's always enough sauces till the end. Fries are not overly oily and it\u2019s addictive! Perfect for sharing.\nThe food is all served on tin plates it gives off an old school vibe. One good thing about 49 Seats is that it does not charge GST or service charge.\u00a0Hooray!\n2 Likes\nFind more places to eat with our guides and articles\n"

            "13\nSHARES\nDiscussion has arisen surrounding the unprecedented peace summit that is due to happen in Singapore; will North Korean Supreme leader Kim Jong-un seek solace in this sweltering Singaporean heat? Is the Singaporean palate too eclectic for his liking? Most importantly, will our Rendang be too crispy for his taste? Okay fine, overdue buzzword is overdue. But I digress, with the abundance of harvest North Korea experiences all year round, you can only imagine how broad of a spectrum North Korea cuisines stretch for.\nWith the Supreme leader\u2019s welfare in mind, before he gets utterly unimpressed at the totally authentic chains of Korean BBQ outlets, here\u2019s a list of top naengmyeon or Korean Cold Noodles that\u2019ll no doubt make even Kim Jong-un feel at home.\nAfterall, it is only his 4th trip out of North Korea since he assumed office, so let\u2019s all be a little accommodating.\nTable of Contents\nWhere: 71 Loewen Road, #01-01, 248847\nSupreme leader Kim might just denounce North Korea and name Singapore as his domicile after tasting this bowl of cold yet al dente strands of buckwheat noodles bathed in a bowl of cold broth. The perfect resolution to the heat of a midsummer night. In all seriousness, if you\u2019re looking for somewhere premium, a place nestled in the upscale side of town, Chang Korean Charcoal BBQ is the place to head to. As the name suggests, if you\u2019re not a fan of cold noodles, opt for their\u00a0premium cuts of meat to go with this cold dish!\nThere might not be a need for him to make a table reservation but for us, commoners, secure your seats with Quandoo today!\nHansik Korean Restaurant\nWhere: Level 2, Heartland Mall, 205 Hougang Street 21, 530205\nCooked noodles in an ice cold broth is still very much an outlandish culinary field to us Singaporeans. Coined as the national dish of North Korea, some might be thrown off by the idea of a chilly broth but you\u2019ll be baffled by how well the tartness of the soup couples with the chilled nature of this dish! Hansik Korean Restaurant is another renowned establishment that does this dish justice at a mere affordable price point. Traditional Korean side dishes are also commonly ordered in this restaurant, particularly the stew dishes!\nGaia Korean Restaurant\nWhere: 17E Lorong Liput, 277731\nThe Korean cold noodles often come in one huge bundle, with intended purposes; the noodles are often left uncut as a symbolism for the longevity of life and good health. Explains why the man himself presented to President Moon a bowl of this noodle as goodwill upon the union of the nation\u2019s halves. Gaia Korean Restaurant is amongst the very few Korean restaurants in Singapore that serve bibim-naengmyeon, the spicy rendition of the formally mentioned. Opened by Chef Chun, Gaia Korean Restaurant has been critically acclaimed by numerous local publications. Hailed by many pub-goers, this is the perfect pig-out spot in the midst of a boozy Holland Village.\nHoHo Korean Restaurant\nWhere: 106 Clementi Street 12, #01-58/60, 120106\nSPOILER: HoHo Korean Restaurant is also on Foodpanda if Sunset Way is a bus trip too far for you!\nIt may seem like we\u2019re giving the Supreme leader (and the readers) an option too many for a simple concoction of noodles and broth, topped with the token slices of meat and vegetables. But bear with us, we\u2019re almost at the end. HoHo Korean Restaurant is one that stands out in this list; opened by a Korean family, you can expect authenticity at the very least. HoHo Korean Restaurant\u2019s impeccable service is not to be dismissed, with high praises coming from customers, a perfect hideaway from the bustle to end a long weekend if you ask me!\nCho-Won Garden Korean Restaurant\nImage Credit: Alpha | Flickr\nWhere: 2, Peck Seah Street, 079305\nAnother portrait of the stainless-steel bowl, the recurring presence of buckwheat noodles and lightly colored broth. We promise you this is the last, Supreme leader Kim Jong-un. If your stay extends beyond the 5 Korean cold noodle places we\u2019ve recommended for each day of your stay here, please exercise revisiting.\nCho-Won Garden Korean Restaurant is said to be the most popular amongst the Koreans living in Singapore. You know what they say \u2013 eat where the locals (Koreans) dine to live like a local. Given the authenticity of the food, this is the closest you\u2019ll ever get to experience Korea in Singapore.\nDon\u2019t leave on an empty stomach\nAs Trump seeks to placate Supreme leader Kim Jong-un in the now-uncertain peace summit, perhaps this dearly drawn up listicle of the best Korean Cold Noodles in Singapore could prove to be enticing enough for him to bestow our land with his presence.\nVisitor or no visitor, enjoy the same gastronomic adventure at the comfort of your home with Foodpanda!

            "April 06, 2016\nBEST ANGEL HAIR PASTA In Singapore! Served Chilled Or Warm, Here Are 22 Places To Try!\nAfter 25 Beef Bowls and 33 Different Foie Gras Dishes , my friends thought I'm a bit crazy to embark on a quest for 22 BEST ANGEL HAIR PASTA in Singapore.\n\"Aren't you currently on #pinkypiggu100daysof salad diet?\" Haha, well yes, but those flowing strands of slender angel hair are just too irresistible.\nBeing thinner and lighter in texture, angel hair couples better with delicate sauces. More often than not, it is served chilled and infused with flavors of kombu, chives and truffle oil at most establishments. Given the current spell of rising temperatures, a plate of chilled angel hair would be a most suitable \"summer dish\" to have. Shall we fancify it with caviar, uni (sea urchin), or oysters? Yes! Yes! Yes!\nThis guide also includes warm versions of the dish, as well as capellini which is said to be just a wee thicker than angel hair. PinkyPiggu's personal Best 5 Angel Hair Pasta is revealed at end of post.\nLet's start our angel hair journey here!\nThe below are listed in alphabetical order by restaurant name.\n999.99 (Five Nines) ~ Chilled Caviar Capellini, $20++\n1. 999.99 (Five Nines)\nChilled Caviar Capellini, $20++\nAll that glisten is not just gold but also the black pearls of caviar that adorned the Chilled Caviar Capellini. The cured fish roe did provide a bit of salty profile to the dish, but otherwise the pasta itself was in dire need of a stronger hand in flavoring. Good for those who have a light palate.\nFacebook | 29 Keong Saik Road, S(089136) | +65 6221 7098 | Mon-Fri 12pm-2.30pm & 6pm-12am / Sat & Sun 6pm-12am\nArteastiq ~ Salted Egg Capellini, $23++\n2. Arteastiq\nSalted Egg Yolk Capellini, $23++\nThe current \"salted-egg-yolk-anything\" craze is now making its mark on pasta dishes too. Recently launched as part of Arteastia's revamped menu, the Salted Egg Yolk Capellini features strands of thin pasta tossed with slightly spicy egg yolk cream, and served with prawns by the side. We thought the salted egg yolk flavor could be stronger.\nWebsite | Facebook | Mandarin Gallery - 333 Orchard Road, #04-14/15, S(238867) | +65 62358730 | Weekday 11am-10.30pm & Weekends 10am-10.30pm | Plaza Singapura - 68 Orchard Road, #03-70/72, S(238839) | +65 63360951 | Daily 10am-10pm\nChotto Matte ~ Aglio Olio Angel Hair, $38++\n3. Chotto Matte\nAglio Olio Angel Hair, $38++\nServed with crispy sakura ebi, sea urchin, and spiked with chili padi, the mildly-spicy dish would be pleasing especially if you're a fan of aglio olio style pasta. I can close one eye to the slightly under-cooked angel hair (a tad firm is better than being mushy), but was irked that its presentation totally differed from the alluring picture on their website. Portion can also be more generous when this is supposed to be a main dish.\nWebsite | Facebook | 54 Blair Road #01-01, S(089954) | +65 6222 8846 | Mon-Sun 11.30am-12am (last order for lunch at 2pm)\nDa Luca Italian Restaurant ~ Chilled Angel Hair Pasta with Hokkaido Scallops, $35++\n4. Da Luca Italian Restaurant\nChilled Angel Hair Pasta with Hokkaido Scallops, $35++\nOh my goodness, this is a G.E.M. found! The al-dente bite of the cold pasta, the well-balanced flavors enhanced with scent of truffle oil, the fastidious care of serving it on a chilled plate, every detail was faultless! There was a sense of familiarity as I was relishing in every delicious moment. Turns out that Chef Luca used to work in Gunther's before setting up his eponymous restaurant. Ahh.... no wonder!\nWebsite | Facebook | No.1 Goldhill Plaza #01-19/21, S(308899) | +65 62584846 | Mon-Sun Lunch 12pm-3pm & Dinner 6.30pm-11pm\nDazzling Caf\u00e9 Pink ~ Lobster Cold Capellini, $26.90++\n5. Dazzling Caf\u00e9 Pink\nLobster Cold Capellini, $26.90++\nSo chio! Who can resist such a beautifully-plated dish? Still, I went to Dazzling Caf\u00e9's latest outlet at Orchardgateway with \nexpectations managed as my previous experience at the Capitol Piazza \nstore was memorable in a less than positive way. Surprisingly, the chilled capellini turned out to be better than expected. Though the pasta was a little too soft and bland for my liking, it was made palatable when mixed with the creamy pink mentaiko sauce and minty green basil powder. Certainly no complaints about that succulent chunk of lobster. Very refreshing dish as a whole. Exclusive to Orchardgateway branch only.\nWebsite | Facebook | Orchardgateway, #01-12/13/14, 277 Orchard Road, S(238858) | +65 63853639 | Sun-Thu 12pm-10pm, Fri & Sat 12pm-10.30pm\nEmber ~ Ebi Pasta, $28++\nEbi Pasta, $28++\nHeard much about the Ebi Pasta from Ember, and it truly deserved all the good comments. Well-cooked capellini pasta, crisp Sakura ebi, wonderous pairing of kombu and crustacean oil, lovely umaminess in every mouthful. What a well-rounded rendition of the warm pasta dish. I polished the whole plate clean and hankered for more.\nWebsite | Facebook | 50 Keong Saik Road, S(089154) | +65 63471928 |  Mon-Fri 11.30am-2pm & 6.30pm-10pm, Sat 6.30pm-10pm, closed on Sun\nGaribaldi Italian Restaurant ~ Cold Angel Hair with Hokkaido Scallop & Carelian Caviar, $48++\n7. Garibaldi Italian Restaurant\nCold Angel Hair with Hokkaido Scallop & Carelian Caviar, $48++\nGaribaldi prides itself on using Carelian caviar, harvested from Siberian sturgeon and is said to be \"silky in the mouth, with a perfectly integrated saltiness and a long finishing tone of lake and sea\" (as described on their menu). Well, nothing to nitpick about the caviar, nor the freshness of the scallops used, and pasta was cooked just nice. But even with truffle oil and a dash of tabasco to lift up the flavors, the entire combination still came across as too subtle to make any impression.\nWebsite | Facebook | 36 Purvis Street, #01-02, S(188613) | +65 6837 1468 | Daily Lunch 12pm-2.30pm & Dinner 6.30pm-10.30pm\nGattopardo ~ Cold Angel Hair, $58++\n8. Gattopardo\nCold Angel Hair, $58++\nAnother good looker! This is also one of the more decadent ones luxuriating with toppings of sea urchin, caviar and oyster. Pricey but every bite was worth the splurge!\nWebsite | Facebook | 34 Tras Street, S(079026) | +65 63385498 | Mon-Fri 12pm-2.30pm & 6.30pm-10.30pm, Sat 6.30pm-10.30pm, Closed on Sun\nGunther's Modern French Cuisine ~ Cold Angel Hair Pasta, $60++\n9. Gunther's Modern French Cuisine\nCold Angel Hair Pasta, $60++\nIts look was deceptively unassuming (my colleague said it appeared too \"pale\" haha) and the taste, absolutely \nD.I.V.I.N.E.! Every strand of the angel hair pasta is nicely chilled and\n tossed in chives and kombu dressing, with generous infusion of truffle \noil and luxurious touches of Oscietra caviar propelling every bite into \nintense orgasmic heights. So delightful, so gratifying, so exquisite in \nflavors, I was literally bubbling with excitement. This signature cold \nangel hair pasta is a definite must-try when you're at Gunther's.\nWebsite | Facebook | 36 Purvis Street, #01-03, S(188613) | Tel +65 63388955, SMS +65 \n90103075 | Mon-Sat 12pm-2.30pm, 6.30pm-10.30pm, Closed on Sun\nGunther's Modern French Cuisine, Warm Angel Hair Pasta, $38++\n10. Gunther's Modern French Cuisine\nWarm Angel Hair Pasta, $38++\nThe cold pasta might be Gunther's signature, but the warm angel hair pasta coated with luscious seafood nantua sauce and toppings of Sakura prawns well deserves some attention too. This time round, it tasted even better than how I remember it to be. Strongly recommended if you prefer something rich and savory to warm your tummy.\nWebsite | Facebook | 36 Purvis Street, #01-03, S(188613) | Tel +65 63388955, SMS +65 \n90103075 | Mon-Sat 12pm-2.30pm, 6.30pm-10.30pm, Closed on Sun\nHakumai Sushi & Omakase ~ Truffle Angel Hair, $20++\n11. Hakumai Sushi & Omakase\nTruffle Angel Hair, $20++\nThis plate of deceptively simple chilled truffle angel hair took me by surprise! Besides the crispy ebi, each mouthful was accompanied by enjoyable pops of tobiko. The lingering whiff of truffle was unmistakable too. You know how much it says when I delayed finishing off the last few bites just to prolong the gratification lol! Definitely returning for this again!\nWebsite | Facebook |  International Plaza, 10 Anson Road, #01-50A, S(079903) | Tel +65 62244790 | Mon-Sat 11.30am-3pm & 6pm-10.30pm\nHorizon Bistronomy ~ Chilled Truffle Angel Hair, $8+ (no GST)\n12. Horizon Bistronomy\nChilled Truffle Angel Hair, $8+ (no GST)\nThe rendition at Horizon Bistronomy has a distinctly sharp taste due to the white balsamic vinegar added. Invigorating as a starter to the meal, but I can't help but feel that in terms of flavor, there is too much going on and perhaps better harmony is needed. Otherwise, the appetizer is undoubtedly a steal for its price with generous topping of ikura, golden tobiko, and lump crab meat.\nFacebook | Fragrance Empire Building - #01-03, 456 Alexandra Road, S(119962) | +65 62743655 | Mon-Fri 11am-11pm | Facebook | The Punggol Settlement - #02-04, 3 Punggol Point Road, S(828694) | +65 67022855 | Wed-Mon 6pm-10pm, closed on Tue\nIkyu ~ Chilled Angel Hair, $28.50++\n13. Ikyu\nChilled Angel Hair, $28.50++\nThe quaint neighborhood of Tiong Bahru might be more known for its numerous cafes and local delicacies, but this restaurant is quite a standout for its contemporary take on Japanese cuisine. Their rendition of Chilled Angel Hair is thoroughly delightful! I took the advice of the waiter and mixed well the pasta, ebi, salmon roe, chives and edible petals before partaking the colorful medley. Certainly ranks up there as one of the better ones.\nWebsite | Facebook | 5 Yong Siak Street, S(168643) | +65 62239003 | Tue-Sun 11.30am-2.30pm & 6pm-10.30pm, closed on Mon\nLes Amis ~ Cold Angel Hair Pasta, $50++\n14. Les Amis\nCold Angel Hair Pasta, $50++\nIf there is an award for most elegant-looking angel hair dish, the one at Les Amis will effortlessly clinch it. Immaculately twirled, crowned with caviar and edible gold flakes, the angel hair teases the eyes and awakes all senses the moment its umami bomb of truffle oil, kombu and seaweed exploded in the mouth. It was altogether lovely. I wouldn't have asked for anything more, except another plate... and another plate.\nWebsite | Facebook | 1 Scotts Road, #01-16 Shaw Centre, S(228208) | +65 67332225 |  Mon-Sun Lunch 12.00pm (Last seating at 2.00pm) & Dinner 7.00pm (Last seating at 9.30pm)\nNapoleon Food & Winer Bar ~ Shrimps Truffle Angel Hair, $21++\n15. Napoleon Food & Wine Bar\nShrimps Truffle Angel Hair, $21++\nWhen the bowl of Truffle Angel Hair arrived at my table, I thought \"wow, what a big bowl with such generosity of ingredients!\" Just look at the amount of shrimps! It also included a 75 \u00b0C egg which imparted a pleasing creaminess to the pasta. A very good option if you're looking for a warm and hearty angel hair pasta meal in the Tanjong Pagar area.\nWebsite | Facebook | 206 Telok Ayer Street, S(068641) | +65 6221 9282 | Mon-Fri 11.45am-12am, Sat 6pm-12am, closed on Sun\nPortico Prime ~ Chilled Truffle-scented Angel Hair Pasta, $28++\n16. Portico Prime\nChilled Truffle-scented Angel Hair Pasta, $28++\nPortico Prime's version of the chilled pasta dish looked superbly promising with lavish portions of Avruga caviar and Kawa ebi shrimps over perfectly twirled angel hair seasoned with dehydrated konbu shio. It was a tad salty for my palate though, and can be better chilled.\nWebsite | Facebook | 10 Dempsey Road, #01-20, S(247700) | +65 6474 7427 & +65 9114 1926 | Mon-Sun Lunch 11.30am-3pm / Dinner (Weekday) 6pm-10.30pm & (Weekend) 6pm-11.30pm / Open for drinks at 5pm\nRoots Kitchen Bar ~ Ocean Crab Pasta, $18nett\n17. Roots Kitchen Bar\nOcean Crab Pasta, $18nett\nMy friend suggested that I check out the Ocean Crab Pasta at Roots when I mentioned that I'm putting together a list of angel hair pasta dishes. Indeed, the angel hair was infused with a lip-smacking lobster bisque that was greatly intense in flavor, and had a comforting feel with generous slivers of crabmeat accompanying each mouthful. Worth a try, even though it got a tad surfeit towards the end.\nWebsite | Facebook | 30 Dickson Road, S(209512) | +65 6291 5679 | Wed-Mon 11am-11pm, closed on Tue\nRubato Italian Kitchen & Bar ~ Chilled Angel Hair Pasta, $50++\n18. Rubato Italian Kitchen & Bar\nChilled Angel Hair Pasta, $50++\nRubato's angel hair's pallid appearance corresponded to its lack in taste and flavors. The staff was concerned that I left more than half of the pasta untouched and later explained to me that the usual chef wasn't around to prepare the dish and thus it was not of its usual standard. Other online reviews are not too bad though. Looks like I must make a return visit to try it again.\nFacebook | 12 Greenwood Avenue, S(289204) | +65 62523200 | Mon-Sun 11.30am-10.30pm\nSaveur ~ Tiger Prawn with Caviar & Crispy Ebi, $9.90++\n19. Saveur\nTiger Prawn Pasta with Caviar & Crispy Ebi, $9.90++\nMost of us would already be familiar with Saveur's Pasta with chili oil, chopped kombu, pork sauce and sakura ebi, so I decided to try the recently-introduced Tiger Prawn Pasta for a change. Its coat of savory sauce was appetizing and the entire dish was finished in no time. Though the caviar was not of premium quality, I'm certainly not complaining considering the price point. Those pieces of prawns and crispy ebi were sufficient in rounding up the pasta dish to a satisfying note.\nWebsite | Facebook | Purvis Street - 5 Purvis Street #01-01 S(188584) | +65 63333121 | Lunch 12am-2.30pm & Dinner 6pm-9.30pm | Far East Plaza - 14 Scotts Rd #01-07B, S(228213) | +65 67361121 | Daily 11.30am-9.30pm | The Cathay - 2 Handy Road #01-11/12, S(229233) | +65 67351141 | Daily 12pm-9.30pm\nSaveur Art ~ Saveur's Pasta, $8++\n20. Saveur Art\nSaveur's Pasta, $8++\nSaveur's more upmarket sister joint, Saveur Art, has their own version of Saveur's Pasta too. The angel hair pasta is served with chorizo, grilled prawn and dressed in chopped kombu and chilli oil. Tastewise, it was okay. Not bad but not something which I'd come back especially for either.\nWebsite | Facebook | Ion Orchard #04-11, S(238801) | +65 66341141 | Daily 12pm-9.30pm\nViolet Herbs ~ Cold Pasta, $36++\n21. Violet Herbs\nCold Pasta, $36++\nThe angel hair was immaculately prepared! Every strand was evenly-cooked to an al-dente texture and chilled nicely, irresistibly tasty in its seasoning of shio seaweed, chive and perfumed with the lingering scent of truffle oil. But the rubbery abalone slices did nothing to enhance the dish. I would opt for different topping if given a choice.\nWebsite | Facebook | 81 Tras Street, S(079020) | +65 6221 3988 | Mon-Sat 11.30am-3pm & 6pm-10pm, closed on Sun\nViolet Herbs ~ Warm Pasta, $36++\n22. Violet Herbs\nWarm Pasta, $36++\nSuper shiok! To use this local slang to express the feeling of extreme satisfaction would be the most apt for this plate of angel hair dressed in lobster essence and fiery tones of bird eye chili (aka chili padi) with rayu oil. It's the kind of torturous pleasure that reduced the flesh to lust for bites after bites. The simple topping of Sakura ebi made a most ideal pairing.\nWebsite | Facebook | 81 Tras Street, S(079020) | +65 6221 3988 | Mon-Sat 11.30am-3pm & 6pm-10pm, closed on Sun\nPinkyPiggu's Best 5 Angel Hair Pasta\n1.

This means meal times\u00a0can get pretty distressing when deciding on what to eat since we are literally spoilt for choice. I\u2019m not complaining though. Amongst these choices, a popular pick is fish slice soup.\nWhat\u2019s sliced fish soup or \u00a0\u9c7c\u7247\u6c64 ? It\u2019s as literal as it sounds; fresh sliced fish (usually Batang or Grouper) in a fish soup broth with vegetables which most likely originated from the Teo Chews. This is usually accompanied with rice or noodles that might come on the side or added into the soup itself. Variations include frying the fish beforehand, then adding it into the soup, while evaporated milk is sometimes added as well to give the soup a richer body.\nWhile I love a decadent plate of Char Kway Teow, there are days where my body cries out for me to stop and to go for something much lighter instead. These are the days where a bowl of light and nourishing sliced fish soup comes into the picture which most Singaporeans perceive as being \u2018healthy\u2019.\nSo here\u2019s a list of places where you can get your yummy sliced fish soup in Singapore be it rain or shine. But do be prepared to queue up to half an hour for some of these stalls, because good things are worth waiting for.\n1. Jin Hua\u00a0Fish Head Bee Hoon \u91d1\u83ef\nSliced Fish Soup ($4 each). Well-known and given recommendations by various organisations, Jin Hua.\u00a0nestled in Maxwell Food Centre, serves up a very generous portion of sliced fish soup and definitely embodied what it means to be value for money.\u00a0I ordered a clear broth and another milky one to decide for myself which I like better.\nMy conclusion is the former.\u00a0The clear broth version is sweeter when it comes to tasting the soup\u00a0and the essence of the fish remains in it. The milkier one is more\u00a0indulgent and creamier but less sweet than the former. Depending on what flavour you are going for, both broths makes for a yummy meal. Though the slices of fish were slightly bland, it certainly complements the broth.\nJin Hua Fish Head Bee Hoon: 1 Kadayanallur Street, Maxwell Food Centre #01-77, Singapore 069184\n2. Guang Xing Original Taste Fish Head Bee Hoon\u00a0\u5e7f\u5174\u539f\u5473\u9c7c\u5934\u7c73\u7c89\nSliced Fish Soup ($4). Guang Xing Original Taste Fish Head Bee Hoon\u2019s sliced fish soup can be found at Changi Village Food Centre. This hawker stall is famed for it\u2019s fiery sambal fish head, which usually forms a queue.\nThey also serve a comforting bowl of sliced fish soup that is rich in flavour but light in broth. The fish slices are really fresh as well and this serves as a great alternative option for the non-spicy eaters.\nGuang Xing Original Taste Fish Head Bee Hoon: Blk 2 Changi Village Road,\u00a0Changi Village Food Centre\u00a0Stall #01-31,\u00a0Singapore 500002\n3. Piao Ji Fish Porridge\u00a0\u6a19\u8bb0\u9c7c\u7ca5\nSliced Fish Soup ($7). In Amoy Food Centre there\u2019s two fish soup stalls that are very much coveted and this is one of them. Piao Ji uses the more premium pomfret as their primary fish ingredient, hence the steeper in its\u2019 pricing. The fish slices are silky and soft in texture while the luscious and rich broth contains pork lard, which adds an extra layer of flavour.\nDefinitely heartier than most sliced fish soup, I\u2019d recommend this to people who are looking more for an indulgent bowl of sliced fish soup.\nPiao Ji Fish Porridge: 7 Maxwell Road, Amoy Street Food Centre, #02-100/103, Singapore 069111\n4. Angel Horse Teo Chew Fish Soup \u4ed9\u9a6c\u6f6e\u5dde\u9c7c\u6c64\nPhoto: foodiefc.wordpress.com\nPhoto: foodiefc.wordpress.com\nSliced Fish Soup ($5). This bowl of sliced fish soup can be found at Albert Centre Market and Food Centre. It comes in $3, $4 and $5, depending on how hungry you are. There\u2019s the usual bitter gourd and tofu in the mix. I like the addition of seaweed here, gives it more texture.\nAs opposed to the usual soya sauce, they serve the Teo Chew salted bean sauce with chilli padi instead, which complements the sliced fish very well, giving a contrast in flavours. Sliced fish and broth is flavourful\u00a0while the salted bean sauce lends a little sour and spicy flavour.\nAngel Horse Teo Chew Fish Soup: 270 Queen Street, Albert Centre Market and Food Centre Stall #01-95, Singapore 180270\n5.\u00a0Blanco Court Fish Meat Noodles\nPhoto: justeatla.blogspot.sg\nPhoto: justeatla.blogspot.sg\nSliced Fish Soup ($4). Blanco Court\u2019s sliced fish soup was very famous back in the days and this stall claims itself to be the original\u2019s since the demolition of Blanco Court Food Centre.\nWhile I\u2019m not entirely sure if it really is the original one, their sliced fish soup is still tasty nevertheless. The broth is aromatic, slightly richer in flavour and the fish is thick and juicy. Bonus of deep fried egg\u00a0is also served on the side,\u00a0don\u2019t we all love that?\nBlanco Court Fried Fish Soup: 341 Beach Road, Luk Lu Eating House, Singapore 199567\n6. A.S Seafood Soup \u5b89\u76db\nGrouper Seafood Soup ($10). Moving to a new location from Bedok, A.S Seafood Soup can now also be found at Depot Heights Shopping Centre and opens till 9pm on weekdays. They serve a variety of seafood soup with interesting renditions of sliced fish. Think pomfret and well, grouper.\nGrouper is delectable, broth is sweet and made even more flavourful with the addition of seafood such as prawns. So I\u2019d say the broth is slightly richer than the usual sliced fish soup. Although slightly pricier than normal sliced fish soup, you\u2019ve gotta admit it\u2019s pretty value for money considering the addition of seafood.\nA.S Seafood Soup: 412 Bedok North Ave 2, Singapore 460412\n7.\u00a0127 Lor 1 Fish soup, Fish porridge, Seafood soup \u9c7c\u7ca5\u9c7c\u6c64\u6d77\u9c9c\u6c64\nPhoto Credits: ieatandeat.com\nSliced Fish Soup ($4). The sliced fish is cut evenly and well, fresh of course. It is tender and the broth compliments the fish with its\u2019 creamy and luscious flavour. It retains its\u2019 sweet undertone amidst the milk.\u00a0This stall serves other dishes as well, offering fried fish meat options and also dumplings.\n127 Lorong 1 Fish Soup: Block 127 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, Toa Payoh West Market and Food Court #02-33, Singapore 310127\n8. First Street Teo Chew Fish Soup\nSliced Batang Fish Soup ($5). Although this is slightly on the pricey side as well, it is well worth the money. They have a wide variety of fish to choose from, yet again. Pomfret, grouper etc and you can choose to have it with either meesua, rice or beehoon. How versatile.\nThe broth is Teo Chew style, clear simple and sweetened by the addition of seafood. A serving size of it is generous and if you in the mood to laden your broth up with more flavours, ask for minced meat to be added for that extra oomph.\nFirst Street Teo Chew Fish Soup: 1014 Upper Serangoon Road, Hiap Seng Hup Kee Eating House, Singapore 534752\n9. (Green Signboard) Pig\u2019s Organ Soup / Fish Soup @ Alexander Village\nPhoto: Zitseng.com\nFish Soup with rice ($4.50). This stall has no name to it, just a green signboard humbly listing what it has to offer its\u2019 customers in Alexander Village. It is located in the same area as Poh Cheu Ang Ku Kueh. Well, it needs no introduction because it is fairly popular and there is always a snaking line for it. It is well known for its\u2019 pig organ soup and fish soup, so here it is.\nYou can choose to have it with white or yam rice with the latter being a heavy option with little yam chunks in it. For anyone looking for a lighter option, choose the former. The fish soup is aromatic and dense in flavour owing to the milk content and the fish is fragrant. This will make for a heartier meal than the light broth counterparts.\nGreen Signboard Pig\u2019s Organ Soup / Fish Soup: 127 Bukit Merah Lane 1, Alexander Village, Singapore 150124\n10. Chai Ji Fish Soup \u8d22\u8bb0\nSliced Grouper Soup ($5). I decided to go for the grouper and I had no regrets for that choice. The grouper was much more tender than the batang fish that I\u2019ve been having, it\u2019s melt in your mouth goodness and also delicious on its\u2019 own.\nThe broth is very clear and light, much more than the usual and this is definitely up my alley because I\u2019ve always fancied light yet flavourful broth that warms up my soul. The ginger lends an invigorating hint of spice but the portion was slightly too small for me. Could use a few more slices of grouper, or I\u2019m really just greedy.\nChai Ji Fish Soup: 209 Hougang Street 21, Kovan Hougang Market and Food Centre, #01-29, Singapore 530209\n11. Seng Kee \u6210\u8bb0\nPhoto: ieatandeat.com\nPhoto: ieatandeat.com\nSliced Fish Soup ($3.70). Right at the corner of Bukit Merah Central Market and Food Centre you can find Seng Kee serving up a delicious bowl of fish soup. They have the option of adding the fried egg batter and Hong Kong noodles.\nThis is slightly heavier on taste as well, with a dense bowl of noodles and fried goods that mixes savoury with the sweetness of the broth. The addition of milk gives a delectable taste together with the generous presence of vegetables. A reasonably priced and hearty bowl I\u2019d say.\nSeng Kee: Block 163 Bukit Merah Central, Bukit Merah Central Food Centre #02-56, Singapore 150163\n12. Han Kee \u6f22\u8bb0\nSliced Fish Soup ($5). Another stellar fish soup stall at Amoy Street Food Centre, Han Kee serves up a much gentler and clearer broth that is heartwarming. The slight coriander taste lends an extra punch of fragrance. The fish is cut thick and very fresh, none of that fishy smell about it. It is flavoursome on it\u2019s own and even sweeter when paired with the broth.\nHan Kee will be your go-to stall for a bowl of sliced fish soup\u00a0if you decide to be kind on your waistline for any reason you desire. Do note that Han Kee and Piao Ji literally have a snaking line during lunchtime, so be prepared to wait.\nHan Kee:\u00a07 Maxwell Road, Amoy Street Food Centre, #02-129, Singapore 069111\n* indicates required\nEmail Address *\nFirst Name\n$10 off promo code on dining vouchers\nGet $10 off over 600 dining vouchers from ChopeDeals when you subscribe to our free mailing list!\nName\nEmail\nRelated\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nAbout\nSETHLUI.COM is a Singapore Food, Travel, Nightlife online publication with more than 3 million page views each month.

            "16 Best Carrot Cakes That You Should Not Miss!\nLast updated on October 20th, 2018,\n16 Best Carrot Cake Stalls That You Should Not Miss!\nNot to be confused with the ang moh kind of dessert, the greasy, pan-fried carrot cake can be eaten at any time of the day. Some prefer their chai tow kway to be wetter and eggier, while others prefer their kueh to be softer. Looking for the best carrot cake in Singapore? Whether you\u2019re a die-hard fan of the sweet black chai tow kway, or the savoury white version, you should definitely try these sixteen chai tow kway.\n1. 618 Sim Carrot Cake\nProbably the best carrot cake in Yishun (and the north), 618 Sim Carrot Cake serves up a really unique plate of carrot cake ($3). The chye poh here is actually placed on the side of the plate. The preserved radish is crunchy, and not overly salty. Neither pork nor lard is used in the preparation of the dish. On another occasion, we went back again and tried the carrot cake with prawns ($4.50). The prawns were diced into small pieces and fried together with the carrot cake and chives.\n618 Sim Carrot Cake\nOpening Hours: 7am to 2pm, closed on Tuesdays.\n2. Ang Moh Kio 107 Carrot Cake\nThe carrot cake here has been rated as one of the \u201cTop 10 Carrot Cake\u201d in Singapore. Both white and black versions are available at either $3 or $4. The carrot cake was moist and soft. The elderly uncle is not stingy with the chye poh (preserved radish), eggs and garlic. There\u2019s a good crunch in every bite of the fragrant carrot cake.\nAng Moh Kio 107 Carrot Cake\nAddress: Blk 107 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, Singapore 560107\nOpening Hours: 6pm to 11pm. Closed on Wednesdays, Saturdays & Sundays.\n3. Bukit Merah View Carrot Cake\nThe stall has been in business for over 60 years, and the hawker still painstakingly makes carrot cake the traditional way. Bukit Merah View\u2019s Carrot Cake comes in chunks that have a crispy exterior. The black carrot cake ($3) had just the right amount of sweetness, and was nicely charred. I preferred the white carrot cake ($3) as there were more consistent charred bits, making this plate of chai tow kway more fragrant.\nBukit Merah View Carrot Cake\nAddress: Blk 115 Bukit Merah View, Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre, #01-37, Singapore 151115\nOpening Hours: 7am to 2pm daily.\n4. Chey Sua Carrot Cake\nChey Sua only does white carrot cake. They will pan fry one side of the carrot cake till crispy, while leaving the other side only lightly fried. Unlike most carrot cake stalls where the chilli is placed on the side, Chey Sua actually pan fries the chilli together with the crispy surface. Grace and Shirley, who have taken over the family business over 20 years ago, insist on making their own radish cake. Shirley said that factory-made ones may be too soft or too hard sometimes, so by making her own, she can ensure consistency.\nChey Sua Carrot Cake\nAddress: #02-30, Toa Payoh West Market and Food Court, 127 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh\nOpening Hours: Tue \u2013 Sun 6am to 1pm, closed on Mon\n5. Fried Carrot Cake\nThis unnamed stall is known for being the go-to stall for Clementi residents who crave a good plate of carrot cake. Run by a husband and wife duo, the stall attracts snaking queues in the morning. The white carrot cake ($3) is on the eggier side and the kueh is firm with a spicy kick in every bite.\nFried Carrot Cake\nAddress: Blk 448 Clementi Ave 3, Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre, #01-45, Singapore 120448\nOpening Hours: 6am to 12pm. Closed every Monday.\n6. Fu Ming Cooked Food\nAlso known as the \u2018mickey mouse carrot cake\u2019, the carrot cake from Fu Ming is named as such due to the signboard having cute Mickey Mouse on it! Each bite-sized piece of carrot cake is bigger than usual, which allowed us to taste the soft texture of the cake and the flavour of the radish. I love those big egg pieces and the sweetness of the black sweet sauce. Apparently, they add sweet sauce twice. We noticed that the stall steams their own carrot cake! $3 for this plate of goodness is a real steal.\nFu Ming Cooked Food\nAddress: Redhill Food Centre, Blk 85 Redhill Lane #01-49, Singapore 150085\nOpening Hours: Mon to Sat 3pm-1am, Sun 6am-1am\n7. Ghim Moh Carrot Cake\nGhim Moh Carrot Cake still makes their kueh themselves. The $4 plate of Yuan Yang contains both white and black carrot cake. The pan-fried fragrance of the white carrot cake was stronger, and the black carrot cake leaned towards the drier side. Overall, a well-balanced plate of carrot cake.\nGhim Moh Carrot Cake\nAddress: Blk 20 Ghim Moh Road, Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, #01-16, Singapore 270020\nOpening Hours: 730am to sold out (around 1230pm). Closed on Mondays.\n8. Good Spice Carrot Cake\nThis is arguably one of the cheapest carrot cakes on the list, and possibly in the market too. A plate of carrot cake starts from $2, and the Yuan Yang is only $3. The carrot cake here is very old school. The kueh is extremely soft \u2014 almost becoming nua and indistinguishable. The egg in the white carrot cake was cooked like an omelette with a slightly watery texture. The black carrot cake was a lot less salty than the white version, with the perfect level of sweetness. I cannot decide which one I like more!\nGood Spice Carrot Cake\nAddress: Pek Kio Market and Food Centre, 44 Owen Rd, Singapore 210044\nOpening Hours: 6am to sold out (around 12-1pm). Closed on Wednesdays.\n9. Guan Hin Homemade Carrot Cake\nAt the stall, you will see huge round aluminium trays filled with homemade carrot cake. Everyday, the old couple makes the kueh in the stall, cuts it up into huge chunks and fries them upon order. Each piece of carrot cake is chunky and stir fried with garlic and preserved radish. I preferred the black version which is mixed with a thick and rich black sweetened sauce. The uncle is generous with the eggs too!\nAddress: Geylang Bahru Market & Food Centre #01-45, 69 Geylang Bahru, Singapore 330069\nOpening Hours: 10am to 4pm. Closed on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.\n10. Guan Kee Carrot Cake\nThe carrot cake at Guan Kee is wetter, and more savoury. Even the conventionally dry white carrot cake is moist here! The portion of the Yuan Yang($4) is pretty substantial. The kueh here is thick, chunky, and firm. I preferred the black version as it was nicely moist, and not too sweet!\nGuan Kee Carrot Cake\nAddress: 70 Queen Street, #01-59, Singapore 180270 Queen St, Singapore 180270\nOpening Hours: 730am to 230pm, 5pm go 9pm. Closed on Monday.\n11. He Zhong Carrot Cake\nThis family-run carrot cake stall has been at Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre since 1973. This stall only does white carrot cake and the carrot cake comes in big and chunky pieces, unlike the usual flat pancake style! These springy chunks of goodness are very flavourful, with a strong garlicky aroma and fragrance of fish sauce. The generous amount of chai poh studded throughout the cake gives a sweetness that complements the savouriness perfectly. Another thing that I like about the carrot cake here is that the stall makes their own kueh, according to their own special recipe, daily. The carrot cake is very affordable, with the smallest portion starting at just $2.50.\nHe Zhong Carrot Cake\nAddress: #02-185 Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre, 51 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 588215\nOpening Hours: Wednesday 6am to 1pm, Thursdays to Tuesdays 6am to 8.30pm\n12. Lau Goh Teochew Chye Thow Kway\nLau Goh started from a pushcart, along Merchant Road, in the 60s. If you are like me, who cannot decide to have the white or black version, you can just order this dual carrot cake ($5). They are very generous with eggs. Vegetable oil is used, instead of lard, so the carrot cake is slightly healthier.\nLau Goh Teochew Chye Thow Kway\nAddress: 70 Zion Road, Stall 26 Zion Riverside Food Centre.\nOpening Hours: Mon to Sat 12pm \u2013 2pm and 7pm \u2013 11pm; Sun 10am \u2013 3pm and 6pm \u2013 11pm. Closed on Tue\n13.Lin Hai Sheng Carrot Cake\nThe family behind this stall owns a factory dedicated to making the yummy, soft kueh. Only white carrot cake is sold here, with no added vegetable oil, hence the carrot cake is less oily than that of many places. The queue get rather crazy during mealtimes!\nLin Hai Sheng Carrot Cake\nAddress: Blk 724 AMK Ave 6 AMK Central Mkt & Cooked Food Centre\n#01-09.\n14. Song Zhou Carrot Cake\nThe stall was started by Mdm Qiu\u2019s dad, and she has been helping at the stall since she was young. Now, her husband and her have taken over the stall. They used to only sell white carrot cake, but as more youngsters love the black rendition, they started to fry black carrot cake too. Even though they no longer make their own carrot cake, they add some \u201csecret\u201d ingredients to make the kueh softer after receiving it from their supplier. Song Zhou\u2019s black carrot cake is very, very fragrant and moist. Each piece of kueh is so soft and aromatic. The stall is very generous with the eggs and black sauce. Each plate of carrot cake starts from $2.50.\nAddress: Blk 207 Bedok North Interchange #01-18\nOpening Hours: Monday to Saturday 7am to 8pm, closed on Sundays\n15. Tiong Bahru Kampung Carrot Cake\nThe uncle was a roadside hawker at Tanjong Pagar Railway Centre, before he moved to the current location at Tiong Bahru market. He has been operating for over 30 years! The carrot cake was thick, but soft, and almost mushy. The chai poh taste was quite strong, and especially so in the white version.\nTiong Bahru Kampung Carrot Cake\nAddress: 30 Seng Poh Rd, Tiong Bahru Market, #02-53, Singapore 168898\nOpening Hours: 630am to 2pm daily.\n16. Yuan Cheng Carrot Cake\nIn an attempt to be \u2018healthier\u2019, Yuan Cheng uses vegetable oil in their carrot cake. Both the black and white versions at Yuan Cheng are stellar, and you will find long queues at the stall on weekend mornings. The white carrot cake is blander, as compared to the black version, but its very eggy. I prefer the black rendition as it was more flavourful. There are also hidden charred bits in the black carrot cake! Very shiok! A plate of carrot cake starts from $2.50.\nYuan Cheng Carrot Cake\nAddress: 79 Telok Blangah Drive, Telok Blangah Drive Food Centre, #01-33, Singapore 100079\nOpening Hours: 6am to 2pm daily.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re craving for a piping hot plate of fragrant carrot cake now.

            "Fried oyster omelette, or as the locals call it, orh ah jian, is a savoury dish that you can easily find in hawker centres all over Singapore.\u00a0Juicy, fresh oysters atop a bed of crispy egg batter fried to perfection, this delicacy is definitely hard to resist!\nThe ingredients of oyster omelette are always the same, so what makes each of these stalls different is the batter they use and the control of the fire\u2014to get a crispy exterior and that signature wok hei flavour. For oyster omelette that will literally change your life, here is our list of 8 oyster omelette stalls in Singapore.\nPhoto Credit: Victor Lee\nAH CHUAN FRIED OYSTER OMELETTE\nDo a google search on the best oyster omelettes and you can easily find Ah Chuan Fried Oyster Omelette on the list. Located within Kim Keat Palm Market and Food Centre, this long-established stall has made a name for itself with its traditional oyster omelette.\nThe dense crisp of the fried omelette makes it extra savoury and the generous amount of juicy, fresh oysters they put in makes every bite of this dish a wonderful delight. Be sure to be there early if you want to get your hands on the tasty orh jian because this stall only operates for about 3 hours each day.\nBlk 22 Toa Payoh Lorong 7,\nSingapore 310022\nClosed on Tuesdays\nQuit the calorie counting and order up a plate of this eggy, starchy dish dotted with plump, saline oysters at Ang Sa Li, which is located at the famous Chomp Chomp Food Centre. Each bite of the omelette reveals a good blend of crispy and chewy starch bits, accompanied by coriander leaves and a tangy chilli sauce at the side.\nOnce the starch is crispy, the oysters are added and the pan bursts into tongues of fire that lick the luscious molluscs with its smoky aroma!\u00a0The zesty chilli sauce that accompanied this brilliant omelette packed a punch, which really cut through the distinct briny flavour of the oysters.\n20 Kensington Park Road\nNearest Station: Serangoon\nBEDOK 85 FRIED OYSTER OMELETTE\nOyster lovers, you are in for a treat! The folks at Bedok 85 Fried Oyster Omelette offers a generous amount of unbelievably plump and fresh oysters which are fried together with the yummy eggs batter.\nWe liked that the egg\u00a0was evenly mixed for a consistent omelette that is fried over a large fire for that crispy edge and fluffy texture within. The huge oysters are not overly pan-fried, thus leaving them moist and plump, which added a nice bite to it.\n85 Bedok North Street 4\n#01-09/10 85 Fengshan Centre\nNearest Station: Bedok Reservoir\nCHENG JI XIA MIAN HAO JIAN\nLocated in the very accessible Seah Im Food Centre, Cheng Ji Xia Mian Hao Jian might be well known for their Hokkien Mee but their Oyster Omelette puts up a good fight as well.\nFried till the edges are slightly crisp and golden brown, each mouthful of oyster omelette brings out a marriage of flavours especially with the fresh oysters and their homemade chilli sauce at the side.\n2 Seah Im Road\nSingapore 099114\nNearest Station: Harbourfront\n49A Serangoon Garden Way\nSingapore 555945\nSat & Sun: 7.15am \u2013 3pm\nHUAT HENG FRIED OYSTER\nFeatured in the Michelin Guide Singapore, Huat Heng Fried Oyster has made a name for itself for its traditional oyster omelette. Situated in Whampoa Drive Hawker Centre that is well known for good food, this place certainly lives up to the standards\u2013worthy of being mentioned in the Michelin Guide.\nStarch is mixed into the egg batter while whipping up the omelette, which gives it a thick consistency. Each bite was brimming with wok hei and the fat and juicy oysters they give for each plate makes every bite an absolute joy. Shout out to the chilli that is sour enough to cut through the grease without being harsh on the palate.\n90 Whampoa Drive #01-26\nNearest Station: Novena\nLIM\u2019S FRIED OYSTER OMELETTE\nHaving been around for 4 decades now, Lim\u2019s Fried Oyster Omelette brings a nostalgic feel that makes it stand out amongst the others. Furthermore, the plump and succulent oysters they use are freshly imported from Korea, which is larger as compared to other stalls.\nEach bite of the oyster omelette was made up of crispy and charred skin, enveloping a chunk of gooey potato starch. What is lovely about this place is that they add a hint of chilli sauce\u2013one that brims with a fragrant aroma of dried shrimps\u2013to the mix while frying, and an additional side of the piquant chilli sauce as a dip on the side.\n166 Jalan Besar\nNearest Station: Jalan Besar\nPhoto Credit: Ian Low\nSIMON ROAD OYSTER OMELETTE\nTucked in an unassuming corner of Simon Road, Simon Road Oyster Omelette has gained a loyal fan base for having been around for more than 30 years. Mr Lim Poh Pin now helms the stall, after his father passed away last year. Even though the taste was not quite on par with the standards of his dad\u2019s, it is definitely getting there.\nWonderfully crispy and bursting with savoury flavour, the ratio of eggs to starch is just perfect, well proportioned to give a balanced taste. The oysters were sufficiently plump and juicy, which gave a gastronomic blend of crisp and soft texture from the omelette and oysters.\n941 Upper Serangoon Road\nClosed on Mondays\nNearest Station: Kovan\nA D D  C O M M E N T\nTop Stories\n"

            "25th September 2018\nAffordable popiah places to check out in Singapore\nA popular dish among many, there is just something innately satisfying about sinking your teeth into a roll of plump and juicy popiah. In Teochew, \u2018popiah\u2019 means \u2018thin pancake\u2019 \u2013 representative of the paper-thin popiah skin made from wheat flour that wraps around a filling of cooked jicama, vegetables and prawns. A deep-fried version of the popiah is the spring roll. For your next popiah fix, check out these popiah places around Singapore!\n1. Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Original Popiah & Kueh Pie Tee\nIf you are a true popiah lover, then you really have no excuse for not having tried popiah at Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Original Popiah & Kueh Pie Tee. They are halal-certified and have been around since 1938. Each Popiah goes at $2.50.\nIf you prefer to DIY your own popiah, you can order a claypot of popiah ingredients that comes with a free-flow of their housemade popiah skins. For those interested in how they make their paper-thin popiah crepes, you can head down on weekends to watch the popiah skin makers from 8:30am to 11am.\nAddress: 54 Joo Chiat Place, Singapore 427778\nOpening hours: Daily 9am to 2pm\nTel: 9620 2000\n2. Glory Catering\nImage credit: @peklay_snoopy_ye\nGlory Catering focuses on serving up simple Peranakan delights. While popiah chains in Singapore are aplenty, Glory Catering distinguishes themselves by their sauce \u2013 so if the sauce is your favourite part of the popiah, then the popiah here is for you. Though $3 per Popiah may seem like a bit of a stretch, you will not be left feeling shortchanged with their fresh ingredients used.\nOne other feature of Glory\u2019s popiah is that instead of using the typical wheat flour popiah skin, they use egg roll wrappers instead. With a stronger eggy taste, the skin is also chewier and feels almost \u2018elastic\u2019.\nAddress: 139 East Coast Road, Singapore 428829\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 8:30am to 8:30pm\nTel: 6344 1749\nFortune Food prides themselves on their quality handmade popiah skin, and have both delivery and self-pickup options. With egg yolks as the main protein source, their popiah party set goes at $24 for 15 rolls. Although they started as a hawker stall in Geylang Bahru, they are now suppliers to other popiah stalls in hawker centres.\nFortune Food has expanded to include kueh pie ti ($28 for 50 pieces), ayam koro bun \u2013 braised chicken thighs in steamed buns ($32 for 15 pieces), muah chee ($28 for 50 servings), and even laksa ($43 for 18-20 bowls) in their catering menu. There will definitely something for everyone.\nAddress: 3017 Bedok North Street 5, #01-13, Gourmet East Kitchen, Singapore 468121\nOpening hours: Daily 8am to 6pm\nTel: 6243 2118\nGood Chance Popiah Eating House is a third-generation family business that opened more than 30 years ago. They specialise in Hokkien-style popiah. What makes Hokkien popiah different is that the jicama mixture that fills the popiah consists of bamboo shoots, carrots, long beans and dried shrimp \u2013 which may not be found in traditional rolls. The chilli served here has a tinge of ma la spice that leaves a slight numbing sensation on your lips.\nThe Small DIY Popiah Set is priced at $19.90 and is good for six rolls of popiah. If you want more premium ingredients, you can add $4.80 for lup cheong and $6.80 for prawns or crab meat. Good Chance also offers several other iconic zi char dishes like Dark Hokkien Mee ($8.80).\nAddress: Block 149 Silat Avenue, #01-58, Singapore 160149\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 11am to 2:30pm, 6pm to 9:30pm\nTel: 6271 0698\nOld Long House Popiah is one of the oldest popiah shops in Singapore. Their housemade popiah skin is delectably soft and chewy. One thing unique about this popiah eatery is their addition of crispy golden bits to the popiah roll. These bits replace peanuts to add texture and a crunch to the dish.\nIf you are thinking of hosting a popiah party, Old Long House also sells their skin and fillings for DIY popiah as well.\nAddress: 22 Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, #01-03, Kim Keat Palm Market & Food Centre, Singapore 310022\nOpening hours: Wed-Sun 6am to 2pm\nTel: 9171 7157\nLocated in the heart of Chinatown, Ann Chin Popiah was first introduced in 1958 by Mr Lim Kam Chwee. If you like your popiah to be a little on the sweeter side, Ann Chin\u2019s popiah would be your choice. Each roll of Popiah ($1.60 per roll) is fresh and made-to-order. Ann Chin also recently introduced their Fried Spring Rolls ($1.60 per piece) that are offered in three distinct flavours \u2013 Yam, Radish and Curry. The Popiah Party Set go at $32, while their Kueh Pie Tee Party Set go at $42.\nAddress: 530 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Singapore 560530\nOpening hours: Daily 9am to 8pm\nTel: 8189 4699\nAs its name suggests, My Cosy Corner is tucked away in a corner of Coronation Plaza and gives off a snug ambience. They specialise in serving good old-fashioned Nyonya cuisine.\nThe Popiah ($2.50) here is fragrant and packed with well-seasoned ingredients. Though some may see $2.50 as a little overpriced for popiah, but for its flavour, you may even pay for one more! If you feel like having a more substantial meal, they also offer Japanese set meals and local delights like mee siam and mee rebus.\nAddress: 587 Bukit Timah Road, Coronation Shopping Plaza, Singapore 269707\nOpening hours: Mon-Sat 10am to 7pm, Sun 11am to 4pm\nTel: 6463 8286\nIf you ask the residents in Upper Thomson where to go for good popiah, they will be sure to point you to Ping Kee Popiah. The Popiah here is sold at $1.50 per roll. The unique addition of lup cheong to the popiah roll is what makes Ping Kee stand out amongst other popiah eateries. Do ask for more chilli to add an extra kick to your popiah roll as their chilli is rather mild.\nAddress: 590 Upper Thomson Road, #01-32, Sembawang Hill Food Centre, Singapore 574419\nOpening hours: Sat-Thur 11:30am to 8pm\n9. 968 Popiah\nImage credit: @rei_qi\n968 Popiah is a humble hawker stall in Whampoa. However, they offer not only the option of a standard Popiah ($1.40), but also the more unique Sushi Popiah ($2.20).\nWhile there are other places which sell sushi popiah, the filling is typically a vegetable salad but at 968 Popiah, the filling is almost identical to that of the standard popiah. The difference is that below the popiah skin, a sheet of nori seaweed was laid under it to imitate the maki sushi. Their housemade chilli had roughly chopped fresh garlic mixed in and added an added kick to the dish.\nAddress: 81 Whampoa Drive, #01-893, Quek Hong Chuan Eating House, Singapore 320081\nOpening hours: Daily 12pm to 8pm\nTel: 9648 9350\nPopiah at Jit It Thai Sun Popiah is sold at $1.80 per roll. The popiah skin is chewy and is able to hold the ingredients together well without going soggy too fast. The popiah here is on a slightly sweeter side than most, but is well complemented with the savoury filling and chilli sauce. Warning: the chilli from Jit It Thai Sun gives a fiery kick so add more at your own risk.\nAddress: 449 Clementi Avenue 3, #01-211, Singapore 120449\nOpening hours: Daily 12pm to 9pm\nBonus 1: Souperstar\nImage credit: @souperstarsg\nSouperstar is owned by two sisters who used to help at their parent\u2019s family business \u2013 Fortune Food, which specialises in popiah skins. The \u201cpopiah\u201d at Souperstar is more similar to that of a wrap, but still very much reminiscent of the traditional popiah. Popular orders here are the Traditional Popiah ($2.50) and Thai Chicken Popiah ($3.80). They are rolled tight and served unsliced, which helps in preventing a mess while you eat.\nAddress: 7 Wallich Street, #B2-31, Tanjong Pagar Centre, Singapore 078884\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri 8am to 9pm, Sat 10am to 8pm, Sun 10:30am to 7pm\nMr. Popiah was first introduced in 1995 at a humble coffee shop at Bedok North. Overtime, Mr. Popiah attracted and kept loyal customers who frequent their shop for the delicious popiah and the wide range of customisable popiahs that only Mr. Popiah offers.\nMr. Popiah offers a unique option of Sushi Popiah ($4) \u2013 popiah wrapped with jicama and vegetable salad with Japanese sauce, and Salted Egg Prawns Popiah ($5) that puts an interesting spin on the traditional popiah. If you prefer to stick to a popiah that you may be more familiar with, order their Nyonya Popiah ($2.70).\nAddress: 53 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, #03-12, Ang Mo Kio Hub NTUC Foodfare, Singapore 569933\nOpening hours: Daily 10am to 10pm\nTel: 8288 4598\nCheck out these places to satisfy your popiah cravings\nPopiah has always been one of the comfort food that I always turn to, but I always feel that it has not gotten enough credit for its worth. It is one of those snacks that are so customisable and versatile. From an in-between meal snack to a appetiser to even a meal if you\u2019re looking for something light, it only depends on how ravenous you feel that day.\n140\nSHARES\nYou Might Also Like\n3rd December 2018\nSubscribe & Follow\n21 hours ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\n6 days ago\n7 days ago\n1 week ago\n"

            "13th April 2018\nDry beef noodles for rainy days\nBeing Teochew and a lover of soups, I grew up eating soup beef noodles. On the other hand, my boyfriend always ordered the dry beef noodles, which he claims is the best way to enjoy beef noodles. I was initially skeptical, but after trying the starchy Hainanese version, I understood what he meant. Since my first taste of dry beef noodles, I rarely went back to the soupy, Teochew verison. Here are 10 dry beef noodles stalls for all you beef noodles lover!\n1. Hong Kee Beef Noodles\nAwarded Michelin\u2019s Bib Gourmand for two years running, Hong Kee Beef Noodles has a long history of satisfying tummies with their Dry Beef Noodles ($5/$6). The noodles are gently laced with a gooey, dark gravy and paired with crunchy bean sprouts, which lend a contrasting texture to the al dente noodles. Melting in my mouth like butter were the tender beef slices. Don\u2019t be deceived by the broth that looks thinner than the rest on the list \u2013 it still packed tons of flavour and was a delight to lap up!\nAddress: 7 Maxwell Road, #01-42, Amoy Street Food Centre, Singapore 069111\nOpening hours: Mon\u2013Fri 11am to 7:30pm , Sat\u2013Sun 9am to 2:30pm\n2.

Each bowl of their Dry Sliced Beef Noodles ($4) comes with springy rice noodles and a generous amount of pinkish beef slices. It is topped off with thick, savoury gravy, and a pinch of ground peanuts for added crunch. The star of the show is their house-made chilli sauce. Remember to add a squeeze of lime juice and their piquant chilli to uplift the robust flavour of this dish!\nAddress: 505 Beach Road, #01-89, Golden Mile Food Centre, Singapore 199583\nOpening hours: Daily 11am to 10pm\n3. Toa Payoh Hwa Heng Beef Noodles\nThe constant long queues at Toa Payoh Hwa Heng Beef Noodles always turned me off. Thankfully, my boyfriend decided to be nice and braved the queue for me to try their Dry Mixed Beef Noodles ($4). Packed with four beef balls, slices of tender beef, tripe, and brisket, this bowl of mee that\u2019s drenched in dark brown sauce has since been my weakness. The noodles absorbed the essence of the beef gravy, and was a joy to slurp up.\nAddress: 29 Bendemeer Road, #01-01, Bendemeer Food Centre, Singapore 330029\nOpening hours: Wed-Sun 10am to 2:30pm\n4.

As you dig in to the thick, almost opaque sauce, you will discover a massive amount of beef and noodles hidden beneath. Giving depth to the moreish bowl of noodles were the topping off fried shallots, ground peanuts and cilantro.\nAddress: 47 Tai Thong Crescent, Kin Seng Coffeeshop, Singapore 347867\nOpening hours: Mon-Sat 11:30am to 6pm\n5. Hong Heng Beef Noodles And Laksa\nA quick walk from Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, Hong Heng Beef Noodles And Laksa is probably one of the lesser known stalls on this list. From $4.50, you get to enjoy a hearty bowl of Dry Beef Noodles which comes with a handful of beef slices, all coated in a delicious sauce that\u2019s thick and gooey. What sets this stall apart from its competitors is their Mixed Beef Laksa ($5.50/$6/$7).\nAddress: 226H Ang Mo Kio Street 22, #01-16, Kebun Baru Market & Food Centre, Singapore 568226\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 7:30am to 3:30pm\n6.

The different textures add a new dimension to the simple dish, while the varying flavours complement each other well. Indulge in their Soup Mix Beef Noodle ($5) to enjoy their flavourful broth that\u2019s made from scratch daily and left to simmer for at least eight hours.\nAddress: 520 North Bridge Road, #01-01, Wisma Alsagoff, Singapore 188742\nOpening hours: Mon-Sat 11am to 10:30pm\n7.

China Square\nImage credit: @simbocun\nWalk pass China Square, and you will be greeted with a robust aroma wafting through the air.

They do both their Dry Hainan Beef Noodles ($4/$5) drenched in a rich dark gravy and Soup Hainan Beef Noodles ($4/$5) extremely well. This is all thanks to their succulent beef, QQ beef balls that are firm to bite, and slippery smooth noodles.\nAddress: 22 Lorong 7 Toa Payoh, #01-06, Kim Keat Palm Market & Food Centre, Singapore 310022\nOpening hours: Tue-Sun 8am to 7pm\n10.

            "Hai Nan Xing Zhou Beef Noodles:  Damien\u2019s Favourite Beef Noodles!\nPosted on: October 11, 2007\nWith smart, liverpool, bashfulhunter, iwatch_ueat, damien and PowerAunty\nBeef Kway Teow Dry $4\nAccording to Damien, this stall sells the BEST beef kway teow in Singapore. Better than all the rest. So we had to make our pilgrimage down to Toa Payoh to try it. The stall is supposed to be opened till 7pm, so we thought that 2.30pm should be quite a safe time to visit. Lo and Behold, there was a queue of some 20 something people lining up for the Beef Kway Teow! It so happens that the day we went there was exactly the day after Channel 8 featured the stall. So by the time we got to the front of the queue, they were already sold out on the gravy for the dry version!\nI wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily, so I made a return visit the following week just to try the dry Beef Kway Teow. This time I got what I wanted. Or did I?\nI was undoubtedly impressed with the stewed beef tendons which were so soft it explodes in your mouth, coating your buccal cavity with its soft and gooey goodness. The beef slices were tender but the beef balls were outsourced, so they were not that special. The sauce itself was good, but maybe my expectations were too high, it did not have that oomph if you ask me. However, one lady who was a regular at the stall confirmed that the gravy that day tasted a bit watered down. I suspect that it could be due to the higher volume sold during the past week. But for now it rates a 4.25/5. Damien and other regulars of this stall might beg to differ.\nThe beef soup on the other hand was wonderfully robust and sweet and definitely one of the best I have tasted. 4.5/5\nThis Hainanese man has been selling Hainanese Style Beef Kway Teow for over 40 years. He is still remembered as the Beef Kway Teow stall from Cuppage Centre. When I asked where he learned his recipe from, he simply said that he derived it through experimentation.\nConclusion\nAnother Beef Kway Teow to add onto the Top Beef Kway Teow list! Definitely one of the better ones around which I am sure many fans will write in to support.\nHai Nan Xing Zhou Beef Noodles\nAddress:\nOpening hours:\nClosed:\nMondays\nComment\nName *\nEmail *\nWebsite\nLeslie\u00a0Tay\nLike my Facebook page to get my latest food finds and recipes!\nDiscover good eats and hidden gems on\nInteresting Links\nConnect With Me\n"

            "Credit : aaudreyylee @ Instagram\nSingaporeans love Hokkien Mee. In contrast to the Malaysian version which uses dark soy sauce and thick noodles, the Singaporean version uses yellow noodles with bee hoon and is cooked with pork or prawn stock. We have gathered 10 best Hokkien Noodles in Singapore. Let\u2019s see which stall makes it to the list!\n1. Tian Tian Lai (Come Daily) Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee\nCredit : cknchowmein @ Instagram\nCredit : comedailyfhpm @ Facebook\nTian Tian Lai (Come Daily) is considered to be one of the top 3 best Hokkien Mee in Singapore. Singaporeans and even tourists come here for its flavourful and strong prawn stock. The crispy fried pork fats complement really well with the cooked rice noodles and egg noodles. The \u201cwok hei\u201d will definitely wow you with each bite. No wonder people are willing to queue for at least 45 minutes to 1 hour for a plate of hokkien noodles, especially during peak hours on weekends.\nAddress: Blk 127, Lorong 1 Toa Payoh #02-27, Singapore 310127\nTel: +65 9671 7071\nOpening Hours: 8am \u2013 2:30pm (Tuesday to Sunday); Closed on Monday\n2. \u00a0Ah Hock Fried Hokkien Noodles\nCredit : 17x_eh @ Instagram\nSituated at Chomp Chomp Food Centre, Ah Hock serves a drier version of fried hokkien mee when compared to the usual ones. Instead of using pork lard, Ah Hock uses pork and prawn stock to cook the broth for an aromatic taste. The noodles are fried until all the broth is absorbed. Served with their special chilli sauce, this plate of Hokkien Mee will make you crave for more.\nAddress: 57 Garden Way, Chomp Chomp Food Centre Stall 27 Serangoon Gardens, Singapore\nOpening Hours: 5.30pm \u2013 12am (Wednesday to Monday); Closed on Tuesday\n3. Geylang Lor 29 Fried Hokkien Mee\nCredit : aaudreyylee @ Instagram\nDon\u2019t be deceived by its name, Geylang Lor 29 is actually located at East Coast Road. It is operated by the brother of the original stall at Geylang. The main highlight is that it still uses the traditional charcoal fire to fry the noodle, thus giving the noodle a strong \u201cwok hei\u201d fragrance. So it might take around 20 to 30 minutes for the chef to prepare your dish. If you\u2019re a seafood lover, this might be the place for you as a generous amount of fresh prawns and squids are given in each plate. Do note that a regular serving size might be sufficient for 2 persons.\nAddress: 396 East Coast Rd, Singapore 428994\nTel: +65 97331388\nOpening Hours: 11:45am \u2013 9pm (Tuesday to Sunday); Closed on Monday\n4. Swee Guan Hokkien Mee\nCredit : serenanatang @ Instagram\nLocated at Geylang, Swee Guan is the original stall of Geylang Lor 29 (the one we mentioned at #3). The stall\u2019s name was changed to Swee Guan to avoid any confusion. Also cooked using traditional charcoal fire, Swee Guan serves one of the best hokkien noodles in Singapore. It has a similar taste to the one on #3. However, many Singaporeans prefer Swee Guan\u2019s as the \u201cwok hei\u201d and smokiness of each bite is simply amazing.\nAddress: 5 Lor 29 Geylang, Singapore 388060\nTel: +65 98175652\n5. Nam Sing Hokkien Fried Mee\nCredit : scrambleggg @ Instagram\nNam Sing\u2019s Hokkien Mee is a dry version of the usual hokkien mee. One thing worth noting is that it uses thin bee hoon instead of the thick one. The yellow noodles and thin bee hoon soaked in the light and savoury gravy is what people crave for. Served with sliced chilli in soya sauce, the stall\u2019s owner refuses to use sambal chilli as they feel it will cover up the original taste of their signature dish.\nAddress: 51 Old Airport Rd, #01-32, Singapore 390051\nTel: +65 64405340\n6. Hainan Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee\nCredit : missfattybombom @ Instagram\nIf you are a fan of wet hokkien mee, Hainan\u2019s version might not be your cup of tea. It also serves a dry version of hokkien mee. What makes it special is that the stock is left to simmer until all flavours are absorbed into the noodles and bee hoon. You are guaranteed to get a rich and immense smoky flavour in every mouthful. Definitely a must try!\nAddress: 505 Beach Rd, #B1-34 Golden Mile Food Centre, Singapore 199583\nTel: +65 6294 6798\n7. New Ubin Seafood\nCredit : carbiedaphie @ Instagram\nMost of us know that New Ubin Seafood serves delicious US Black Angus Ribeye steaks. However, its Fried Hokkien Mee Special is worth mentioning for those who like a wet and gooey version. The strong seafood stock gives the gravy a savoury taste, just enough for a burst of flavour inside your mouth. Instead of the normal version, New Ubin uses thick bee hoon and thinner yellow noodle for a unique texture.\nAddress: 63 Hillview Ave Lam Soon Industrial Building Level 6 Canteen, Singapore 669569\nTel: +65 9740 6870\nCredit : weeneeth @ Instagram\nBelieve it or not \u2013 considered to be one of the best in Singapore, Xiao Di\u2019s Hokkien Mee is actually cooked by a young hawker who is in his late twenties. The noodle is wet and gooey, with a strong \u201cwok hei\u201d fragrance. In addition to the taste of garlic and pork lard, you can definitely taste the prawn stock in every bite of the noodles. Served with Xiao Di\u2019s special chilli sauce, it gives the dish a slightly sour flavour.\nAddress: 153 Serangoon North Ave 1, #01-512, Singapore 550153\nTel: +65 9062 1201\n9. Nam Kee Fried Prawn Noodle\nCredit : kennethxujz @ Instagram\nIf you happen to visit Clementi Hawker Centre, Nam Kee is one that you shouldn\u2019t miss. Well infused with the aromatic seafood stock, the noodles and bee hoon are cooked with a chewy texture. Do note that the queue might be long especially during peak hours. Sometimes it might take at least 20 minutes for the wait. But surely it is worth it!\nAddress: Clementi Ave 3, #01-12 Cement I Market & Food Centre, 448, Singapore 120448\nTel: +65 6779 5736\n10. Kim\u2019s Famous Hokkien Prawn Mee\nCredit : ruff.yen.yong @ Instagram\nSpeaking of Hokkien Mee, most Singaporeans will think about Kim\u2019s place as it has a long history starting from the year 1965. The hokkien mee is cooked just nice, not too soggy nor too dry. They are known to only use fresh seafood ingredients. And have we mentioned that the amount of prawns and squids given are generous? However, some might say that the quality has dropped throughout the years as the taste was not as flavourful as compared to the past.\nAddress: 62B Jln Eunos, Singapore 419510\nTel: +65 6747 8766\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 1am (Daily)\nWhat do you think of the list?

Here are our top 10 best hawker centres in Singapore.\n1. Old Airport Road Food Centre\nCredit : helloyujji @ Instagram\nCredit : shennyyang @ Instagram\nSituated far from Singapore\u2019s city centre, the Old Airport Road Food Centre has been around for more than 30 years and is considered to be one of the best hawker centres on the island. Popular dishes include Hokkien mee from Nam Sing Fried Hokkien Mee, char kway teow from Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow & Lucky Char Kuey Tiao, and silky beancurd pudding from Lao Ban Soya Beancurd & 51 Soya Beancurd. The place is quite hot, so it\u2019s recommended to find a table close to the main road where it is cooler, for an enjoyable meal.\nAddress: 51 Old Airport Rd, Singapore 390051\nTel: +65 6756 0266\n2. Maxwell Food Centre\nCredit : mike.0203 @ Instagram\nLocated in the heart of Chinatown, Maxwell Food Centre is one of the more well-known hawker centres frequented by locals and tourists alike. It was made even more famous after celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay paid a highly-publicised visit to Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Specialities here include Hainanese chicken rice from the aforementioned Tian Tian Chicken Rice, and chicken/fish porridge from Zhen Zhen Porridge. Other great choices include China Street Fritters, Marina South Delicious Food and Hoe Kee Porridge. Do note that most stalls in this hawker centre are closed after 4pm.\nAddress: 1 Kadayanallur St, Singapore 069184\nTel: \u00a0+65 6225 5632\nCredit : gkailyn @ Instagram\nChomp Chomp is a great place for those who love late-night suppers. It is open from the late afternoon until just past midnight; unlike the typical hawker centre opening hours of morning to evening. However, it is located relatively far from the city, in the residential part of Serangoon. Be sure to try out their satay, BBQ sambal stingray, carrot cake, barbecued chicken wings and fried Hokkien mee.\nAddress: 20 Kensington Park Rd, Singapore 557269\nOpening Hours: 4pm \u2013 12.30am (daily)\n4. Tiong Bahru Market Hawker Centre\nCredit : littletraveller_ @ Instagram\nCredit : dianaaatan @ Instagram\nBeing one of the cleanest and most spacious hawker centres in Singapore, Tiong Bahru Market is located just above Tiong Bahru Wet Market. Popular picks that see long queues include Jian Bo Shui Kueh, widely known as one of the best chwee kueh in Singapore. Do not miss out on snacks and baos from Tiong Bahru Pau, and the two popular lor mee stalls: 178 Lor Mee and Tiong Bahru Lor Mee.\nAddress: 30 Seng Poh Rd, Singapore 168898\nOpening Hours: 9am \u2013 8pm (daily)\n5.

It used to be famous for its many stores that sold army equipment, and is thus also known as the \u201carmy market\u201d. Various local dishes ranging from Chinese, Malay, Indian to Thai food can be found in this hawker centre, which spans the first two floors of the building. There are many halal stalls here, mainly located downstairs. Some of the recommended dishes to try include char kway teow, hokkien mee, nasi lemak, burgers and thai food. As some stalls here will close as soon as they are sold out, it\u2019s best to go during breakfast or lunch to avoid disappointment.\nAddress: Golden Mile Food Centre, #01-65, 505 Beach Rd, Singapore 199583\nTel: +65 9129 9832\nCredit : gigglesandjiggles @ Instagram\nBukit Timah Market and Food Centre is a food haven that offers various delicious local dishes. Do try out the signature clear fish soup from Leng Kee. Their fish slices are generous, the soup is made slightly savoury, and you can even add a spoonful of chilli for an extra kick. Another dish worth visiting for is the satay bee hoon from Sin Chew Satay Beehoon. The creamy peanut sauce is actually more savoury than sweet, with the well-balanced taste of spices.\nAddress: 51 Upper Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 588215\nOpening Hours: 7am \u2013 11pm (daily)\n7. Amoy Street Food Centre\nCredit : antho.nguyen_ @ Instagram\nCredit : hndrosantoso @ Instagram\nCredit : talutu @ Instagram\nAnother hawker centre situated in the heart of Chinatown, Amoy Street Food Centre has two floors of hawker stalls.

Chinatown Complex Food Street\nCredit : kanako.i.0923 @ Instagram\nCredit : alfred_she0214 @ Instagram\nCredit : its_me_kurisu @ Instagram\nThe largest hawker centre in Singapore, Chinatown Complex Food Street houses over 260 food stalls that serves various local delights. From the cheapest Michelin dish at Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle to the old-school claypot rice at Zhao Ji Claypot Rice, whatever you can think of can definitely be found here. With fierce competition among the many stalls, the food offered here is often cheaper than usual. How could you miss this?\nAddress: 335, Smith St, Singapore 058938\nOpening Hours: 11am \u2013 11pm (daily)\n9. Hong Lim Food Centre\nCredit : tubzzie @ Instagram\nLocated near Chinatown Complex Food Centre, Hong Lim Food Centre is much quieter and less crowded than its neighbour. So is it worth a stop at this two-storey hawker centre? Hong Lim is home to many established crowd favourites, and even a Michelin Bib Gourmand stall. From curry chicken noodles at Heng Kee Curry Chicken Bee Hoon Mee, all-time-favourite wonton noodles at Ji Ji Wonton Noodle Specialist, to Michelin katong-laksa at Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa (thrice awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand), this is a place you will not regret.\nAddress: 531A Upper Cross St, Singapore 051531\nTel: +65 6225 5632\nCredit : crave2eat @ Instagram\nCredit : cindysweet55 @ Instagram\nDespite being situated in an atas (expensive) area surrounded by private properties, Zion Riverside Food Centre offers surprisingly cheap and reasonable food. While it is one of the smallest food centres in Singapore, Zion Riverside still continues to capture the hearts of locals and tourists alike. Specialities here include char kway teow at No. 18 Zion Road Fried Kway Teow, kway chap at Boon Tong Kee Kway Chap Braised Duck, and fresh prawn mee at Noo Cheng Adam Road Big Prawn Mee.\nAddress: \u00a070 Zion Rd, Singapore 247792\nTel: +65 1800 225 5632\nOpening Hours: 8am \u2013 10pm (daily)\nWhat do you think of our list?

            "Last Updated: June 15, 2017\nCategories\nShares\nI first became acquainted with\u00a0Char Siew \u53c9\u71d2 in primary school when my friend ordered a bowl of Wanton noodles and picked out these reddish slices of meat for me. After that first encounter, I began to explore my options and soon fell in love with the saucy plates of Char Siew Rice and when I was feeling adventurous, I would opt\u00a0for Roasted Pork Noodles.\nThis Cantonese delicacy has worked into the hearts of many and yet many of the\u00a0truly good stalls that serve Char Siew Rice remain more or less obscure to\u00a0the younger generation. And siew, the\u00a0following Char Siew guide has been created (with one or two horrible puns) to help fellow Char Siew lovers navigate their way to quality food. Let the goodness en-siew!\n14. Hua Fong Kee Roasted Duck\nHua Fong Kee Char siew rice ($3.50)\nI visited Hua Fong Kee Roasted Duck around lunchtime\u00a0when the place was teeming with office workers on their mid-day break and while it was slightly tough to find a vacant seat, the servers at the hawker went out of their way to clear tables and\u00a0promptly serve the plate of char siew rice. Unlike many other Char siew stalls, the slices of Char siew served here were thinner and of a smaller portion but they were very generous with the thick syrupy\u00a0sauce\u00a0which is always a bonus!\nHua Fong Kee Roasted Duck: 128 Lor 1 Toa Payoh, Singapore 310128 | Monday to Sunday 0800-2200 | Tel: 6251 5192\n13. \u91d1\u8208\u9999\u6e2f\u71d2\u81d8 Kim Heng\u00a0HK\u00a0Roasted Meat\nKim Heng HK Char Siew rice ($4.30)\nLocated at a more mellow part of Serangoon, Kim Heng Coffeshop houses one of the better Char Siew stalls in Singapore and it is fortunate that this coffeeshop\u00a0was very easily accessible by bus. Kim Heng HK Roasted Meat\u2019s char siew is tender, very flavourful and paired with sweet gravy and chunks of roasted pork belly, the char siew dish was sublime.\nKim Heng HK Roasted Meat: 214 Serangoon Avenue 4, #01-88, Singapore 550214 | Monday to Sunday 0830-1900 | Tel: 6283 3695\n12.\u00a0\u6e58\u8bb0\u70e7\u8089\u53c9\u70e7\u996d Xiang Ji Roasted Meat\nXiang Ji Roasted Meat is one notable Char Siew stall for they serve a good number of Char siew dishes from Wanton noodles to char siew rice. A fragrant roasted sauce is used instead of the conventional dark sauce to make the wanton noodles dish and the char siew they serve is tender, well-marinated and goes very nicely with the slightlysweet but mostly savoury sauce used.\nXiang Ji Roasted Meat: 302 Choa Chu Kang Ave 4, Singapore 680302 | Monday to Sunday 24 hours\n11. Fei Fei Roasted Noodle\nFei Fei Roasted Noodle ($4)\nThe Char Siew at Fei Fei Roasted Noodle is juicy, fatty and simply fantastic for this Cantonese-cuisine-specializing stall refrains from adding red colouring to their meats. Many have the char siew here with noodles which come nicely sauced up and slightly spiced. While this stall is a definite must-try, patrons who seek this plate of goodness out have to be wary of the closing hours of the stall for they run out of char siew rather quickly so make haste, charsiewtons!\nFei Fei Roasted Noodle: #01-28, 254 Jurong East Street 24, Singapore 600254 | Monday to Sunday 0830-Sell Out\n10. Tiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Cantonese Roasted\nTiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Char siew and Sio bak ($3)\nHaving been in the business for a long-time coming, it is impressive to know that the stall owners at Tiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Cantonese Roasted still take pride in maintaining a consistently high quality of the roasted meats they serve. The char siew at this stall is very flavourful and paired with the sweet gravy, one can expect only good things from ordering a plate of Char Siew rice from this stall\nTiong Bahru Lee Hong Kee Cantonese Roasted: 30 Seng Poh Rd, #02-60 | Monday to Sunday: 0900-2000, Closed on Thursdays\n9. Toh Kee\nToh Kee Char Siew and Roasted Duck rice ($6)\nTucked away in the nostalgic setting of Chinatown\u2019s People\u2019s Park food centre,\u00a0Toh Kee and its stall owners serve up scrumptious portions of Char Siew rice which many loyal patrons usually have with the roasted duck. The char siew is nicely charred and sweetened in the appropriate places\u00a0and\u00a0they balance out the crispier slices of roasted duck rather nicely.\nToh Kee Roast Duck: 32 New Market Road, People\u2019s Park Cooked Food Centre, #01-1016A, Singapore 050032 | Tuesday to Sunday 1030-1900, Closed on Mondays| Tel: 6323 3368\n8. Tien Lai Rice Stall\nTien Lai Char siew rice ($2.50)\nFor simply $2.50 a plate, one can get a nice serving of char siew rice is at this more ulu food centre in Jurong, that is completely worth the money. While the char siew they serve here are mostly meaty, flavourful and just splendid, it is advisable to visit this stall earlier at around 1100 to make sure you do not get cuts of meat you\u2019d rather not have. For someone like me who is not exactly a big fan of fatty meats, I find myself getting disappointed when I arrive later and get fattier, less meaty cuts of char siew.\nTien Lai Rice Stall: 3 Yung Sheng Road, Taman Jurong Market and Food Centre, #02-66, Singapore 618499 | Sunday\u00a0to Friday 0930-1300, Closed on Saturdays\u00a0| Tel: 6264 1506\n7. Foong Kee Coffee Shop\nFoong Kee Wanton Noodle ($3.50)\nThe wanton noodle at Foong Kee is probably one of the best I\u2019ve tried so far! Topped with beautifully-roasted char siew, crisp-skinned roast pork and served with nice moist noodles, this dish will\u00a0definitely satiate your appetite and contentment level for a good number of hours. While I may not be a fan of the side of chili that they provide, nothing can hamper my view on how well-cooked and fragrant the char siew dishes they serve there are.\nFoong Kee\u00a0Coffee Shop: 6 Keong Saik Road, Singapore 089114 | Monday to Saturday 1100-1900, Closed on Sundays | Tel: 9181 1451\n6. Fu Shi Traditional Roasted\nAlready evident from the running lines formed at the stall, the char siew rice/ wanton noodle served at Fu Shi Traditional Roasted is absolutely brilliant. The slices of char siew are succulent, oozing with flavours and nicely-charred on the slightly reddish outer skin of the meat. The dark, honeyed sauce helps to tantalize your taste buds even further and does nothing but satisfy your every char-siew desire.\nFu Shi Traditional Roasted: 320 Shunfu Road, Shunfu Mart Food Centre, #02-25, Singapore 570320 | Wednesday to Sunday 0830-1330, Closed on Mondays & Tuesdays | Tel: 9237 8157\n5. Alex\u2019s Eating House\nAlex\u2019s Eating House Char siew rice ($4)\nNoted to be\u00a0one of the stalls in Singapore to serve the best HK-style roasted meats, Alex\u2019s Eating House definitely does not disappoint when it comes to serving quality char siew rice. The char siew sold here has the perfect combination of fatty and meaty and the only problem is that they are sold out rather quickly. One can order a bowl of lotus soup for a mere $1.50 which is fantastic for the steamy, slightly salty herbal soup helps to cleanse your palate after a hearty meal of tender meats and heavy sauces.\nAlex\u2019s Eating House: 87 Beach Road #01-01, Chye Sing Building, Singapore 189695 | Monday to Sunday\u00a00900-1800\n4. Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint\nKay Lee Char Siew rice with Sio Bak ($5)\nHaving heard of this famed Char siew joint and learning from a friend that someone once paid a million dollars to buy Kay Lee\u2019s\u00a0char siew recipe over, I made it a personal quest to hunt this eatery out.\u00a0I found the char siew at Kay Lee\u2019s to be unique in the way that they do not add unnatural colouring to their char siew meats, hence the blackened outer skin of the meat. The char siew, which was chopped in thick slices, was flavourful and had a lovely charred taste that was not overbearing in any way.\nWe ordered a mug of Kay Lee\u2019s Ice Lemon Tea for we were told it was one of their signature drinks. It was definitely not a regrettable decision for downing the refreshing, sweet and tangy drink after our rather hearty char siew meal made was very lovely.\nKay Lee Roast Meat Joint: 125 Upper Paya Lebar Road, Singapore 534838 | Monday to Sunday 1030-2000 | Tel: 6743 8778\n3. Uncle Louis Hainanese Chicken Rice\nUncle Louis Char Siew Rice with Sio bak ($3.50)\nI\u2019ve fallen into the habit of ordering my Char Siew Rice with Roasted Pork\u00a0($3.50) which is always a good idea when ordering from Uncle Louis Hainanese Chicken Rice. Apart from the succulent and drenched-in-sauce char siew, the roasted pork\u2019s crispy crackling skin pairs very nicely with the more tender pieces of char siew.\nAnother thing I adore about the char siew dish served at Uncle Louis is that it comes with a nice steamy bowl of Chicken & Cabbage soup. Savoury and not too oily, the soup makes for a perfect accompanying dish with the Char siew rice.\nUncle Louis Hainanese Chicken Rice: Multi Storey Car Park, 19A Dover Crescent, Singapore 131019 | Monday to Sunday 0800-1730\n2.\u00a0Lau Phua Chay Authentic Roasted\u00a0Delicacies\nLau Phua Chay Char siew and Roasted duck rice ($5)\nWhile the glob of dark sauce coated over the char siew served at Lua Phua Chay may seem intimidating at first sight, one should not fret. In spite of\u00a0the murderous-looking sauce, the flavours of the entire dish turned gory into glory for the sweet, tender char siew, paired with the savoury sauce and the fragrant rice made for one of the best char siew dishes I\u2019ve ever had. This stall is a definite must-try for all Char siew or roasted meat fanatics!\nLau Phua Chay Authentic Roasted Delicacies: Bukit Merah Lane 1, Singapore 150120 | Monday to Friday 1100-1900, Sunday 1100-1900, Closed on Sundays | Tel: 9663 6862\n1.Fatty Cheong (Bukit Merah)\nFatty Cheong Char Siew rice ($3.50)\nLocated a short walking distance away from Lau Phua Chay, Fatty Cheong (Bukit Merah) definitely lived up to its name and reputation. While I was slightly disappointed that I had gotten there a little too late and they ran out of Roasted Pork, all my worries were forgotten when I dug into that purely Char Siew dish. The Char siew slices are fatty, moist and the sauce syrupy\u00a0but not cloying. Paired with the sambal chili, the twinge of spice gave the entire dish an extra kick of flavours that was simply fantastic.\nFatty Cheong (Bukit Merah): 6 Jalan Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-120, ABC Bricksworks Food Centre Singapore 150006 | Friday to Wednesday: 1100-2030, Closed on Thursdays | Tel: 9882 4949\nFatty Cheong (Toa Payoh)\nThe recipe of the fatty but absolutely delicious char siew, being the brainchild of Fatty Cheong himself, has been passed down to his son who now mans a stall in Toa Payoh, a good distance away from his parent. The char siew rice at Fatty Cheong 2.0 definitely still lives up to the original\u2019s standards, with its\nFatty Cheong (Toa Payoh): Food Alley @ Blk 190 Toa Payoh Lor 6, #01-518, Singapore 310190 | Monday to Sunday 1130-1900 | Tel: 9428 1983\nForming this list was difficult for the mere fact that many of the char siew stalls mentioned sell roasted meats of topnotch quality and it is hard to compare one to the other for each has its own unique style of cooking and whatnot. If any of these Char siew stalls happen to be situated near your workplace or someplace within your neighbourhood, I urge you, char siew-lover or not, to give it a try!\n* indicates required\nEmail Address *\nFirst Name\n$10 off promo code on dining vouchers\nGet $10 off over 600 dining vouchers from ChopeDeals when you subscribe to our free mailing list!\nName\nEmail\nRelated\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nAbout\nSETHLUI.COM is a Singapore Food, Travel, Nightlife online publication with more than 3 million page views each month.

            "20th September 2017\nFamous sio bak stalls for shiok roast meat\nWhen I order from a roast meat stall, my first choice is usually pork belly. Its mix of textures is delicious, with crunchy skin, soft fats, and tender meat. More than a few times, I\u2019ve discreetly pulled off the golden tops from my parents\u2019 share of roast pork so I could indulge in more. If you find yourself craving satisfying sio bak, here are 10 famous roast meat stalls to head down to.\n1. Foong Kee Roasted Meat\nFoong Kee\u2019s crunchy sio bak tastes salty as it melts in your mouth, and a portion of it with rice costs $3.50.

            "Serangoon Gardens has an outstanding reputation for being an enclave that houses everything and anything you could ever need. From ice cream and roti prata, to quaint cafes and craft beer bars and even KTVs\u2026 but there is one particular enclave within the neighbourhood that draws crowds from all over the island \u2013 Chomp Chomp Food Centre.\nThis hawker heaven is not one to discount on because it houses some of Singapore\u2019s most prized dishes. Offering a stunning array of local favourites\u00a0from char kway teow to barbecued seafood and satay, there is no surprise why it is always crowded.\nBut is Chomp Chomp really that fantastic, or is it just overrated? Read on to find out what we think.\nChomp Chomp is unlike many other hawker centres in that it only begins operating at 6pm,\u00a0which is good news for night owls who find their bellies rumbling late at night.\nNot to be associated with comfortable and cozy dining, Chomp Chomp is a place that usually sees massive dinner crowds and overworked hawkers. So expect to be squeezing your way in and out of crowds and long waits for food and vacant tables.\n#1 HOKKIEN MEE\nAh Hock Hokkien Mee (Stall 27) is a name synonymous with Chomp Chomp Food Centre. Ah Hock serves up a drier rendition of the classic Hokkien Prawn Noodles (S$3/$4/$5) which is regarded as one of the best in Singapore. An iconic local dish, we really loved the rich and aromatic seafood flavours and the bouncy noodles, complete with fresh ingredients.\n#2 BARBECUED SAMBAL STINGRAY\nWe ordered up a small portion of sambal stingray (S$15) from stall 6 and 7 and to our pleasant surprise, it was not small at all. The chewy, stringy stingray meat was well-marinated and covered in a generous heap of savory sambal sauce. It was not overly spicy but we felt that it would have been better enjoyed with a plate of rice to neutralize the strong sambal flavour.\n#3 BLACK CARROT CAKE\nThe black carrot cake (S$3) from stall 36 is a must-try for lovers of this popular breakfast item. Props to the cook for being generous with the egg and sweet dark sauce. The carrot cake was well flavoured with a copious amount of garlic to amp up the flavour but what made this so unforgettable was the perfectly\u00a0charred exterior of the carrot cake coupled with the sweet sauce; it almost tasted like caramel.\n#4 CHAR KWAY TEOW\nNo dinner at Chomp Chomp is complete without a freshly fried plate of char\u00a0kway teow, and the stall to look out for is Chomp Chomp Fried Kway Teow Mee from stall 35. It may not be the best in Singapore, but it sure lived up to our expectations.\u00a0It contained everything you could ever want out of a good char kway teow: sweet, savory, generous portions of ingredients and a perfect balance of both mee and kway teow.\n#5 SUGAR CANE JUICE\nWith a feast like this, you\u2019re going to want something sweet and refreshing to wash everything down.\u00a0After all, there\u2019s no better way to end a Singaporean hawker feast than with pints of ice-cold sweet sugarcane juice from Charlie Corner (stall 14). With all that chili and barbecued delights that you will be indulging in here,\u00a0you will surely require jug-loads of it.\nMassive glasses like the ones we had cost us only S$2 each!\n#6 BARBECUED CHICKEN WINGS\nAs you snake your way through the crowds, one thing you are sure to notice on every table is the immense amount of chicken bones piled high.\nChong Pang (Stall 28) is everybody\u2019s go-to for barbecued chicken wings (S$1.40 each) because of their addictive\u00a0chili sauce that is sweet and spicy that you can further pimp with a squeeze of fresh\u00a0calamansi. The wings themselves are served fresh from the fire, with skin that is crispy and mildly charred and meat that is bursting with the slightly sweet marinade.\n#7 PORK AND CHICKEN SATAY\nAt Chong Pang (Stall 28), you can also enjoy a variety of meat satays in addition to their amazing chicken wings. For a hit of variety, we decided to try both the chicken and pork satays (S$0.70 per stick).\nBetween the two meat satays, we felt that the chicken was the star. It was tender and had a perfect char to it. Also, we liked that it slid off the stick much easier as compared to the pork satay. The Ketupat (S$0.70) was not the tastiest we have had but it did a good job in polishing up the rest of the satay gravy.\n#8 OYSTER OMELETTE\nOyster lovers are in for a treat with the Singapore-style fried oyster omelette that is available at Ang Sa Li (Stall 33).\u00a0Quit the calorie counting and order up a plate of this eggy, starchy dish dotted with plump, briny oysters.\nWhat made this dish stand out was the freshness of the oysters, the firmness of the omelette, and the fact that unlike many other places, they did not go too heavy on the amount of starch. The \u2018chinchalok\u2019 sauce that accompanied this brilliant omelette was tangy and spicy which really cut through the distinct seawater flavour of the oyster. A portion this size only set us back S$5 which was super worth it.\nAll in all, our evening at Chomp Chomp Food Centre was truly an evening well spent (as with many other evenings we\u2019ve had because we practically grew up eating at Chomp Chomp). Each individual food item surpassed our expectations and albeit the food centre being incredibly hot and stuffy, the food alone blew us away. Outstanding or overrated?\nDefinitely outstanding.\nA D D  C O M M E N T\nTop Stories\n"

            "The Best Chicken Wings in Singapore\nI recently read a survey which found that 98% of ardent chicken-lovers regard the wings as some of the best parts of the bird. I count myself to be amongst this 98%.\nFrom sauce-slathered bar bites, to charred outside nibbles at barbecues and hawker centre har cheong gai, chicken wings have a special place in Singapore\u2019s food culture.\nThat said, chicken wings are not exactly the healthiest food around. To keep everyone\u2019s weight in-check, I decided to be the sacrificial lamb and spent three full consecutive days eating chicken wings from across the island.\nThe results? An outbreak of pimples, an expanded waistline and this list of the 20 best chicken wings in Singapore worth spending your calories on.\n1. Lola\u2019s Cafe\nDrizzled with sweet honey and sprinkled with paprika flakes, the chicken wings from Lola\u2019s Cafe are a nice change from the usual wings that are merely served with chilli sauce or ketchup. The wings and drumlets play host to a slew of spices without overpowering the natural flavour of the chicken, and I found myself scraping off the honey on the plate with a piece of the drumlet.\nI was slightly puzzled that most patrons there are sharing the wings, because frankly I would have had the whole plate to myself.\nAddress: 5 Simon Rd, Singapore 545893.\n2. Little Part One Cafe\nLittle Part One Cafe is a small cozy cafe that epitomises tranquillity. At first glance, the buffalo wings looked rather unappetizing as the skin was an unappealing shade of dark brown. But they made up for it in the taste department. Borrowing the sweetness from the Thai chilli sauce that was served alongside, these wings were flavourful with the right amount of spice.\nMark my words: I\u2019ll be back to try the Smelly Cheese Buffalo Wings and Mint Miley Buffalo Wings.\nAddress: 15 Jasmine Road\u00a0Singapore 576584.\n3. Wings World\nIt is no secret that some of the best eateries in Singapore are congregated in the East Coast area of Singapore. Wings World, a casual restaurant that opened last year adds to that list. Here, it\u2019s all about choice. Exercise yours wisely. You can order your wings with a wide array of homemade sauces.\nOn top of classic buffalo wings that comes in four levels of spiciness, Wings World offers other more interesting sauces and seasonings such as Vurry Curry, Mango Habanero and Jamaican Jerk.\nOf all the flavours, Mango Habanero was the standout, with a fruity sweetness that lingered without being overpowering because of the chilli pepper spiciness that cuts across. Though I wished for bigger and fatter wings, I\u2019d definitely be back to have more of these wings along with some cheap beer. All wings are also served with celery, carrot and their much-raved homemade blue cheese dip.\nAddress: 214 East Coast Road, Singapore 428913.\n4. Yan Fried Bee Hoon \u7131\nThis stall has gained much traction on social media after someone uploaded a photo of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong queueing for it.\nI could finally see why PM Lee spent a good 30 minutes queueing for these chicken wings. The chicken wings, with their crunchy skins laced with a mild prawn paste flavour, and runny-moist flesh on the inside had me sucking the bones dry, down to their very tips. Paired with the spicy-sweet chili sauce, the combination is perfect.\nThe customer right before me ordered 50 chicken wings, and I saw how the owner took great pains to neatly arrange the wings into the packet, demonstrating the sheer amount of pride he has in his work.\nThere is a perpetual queue at this stall no matter what time of the day you choose to visit and it\u2019s not hard to see why. The prices are also almost unheard of in Singapore: $1.20 for each chicken wing and $0.60 for bee hoon.\nAddress: Redhill Lane Blk 85, Redhill Food Centre #01-09, Singapore\u00a0150085.\n5. Eng Kee\nHe did not ask me how my day was, or where I wanted to go. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell? You are making me hungry!\u201d was the first thing the taxi driver told me when I entered the cab with five Eng Kee chicken wings placed in a brown paper bag.\nI felt slightly guilty for filling his cab with the aroma of the Eng Kee chicken wings because I couldn\u2019t help but take some away from trying some freshly fried ones at the stall. In terms of taste, price and quality of the chicken wings, the ones from Eng Kee are largely similar to the ones from Yan Fried Bee Hoon, but the waiting time at Eng Kee is way shorter.\nWhile the chicken wing may look unassuming at first glance, I was sold at the very first bite. This was definitely the best $1.20 I had spent in a long while.\nAddress: 117 Commonwealth Drive #01-711, Singapore\u00a0140117.\n6. Cuscaden Patio\nI have a friend who has been going on and on about how Cuscaden Patio has the best fried chicken wings in Singapore so I was eager to finally try them. Located at the basement of Ming Arcade, the smell of deep fried chicken was already wafting through the air when I arrived, and every group had at least a plate of chicken wings on their table.\nAt first glance, the chicken wings looked a tad over-fried and not golden brown like how I expected them to be. As I dipped the wing into the homemade chilli sauce and bit into the succulent flesh of the chicken wing, I was a convert.\nAt just $10+ for half a dozen of chicken wings, these chicken wings are definitely a steal for a pub in town. With a chicken wing in a hand and a bottle of beer in another, my night was complete.\nAddress: 21 Cuscaden Road, #B1-11 Ming Arcade, Singapore 249720.\n7. Two Wings\nLegend has it that Jeremy, the stall owner of Two Wings, spent six months learning the secret family recipe from the same granduncle who taught the owners of Carona Chicken and Victor Fried Chicken Rice.\nThe first thing that impressed me was the lack of grease on the outer layer of the skin. It immediately made these wings feel less sinful, and one does not having to worry about clogging a vessel while enjoying the meal. The chicken wings are cooked to a rich golden brown crisp, with the meat within retaining just the right amount of moist and juice.\nDipped into a homemade garlic chilli sauce that gave the wings a nice bit of zest, I would gladly trade my IKEA chicken wing fanaticism for these.Appropriately named Two Wings, I could see why no one could stop at just one wing.\nAddress: Blk 119 Bukit Merah Lane 1, #01-40, Singapore 151119.\n8. The Bark Cafe\nLocated at the extreme end of Singapore, The Bark Cafe provides an entirely alfresco dining experience (read: no air-conditioning, but shelter and fans provided). This caf\u00e9-restaurant beside the Changi Chapel and Museum has a calm, relaxed ambiance and is a good switch from the usual hustle and bustle of the city.\nThe chicken wings here have received the stamp of approval from celebrity chef, Eric Neo, who claimed that these are one of the best wings he had. Perhaps it\u2019s because I had such high expectations of the wings here, I thought the wings here were merely slightly above average.\nWhat came as a slight disappointment to me was that the quality of these wings were fairly inconsistent. One of the three wings I consumed was slightly undercooked and not piping hot like the other two that were served. Nevertheless, this is a great place to be for a quaint, quiet afternoon.\nAddress: 1000 Upper Changi Rd N, 507707.\n9. No. 5 Emerald Hill\nHoused in a 1910 Peranakan shophouse, this cozy 2-storey bar with antique carvings and unpolished wooden flooring is an extremely popular after-work hang-out location among both expats and locals.\nNo. 5 Emerald Hill serves wings that will make the KFC Colonel cry with envy. The chicken wings are marinated in shrimp sauce and Chinese wine, and are the perfect finger food to wash down with a pint of beer and one of their classic martinis. It takes self-discipline not to polish off the whole basket of wings within minutes.\nWith a crispy chicken wing in a hand and a beer in another, there are few places I\u2019d rather be on a Friday night.\nAddress: 5 Emerald Hill Road, Singapore\u00a0229289.\n10. Holland Village XO Fish Head Bee Hoon\nThis is an extremely popular fish bee hoon stall among Singaporeans, and the fish soup here is one of my personal favourites, but that is an article for another day. The lesser-known fact about this place is that they serve up really good prawn paste chicken (or otherwise known as \u2018har cheong gai\u2019) as well.\nIt\u2019s always freshly fried, and with the right amount of crisp on the outside, while being juicy and fragrant on the inside. The use of premium prawn paste with fresh, rather than frozen, chicken wings makes a huge difference to the taste.\nI have no complaints about this place except for the slightly erratic Uncle who tends to be a little angsty sometimes. Still, I\u2019m willing to put up with his cranky attitude because of the amazing quality of his food.\nAddress: 19A Dover Crescent #01-05, Singapore 131019.\n11. Beer Market\nBetcha didn\u2019t know huh? Yes, your trusty Beer Market packs so much more than just a good live band and beer. While they have lots of excellent bar grub to choose from, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t skip the honey glazed BBQ chicken wings. The sweetness of the honey nicely compliments the natural flavour of the poultry, making these wings surprisingly addictive.\nOnce, I had 14 honey glazed BBQ chicken wings in a single night and woke up with a voice so coarse that my parents could not recognize it. I had no regrets.\nAddress: 3B River Valley Road, #01-17/02-02 Clarke Quay, Singapore 179021.\n12. Kko Kko Na Ra\nThis list wouldn\u2019t be complete without a Korean Fried Chicken brand and Kko Kko Na Ra is a significant step above the \u201cfast food\u201d Korean fried chicken chains of 4 Fingers and Bon Chon. One of the very first restaurants in Singapore to serve Korean Fried Chicken, they have been maintaining their high quality ever since they opened in 2008.\nBy double frying and removing the fat from the skin, the Koreans have developed a crunchy, non-greasy deep fried chicken, mostly dipped in sauces. The chicken here is considerably a lot thicker and fleshier, but pricer as well.\nOpt for the Chicken Combo Set I say, that comes with three flavours: sweet and spicy, soy garlic, and original. The best part of Kko Kko Na Ra is that it opens past midnight. I can\u2019t say no to having fried chicken for supper.\nAddress: 57 Tras Street, Singapore 078996.\n13. Tony Cafe\nOne of my personal life goals is uncovering cheap and good food in Singapore, and I consider Tony Cafe one of my achievements. The Adelphi is a sleepy mall that sees more shopkeepers than customers, except during lunch hour when hordes of office workers head over to Tony Cafe.\nTony Cafe is an economical rice stall that sells affordable home-cooked food. But its best-kept secret is the Fried Chicken Rice Set that is only served on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. While the batter is slightly bland, the marination sits thoroughly on the meat and is flavourful even to its bones.\nAddress: 1 Coleman Street, The Adelphi, #02-23, Singapore 179803.\n14. Punggol Nasi Lemak\nI actually have a WhatsApp group chat that\u2019s titled \u201cPunggol Nasi Lemak\u201d with some food emoji because this is a frequent supper spot for my friends and I.\nWhile I have heard mix reviews about the Nasi Lemak here, the fried chicken wings here are indisputably delicious. The wings are nicely battered and marinated so well that one is immediately rewarded with a crunchy, juicy bite filled with that elusive flavour from the perfectly fried chicken wings and drumstick.\nThere is no greater gratification than completely stripping the flesh and skin off the bones of the chicken wing and drumstick here.\nAddress: 238 Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore\u00a0437026.\n15. Wingstop\nI had my first taste of Wingstop last year. A lady working out at Wingstop was providing samples to visitors at Bedok Mall and I thought to myself \u201canother fast food chain selling fried chicken in Singapore?\u201d Despite my initial skepticism, I ended up eating my words because after consuming a full meal of chicken wings and fries, I was relatively impressed.\nI\u2019m an avid cheese lover and Garlic Parmesan is without a doubt, my favourite out of all the flavours I tried. Parmesan cheese is generously sprinkled on every chicken wing, and each cheesy bite has a hint of garlic to go with it. Other flavour I enjoyed are Louisiana Rub, Lemon Pepper and Teriyaki.\nWingstop also offers boneless wings for those who may prefer fuss-free consumption though to me, part of the joy of eating chicken wings comes from biting every little tiny bit of succulent flesh from its bones.\nAddress: Bedok Mall #B1-53, Singapore\u00a0467360.\n16. Chuckwagon BBQ & Grill\nOriginally featured in our places to go on a road trip in Singapore , I like Chuckwagon for its secluded location, western cowboy decoration and friendly service staff. But it was its unforgiving, fiery buffalo wings that really got my attention \u2014 crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, covered in a sticky red glaze that I found hard to resist.\nThe buffalo wings here come in ten levels of spiciness. Level Two was just right for me and I couldn\u2019t consume Level Three without gulping down some water.\nAddress: 7 Portsdown Road, Singapore 139298.\n17. Teddy Bear BBQ Chicken Wing\nOne of the things that used to frustrate me when I visit East Coast Lagoon Food Centre was the fact that I never really knew which stall is the best, and I usually end up ordering randomly from whoever does the best touting that night.\nAfter several visits and recommendations from my friends, I have safely concluded that Teddy Bear BBQ Chicken Wing does the best job when it comes to chicken wings at this competitive cluster. The skin is perfectly crisp and the tender meat is dripping with juice.\nFusing the flavours of the sea with that of poultry in the best way possible, Teddy Bear\u2019s expert hands are more than worthy of a spot on this list.\nAddress: #01-44, East Coast Lagoon Food Village, 1220 East Coast Parkway, Singapore 468960.\n18. Bedok North BBQ Chicken Wings\nI don\u2019t think I ever visited Bedok 85 without ordering the BBQ grilled chicken wings over there.\nThe BBQ Grilled Chicken Wings here are superbly executed. Crispy and charred bits of glistening skin on the outside while incredibly juicy and tender on the inside. They are well-marinated, and very flavourful both on the outside and inside. The bright heat of the tangy chili sauce and a squirt of lime highlights the flavor and made these wings even more addictive. This is the perfect side dish to go along with your favourite bak chor mee.\nA word of caution: expect to wait at least 20 minutes for these wings during peak hours.\nAddress: 85 Fengshan Centre, Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 #01-53 Singapore 460085.\n19. Hooters\nSource: DeePasion\nDon\u2019t be distracted by the skimpily dressed waitresses at Hooters, their world famous chicken wings are the real catch over here.\nThe skin was crackly and crunchy, good enough that I found myself scrabbling after the bits and pieces of shrapnel that fell away. The wings were well-seasoned and have a genuinely spicy kick, lifting the flavours for a common finger snack. With five secret sauces to choose from, Hooters is definitely worth a revisit.\nAddress: Blk 3D, River Valley Road, Clarke Quay #01-03 Shophouse Row, Singapore 179023.\n20. Wings Bar\nWatch out, Hooters \u2013 you\u2019ve got competition.\nWings Bar, a 1940s World War II aviation themed watering hole complete with hunks and babes in flight suits and short skirts, serves up buffalo wings done in many ways. The wings on their signage do not refer to the chicken wings but the overall aviation theme.\nNevertheless, they serve up pretty interesting chicken wings. Choose from ten different Buffalo wing flavours, including the original B52s, the Thai afterburner and Japanese zero teriyaki selection. For something completely different try the house nachos served with layered cheese and sour cream, and topped with spicy beef for an extra kick.\nAddress: 3D River Valley Rd, Singapore 179023.\nThe Grande Dame of comfort food\nA good wing needs only three things \u2013 to have come from a quality bird, to have the right texture and to be smothered in a sauce that is delicious but not so in-your-face that you can\u2019t taste the chicken. Sounds simple, right? But the simple things are often the hardest to get right. Still, these 20 eateries have nailed it.\nMy personal favourites are Eng Kee, Yan Fried Bee Hoon, Beer Market, Lola\u2019s Cafe and Wingstop.\nAs a kid, I have bugged my parents on multiple occasions to buy me my favourite chicken wings. Chicken wings have accompanied me through multiple ups and downs in my life \u2013 the memorable house parties, the family gatherings and the time I failed my exams. Chicken wings are truly the Grande Dame of comfort food, and will continue to be for a long time.\nFor the love of food\nWe would like to thank our sponsor Pickat for making this post possible.

            "Menu Close\nGeneric selectors\n9 places for the best chicken wings in Singapore\nWhether you are craving for American-style wings that are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside or flavourful ones that are glazed with Korean sweet and spicy sauce, these places are the ones to visit for the most scrumptious chicken wings.\nby Rebecca Seah / January 24, 2017\nLola\u2019s Caf\u00e9\nJan 22, 2017 at 1:27am PST\nLola\u2019s Caf\u00e9 would be a name more than familiar to caf\u00e9-hoppers in Singapore. Having been in the scene for much longer than the newer establishments, the caf\u00e9 is famous for their delicious grub, and in particular their legendary Honey Paprika Wings.\nEven before you eat the wings, the intoxicating fragrance of deep-fried goodness is bound to leave you salivating. The crispy outer layer which is seasoned with honey and the paprika powder packs a punch with its sweet and smoky flavours, and the meat inside is juicy and tender. These are the wings that bring in the customers by the horde during the weekends, and we totally see why.\nPrice of wings: $10.50\nChomp Pang Huat\nJan 4, 2017 at 3:44am PST\nMany Singaporeans have memories of dinners at hawker centres with a huge spread of local dishes, and chicken wings are, most likely, part of the ensemble. One of the most popular chains of chicken wing hawker stalls would undoubtedly be Chomp Pang Huat.\nTheir stall at Chomp Chomp serves a mean chicken wing, whetting your appetite right upon the sight of caramel brown wings. Squeeze some lime juice on the wings, sink right in and you are immediately brought to chicken wing heaven with the sublime flavours of light saltiness and a tinge of tanginess from the lime.\nPrice of wings: $1.30 per piece, minimum order 2 pieces\nAddress: 20 Kensington Park Road, Chomp Chomp Food Centre, #01-26, Singapore 557269\nWingstop\nAug 19, 2016 at 4:09am PDT\nThose of us who watch our fair share of American entertainment would have heard of Buffalo Wings \u2013 a type of wings known for its sweet and spicy combo.\nWonder\u00a0how this delicacy tastes like? Wonder no more, as Wingstop brings to you their amazing their buffalo wings. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, try out their Asian twists of the Buffalo wings with Teriyaki and Oriental Soy Pepper. Muslim friends rejoice, as they are halal certified.\nPrice of wings: $9.77 (8 pieces classic wings)\nAddress: City Square Mall (180 Kitchener Rd, #B1-33/34/K15, Singapore 208539) and Bedok Mall (311 New Upper Changi Rd, #B1-53 , Singapore 467360)\nTimbre @ The Substation\nNov 5, 2016 at 8:30am PDT\nWings are hands down the best type of food to go with beer, and Timbre is very possibly the place where you\u2019ll find the best of both worlds. Complement your delicious deep fried wings seasoned in Timbre\u2019s secret recipe with a mug (or maybe more) of their refreshing handcrafted beers, accompanied by good music and better company. They always say that food tastes better when the ambiance is there, and Timbre with its live music and bustling vibes proves that true.\nPrice of wings: $14\nPunggol Nasi Lemak\nJan 14, 2017 at 11:55pm PST\nPunggol Nasi Lemak has achieved a cult status among foodies in Singapore, garnering snaking queues at all hours of the day. We suspect that its popularity has more than just a little to do with its absolutely magnificent fried chicken wings.\nThe wings are so big that if you put a chicken wing on top of your rice, you barely see the rice underneath anymore. Because the turnover rate of their food is so high, you will never get a stale chicken wing. The satisfaction of tearing into that succulent meat is amazing, and you will be a fan once you try it.\nPrice: $1.50 per wing\nYan Fried Bee Hoon\nSep 9, 2016 at 1:01am PDT\nTo eat what is probably the only chicken wings that our very own PM Lee Hsien Loong queued up for, head down to Yan Fried Bee Hoon to try their famous hawker delicacy. For those of you who are about the dismiss this as being overly hyped-over, give it a try and you will see why.\nThese golden wings are coated in a crispy layer of prawn paste sauce which gives way into dense, juicy flesh inside. Top up your wing experience by eating it with their fried bee hoon which only costs $0.60! Where do you even find such affordable food anymore in Singapore?\nPrice: $1.20 per wing\nAddress: Redhill Lane Blk 85, Redhill Food Centre #01-09, Singapore 150085.\nCuscaden Patio\nMay 2, 2015 at 8:19am PDT\nFor a chicken wing that packs a good surprise in your first bite, check out Cuscaden Patio and their rave-worthy chicken wings. At first sight, the darker colours of the chicken wings might not look the most appealing, but with one bite and your mind will simply be blown by how good it tastes despite its less pretty appearance.\nEnjoy your wings with a nice cool mug of beer as you chill in the pub\u2019s laidback atmosphere.\nPrice: $10.00++ for 6 wings\nAddress: 21 Cuscaden Road, #B1-11 Ming Arcade, Singapore 249720.\nKko Kko Na Ra\nWe must thank Korea for the many delicious foods it has introduced to the world, and how could we possibly leave out Korean fried chicken?! K-pop lovers and K-drama fans must have encountered at least one Korean drama episode where the characters sit around a box of Korean fried chicken and just immerse in its sweet-spicy goodness.\nKko Kko Na Ra stands out from other fast food chains for its focus on quality, and you can certainly taste it in the crunchy, non-greasy fried chicken that is drenched in their very very yummy thick sauce.\nPrice: $20 for small chicken combo set (3 pieces)\nAddress: 57 Tras Street, Singapore 078996.\nHooters\nJan 12, 2017 at 6:29am PST\nBesides the immediate pull factor of the sexy waitresses that Hooters is famous for, their wings alone are reason enough to visit. The outer coating of Hooters\u2019 wings are so delicate and crusty that as you bite into the wing bits of the outer layer disintegrate, and the crisp is so well seasoned that you would be compelled to pick up the pieces that have fallen off onto your plate and eat them all up.\nPrice: $9.09 for 10 pieces\nAddress: Blk 3D, River Valley Road, Clarke Quay #01-03 Shophouse Row, Singapore 179023.\nThis article first appeared here .

            "30 Best Midnight Supper Spots in Singapore For Hungry Insomniacs\nLast Updated: March 24, 2020\nShares\nBeing a nation of foodies, we do have an endless list of places to go to. It\u2019s not gluttony but we do eat a lot. At work, in school, along the street, you will always see someone with some form of food in their hand.\nSo with an endless list of eateries, you think you are all set but what happens when you have a craving for\u00a0food at 2am? Will it be McDelivery or instant noodles? Never fear. With this list of ultimate late midnight supper spots, your growling stomachs will not bother the neighbours after 12am.\nHere\u2019s my list of the places you should go for supper around the island.\n1. Rochor Original Beancurd\nPerhaps this is Singapore\u2019s most famous\u00a0tau huay, known for silky smooth\u00a0beancurd. Next door neighbour and rival, Beancurd City, also serves equally good beancurd.\u00a0Both owners are brothers after all, just not on speaking terms. Rochor Original Beancurd also has egg tarts which makes a nice accompaniment to soybean milk and tau huay.\nAddress: 2 Short Street, Singapore\u00a0188211 | Tel: +65 6334 1138\nOpening\u00a0hours:\u00a0Sunday \u2013 Thursday 11am \u2013 1am, Friday \u2013 Saturday, 11am \u2013 3am\n2. Cafeela\nAsk any Singaporean what Jalan Kayu is famous for and you are likely to hear \u201cJalan Kayu Roti Prata\u201d. Jalan Kayu has Thasevi and Cafeela which has its fans alike. Cafeela has the upper hand with it being situated next to the public carpark. Do try the Nasi Briyani and Roti John, one of better ones around. Thasevi is otherwise a bit more pricey, but nonetheless still good.\nAddress: 254 Jalan Kayu, Singapore 799481 | Tel: +65 6483 5477\nOpening\u00a0hours: 24 Hours\n3. Feng Shan Food Centre/Bedok 85 Market\nFeng Shan Food Centre aka Bedok Block 85\u00a0is known for its atmosphere of buzz and good grub among the east-siders. Must eats at Block 85 are the\u00a0soup based Bak Chor Mee (Ah Poh Minced Meat Noodle, Xing Ji Rou Cuo Mian,\u00a0Seng Hiang Bak Chor Mee), Sambal Stingray (Chan BBQ), Hokkien Prawn Mee, Satay, Chicken Wings, and Oyster Egg.\nAh Poh Minced Meat Noodle: Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 #01-18, Singapore\u00a0460085\nOpening Hours: Tuesday \u2013 Saturday 6pm \u2013\u00a03am, Sunday 6pm \u2013 12 am, Closed on Monday\nBedok North 85 Fried Oyster:\u00a0\u00a0Blk 85 Bedok North Street 4 #01-09/10, Singapore\u00a0460085\nOpening\u00a0Hours: 4pm \u2013 2am Daily\nThe world\u2019s cheapest one Michelin Star restaurant has a couple of outlets in Singapore. The latest one at Aperia in Kallang even opens till 3am on some days. So if you dread queuing during the waking hours of normal people, this is your best bet. Don\u2019t expect it to be of similar standards to the original Hong Kong outlet though.\nOpening hours: Sunday \u2013 Thursday 9am \u2013 11pm, Friday \u2013 Saturday 9am \u2013 3am\n5. Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak\nFor the eastsiders, there\u2019s the trio of nasi lemak stalls at Changi Village. For the westsiders, there\u2019s the one and only Boon Lay POWER Nasi Lemak. A very satisfying plate of nasi lemak, be prepared to queue when you go supper hunting for this stall.\nAddress: Blk 221B Boon Lay Place, #01-106, Singapore 642221 | Tel: +65 6266 4466 | Website\nOpening\u00a0hours: Tuesday \u2013 Sunday 6.30am to\u00a03.30am, Monday 4.30pm \u2013 3.30am\n6. Outram Park Ya Hua Rou Gu Cha\nOne of my favourite places for Bak Kut Teh, the\u00a0pigs trotters have lots of yummy fat collagen and the braised intestines are pretty soft. The pork soup has a very unique peppery taste that makes you want more after downing the first bak kut teh. Detractors will beg to differ but it\u2019s a pretty decent place if you are looking for Bak Kut Teh after most of the other stalls shutter for the night. There is ample parking and space as well, so no queuing needed.\nAddress: 7 Keppel Road, 01-05/07, PSA Tanjong Pagar Complex, Singapore 089053 | Tel: +65 6222 9610\nOpening hours:\u00a0Tuesday \u2013 Saturday 7am to 3pm and 6pm \u2013 4am, Sunday 7am\u00a0\u2013 3pm and 6pm \u2013 12am (Closed on Monday)\n7.\u00a0Fong Seng Fast Food Nasi Lemak\nAddress: 22 Clementi Rd,\u00a0Singapore 129757 | Tel: +65 6774 1429\nOpening\u00a0hours: 6am to 4am Daily\n8.\u00a0Spruce At Fire Station, Upper Bukit Timah\nIf you are looking for something heartier for a late night meal, check out Spruce.\u00a0Late night supper is served from 10pm to 11.45pm.\nAddress: 260 Upper Bukit Timah Road, #01-01, Singapore 588213 \u00a0| Website\nOpening\u00a0Hours:\u00a0Monday \u2013 Wednesday 5.30pm \u2013 1am, Thursday \u2013 Friday 11.30 am \u2013 1 am, Saturday \u2013 Sunday 9am \u2013 1am\n9. Mr Prata\nIf Jalan Kayu is too inaccessible for you,\u00a0check out Mr Prata instead. They have 3 outlets \u2013 Bedok, Tampines, and Botanic Gardens. Try the Maggi Goreng Prata (Maggi Noodles in a Prata) \u2013 it\u2019s really good.\nAddress:\u00a026 Evans Road, #01-02, Singapore \u2013 259367 | Tel: +65 6235 6993 | Website\nOpening\u00a0hours: 24 hours Daily\nAddress: 126 Sims Ave, Singapore\u00a0387449 | Tel: +65 6746 4757\nOpening\u00a0hours: 24 hours Daily\n11. Ponggol Nasi Lemak\nPonggol in name but far from it, Ponggol Nasi Lemak has never been in Ponggol. Such an irony. One of the more popular Chinese-style nasi lemaks, you can pretty much customize you own meal. Just be prepared to empty the wallet as prices are much higher compared to alternatives such as Chong Pang Nasi Lemak, which is also not too bad a spot for late night nasi lemak.\nAddress: 965 Upper Serangoon Road, Singapore 534721 | Tel: +65 6281 0020\nOpening\u00a0hours: 5.30pm to 3am (Closed on Thursday)\nAddress: 2 Parkstone Rd, Singapore 437649\u00a0| Tel: +65 6287 0020\nOpening\u00a0hours: 5.30pm to 2.30am (Closed on Thurday)\nOpening\u00a0hours:\u00a011.30am \u2013 2.30pm and 6pm \u2013 6am (Closed on Tuesday)\n13. Ming\u00a0Fa Fishball\nAddress: 246B Upper Thomson Road Singapore\u00a0574370 | Tel: +65 6455 4890\nOpening\u00a0Hours: 9.30am \u2013 4.30am Daily\n14. Beauty in The Pot\nIf you\u2019re up late at night craving for some warm soup, Beauty in The Pot would be a great fix. Open till 3am, foodies in the east can head over to OneKM Mall for\u00a0some night-time nourishment with their collagen-based broths.\nEven the ingredients are assured to be of high quality and are mostly handmade from scratch. The dining experience will be top-notch too as each table is served attentively by their experienced in-house hotpot masters.\nAddress:11 Tanjong Katong Road,\u00a0#02-21 OneKM, Singapore 437157 | Tel: +65 6702 2542 | Website\nOpening\u00a0hours: Monday \u2013\u00a0Thursday\u00a011am-3.30pm and 5.30pm-1am, Friday \u2013 Sunday 11am \u2013 3am\n15.\u00a0Chomp Chomp Food Centre\nDo you love crowded places? Natural smokey scents? Limited seating? Then Chomp Chomp is just the place for you. Eating here is indeed an experience.\u00a0For fans, this is arguably the best place on the island for sambal stingray, satay, oyster egg, chicken wings and hokkien mee. For others, this is overhyped and\u00a0just makes your hair smell like BBQ.\u00a0What\u2019s your take?\nCarrot Cake \u83dc\u982d\u7cbf (that\u2019s the literal name of the store):\u00a020 Kensington Park Road, Chomp Chomp Food Centre,\u00a0Singapore\u00a0557269\nOpening\u00a0hours: 2pm \u2013 12.30am (closed on alternate Tuesday)\nAng Sa Lee Oyster Omelette:\u00a020 Kensington Park Road, Chomp Chomp,\u00a0Singapore 557269\nOpening hours: 2pm \u2013 12.30am (closed on alternate Wednesday)\nChomp Chomp Hai Wei Yuan Seafood Barbecue:\u00a020 Kensington Park Road, Chomp Chomp,\u00a0Singapore 557269\nOpening hours: 2pm \u2013 12.30am\n16. Upper Bukit Timah (Cheong Chin Nam Shophouse Row)\nWith the new\u00a0Beauty World\u00a0MRT Station (DT5) up and running, this stretch of shophouses have been seeing an increase in patrons once again. Indian food from Al-Azhar or Al-Ameen (the former is better), frog porridge from G7 Sin Ma or freshly grilled burgers from Tenderfresh Classic are all good choices.\nAl-Ameen:\u00a04 Cheong Chin Nam Road, Singapore 599729 | Tel: +65 6465 1000\nOpening\u00a0hours:\u00a011am \u2013 3am\u00a0(Daily)\nG7 Sin Ma:\u00a05 Cheong Chin Nam Road, Singapore 599730 | Tel: +65 6467 7317\nOpening\u00a0hours: 12pm to 3am (Daily)\nTenderfresh Classic:\u00a09 Cheong Chin Nam Road,\u00a0Singapore 599734 | Tel: +65 6762 2661\nOpening\u00a0hours:\u00a0Sunday \u2013 Thursday 11.30am \u2013 11.30pm,\u00a0Friday\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Saturday 11:30am \u2013 12.45am\nAl-Azhar: 11 Cheong Chin Nam Road, Singapore 599736 | Tel: +65 6466 5052\nOpening\u00a0hours: 24 hours (Daily)\n17. Heng Long Teochew Porridge\u00a0\u5174\u9686\u6f6e\u6d32\u7ca5\nLocated along the popular midnight eateries of Upper Serangoon Road, Heng Long has seen an increase in queues for its popular midnight Teo Chew Porridge, as well as an increase in price. One of my favorite hot spots for supper since I stay nearby, they have quite a large variety of comforting dishes to choose from.\nThe spicy minced pork, braised duck, fish cake and cabbage (\u9ad8\u9e97\u83dc) are some of my standard accompanying\u00a0orders, along with a bowl of braised sauce (\u5364\u6c41). If the queue is too long, there is another porridge stall called Ah Li San right beside\u00a0Heng Long\u00a0as well which also serves as good a Teochew porridge.\nAddress:\u00a01006, Upper Serangoon Road, Singapore 534744\nOpening\u00a0Hours:\u00a010am \u2013 4am Daily\nOpening\u00a0Hours: Monday \u2013 Thursday 5.30pm \u2013 2am, Friday \u2013 Saturday 5.30pm \u2013 3am, Sunday 5.30pm\u00a0 \u2013 12am\nAddress: 532 Upper Serangoon Road,\u00a0Singapore 534547 | Tel: +65 8838 3532\nOpening\u00a0hours:\u00a06pm- 2.30am Daily (Closed on Wednesday)\n20. Ma La Hui Cui Guan\u00a0\u9ebb\u8fa3\u835f\u8403\u9986\nWant to have\u00a0extremely spicy sze-chuan peppers at 3am in the morning? What could possibly go wrong? Ma La Hui Cui Guan offers a la carte as well as a buffet menu\u00a0for their Ma La hot pot, guaranteed to numb\u00a0your taste buds. When I had it, there was so much chilli peppers\u00a0I could barely see the soup. Also, as a personal note, combining this spicy broth with late night drinking will result in very active bowels the next day.\nAddress:\u00a0260 Middle Rd, Singapore 188988 | Tel: +65 6333 5535\nOpening\u00a0Hours: 11am \u2013 5.30am Daily\n21. \u00a0Miss Lok\nTired of regular ol\u2019 hotpot? Try Miss Lok for some swanky contemporary hotpot inspired by the street food of our familiar neighbours \u2013 Malaysia, Japan, Korea, Thailand and China.\nLok Lok style hot pot with 8 different broths \u2013 including Singapore Laksa, Bak Kut Teh and something called the Asari Clam Sake Soup. Like many other hotpot places, you can concoct your own dipping sauce freely. They do have sauces of their own like their signature salted egg yolk sauce or Chinchalok etc.\nOther than hotpot ingredients, they also offer noodles that change seasonally. They have had flavours like green tea soba, Ma La Mee Tai Mak and\u00a0squid ink laksa. Take note that noodles are only available for lunch.\nAddress: 5 Magazine Road #01-01 Singapore 059571 | Tel: +65 6604 8814 | Website\nOpening hours: 6pm \u2013 2am Daily (Closed on Sunday)\n22. \u00a0Springleaf Prata Place\nSure it\u2019s another prata place but does your regular prata place sell Crispy Red Bean Prata, Eggs Ben Prata or even Prata Goreng? I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t. Eggs and oily food are also said to be really good hungover foods and I may or may not thoroughly agree with that.\nApart from the 2 more popular outlets \u2013 Upper Thomson and Tua Kong, Springleaf has recently opened another outlet at Rail Mall.\nAddress: No. 1 Thong Soon Ave,\u00a0Singapore 787431\u00a0| Various Locations | Tel: 64595670\u00a0| Website\nOpening hours: 8am \u2013 12am Daily\n23. \u00a0Xiang Ji Roasted Meat\nAddress: Block 302, Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4,\u00a0Singapore 680302\nOpening hours: 24 hours Daily\n24. \u00a0Seng Kee Herbal Soup (Changi)\nHearing the name \u2018Black Chicken Herbal Soup\u2018 might make you think it\u2019s one of those claypot soups where the black chicken sits quietly in the herbal stew, waiting for you to savour it.\nThis is not the case for Seng Kee, their herbal soup\u00a0is actually the soup base for their noodles. They are highly known for their Pig Liver Herbal Mee Sua that people flock from different corners of Singapore for. Only the main branch at Changi opens till 4am.\nAddress:\u00a0475/477 Changi Road, Singapore 419885\u00a0| Tel: +65 6746 4089\u00a0| Website\nOpening hours: 11am \u2013 4am Daily\n25. \u00a0Beach Road Scissors Cut Curry Rice\nI absolutely love Jalan Besar\u2018s Scissors Cut curry rice.\nYou\u2019ll be so confused by the uncle\u2019s need to use his scissors on everything \u2013 \u00a0your chicken chop, and basically almost every other dish you add, into thin bite sized pieces. But after confusion, mesmerisation sets in \u2013 how does one cut everything so precisely in a seemingly dance-like process of choppy popping-locking or should I say snipping-snapping?\nAddress:\u00a0229 Jalan Besar,\u00a0Singapore 208905 |\u00a0Tel: +65 9826 1464\nOpening Hours: 11am to 3:30am Daily\n26. \u00a0Spize\nEveryone knows this\u2014it\u2019s like if I don\u2019t write it down, some idiot\u2019s going to go \u201c How bout SPIZE?\u201d Geez louise, calm down. Do you see me saying McDonalds? Obviously not.\n(Spize is a really popular halal Indian-Malay-Western food place that almost always has a queue. Although their menu is pretty similar to other prata places, their prices are a tad higher. )\nAddress:\u00a0336 Bedok Road, Singapore 469512 | Tel: +65 6337 7493 | Website\nOpening hours:\u00a010.30am \u2013 4am Daily\n27.\u00a0 Hai Di Lao\nDon\u2019t be surprised to see drunk people here as well because Hai Di Lao opens until 6am. Of course it isn\u2019t the cheap kind of supper like Curry Rice or Prata, so the people eating there are probably ballers LOL.\nPerhaps the wide variety of food and superb service can make you look past the price.\u00a0Hai Di Lao\u00a0provides fuzzy soft\u00a0home slippers for you to rest your feet after a long night out, freak those heels (but please remember to bring them back don\u2019t forget your beloved heels, ladies).\nBest part, if someone gets really drunk, they have a wheelchair to wheel you out. So no worries, you\u2019re compleeetely covered.\nAddress: Clarke Quay, 3D River Valley Road,#02-04, \u00a0Singapore \u00a0| Tel: 6337 8626 / 6337 8627\u00a0| Website | Hours:\u00a010:30am-6am\n28. Changi Village Area\nChangi Village: Changi Village Road, Singapore 500002\n29. Char-Grill Bar\nYes, I\u2019ve added Char-grill Bar. But, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with Char-Grill\u2014they are actually pretty decent (at least at the outlets I\u2019ve patronised). The prices are really affordable and there\u2019s a wide variety to choose from \u2013 you can have fried fish, grilled meats, fries, pasta salad, baked potatoes; they all sound like really good food for midnight snacking!\nNote: While some outlets close at 11pm,\u00a0other outlets open till\u00a0late, like Yishun, Clementi West, Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 \u2013 check\u00a0their website for various outlets\u2019 opening hours.\nAddress: Bukit Batok Street 34, #01-25, Singapore 650347 | Website\nOpening Hours: 11am to 3am Daily\n30. Senor Taco\nSick of prata, rice, noodles or basically all the usual supper foods? Try Mexican.\nConsider having\u00a0some hearty Mexican street food like tacos, quesadillas and antojitos for supper. Mexican food is already a great beer go-with so if you\u2019re around the area drinking,\u00a0head\u00a0down to Senor Taco to fill your bellies.\nEditor\u2019s end notes\nYou may well disagree with me on my supper list. Nonetheless, do share your thoughts and comments as well as more suggestions where else I can eat at 2am in the morning\u2014I would be most interested to read them.\n* indicates required\nEmail Address *\nFirst Name\n$10 off promo code on dining vouchers\nGet $10 off over 600 dining vouchers from ChopeDeals when you subscribe to our free mailing list!\nName\nEmail\nRelated\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 7, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 6, 2020\nTuck Into Domino\u2019s SG Pizzas With Mother\u2019s Day Special Deal Till 10 May\nF&N Magnolia Singapore\u2019s New Brown Sugar Sea Salt Milk Now in Supermarkets\nMay 6, 2020\nMay 5, 2020\nAbout\nSETHLUI.COM is a Singapore Food, Travel, Nightlife online publication with more than 3 million page views each month.

Boon Lay Power Nasi Lemak opens till 3am every day, so you still enjoy its power-packed plate (from $4) of fragrant coconut rice even when its past midnight. It comes with a dollop of its all-important sweet-spicy sambal, along with a wide variety of toppings \u2013 fried chicken, fish, otah, and more \u2013 you can choose from. Don\u2019t stay in the west? Try popping by one of its vending machines around town to snag instant versions of its nasi lemak.\nOpen till 4am\nHead to Eminent Frog Porridge for an award-winning supper. It made it to the Michelin Bib Gourmand 2019 list, serving up piping hot bowls of frog legs till 4am daily. It's famous for the spicy kung pao version, cooked in dried chilli and soy sauce. But those\u00a0who want something milder can opt for the version where chillies are substituted with ginger and spring onions.\nOpen till 5am on Fri & Sat\nThe Dim Sum Place is one of the few Halal-certified dim sum joints in town, and probably one of the rare spots you can enjoy a Halal xiao long bao. Drop by on Fridays and Saturdays \u2013 its operating hours extend till 5am, allowing you and your friends to enjoy everything from steamed\u00a0dumplings to modern variants like deep-fried siew mai ($5.90).\nOpen till 5am\nRamen joints are all around town, but for a truly luxurious treat, try lobster ramen at Lobster King instead. Inspired by the French lobster bisque, the usual pork bone broth is swapped with French rock lobsters to lend richness to the soup base. Its shell, along with herbs and vegetables, is then simmered for some six hours to create the Lobster Clear Broth Ramen ($13.90). For something more intense, get the Lobster Broth Ramen (Rich Creamy Soup) ($14.90) where the stock is brewed for even longer to extract maximum flavour. The outlet at Clarke Quay opens till 5am \u2013 the perfect spot for the party people.\nOpen till 3am\nSometimes, fast food\u00a0just won\u2019t cut it. For nights when you\u2019re craving for a good, sizeable burger, 25 Degrees is the place to be. The popular Los Angeles import lets you craft your own burger creation, or grab the simply named Number One ($14) for a classic treat. It\u2019s layered with caramelised onions, cheese, bacon, and thousand island sauce. The restaurant is also opened till 3am for some greasy, late-night indulgence.\nOpen till 6am\nDon\u2019t be surprised to find a queue well into the early hours for a seat at Swee Choon Tim Sum.\u00a0This supper hot spot is a hit with\u00a0the post-clubbing crowd and night owls\u00a0that flock to the restaurant for its signature mee-suah kueh ($1/two), Portuguese egg tarts ($1.50/two) and custard-rich liu sha bao ($3.60/three).\nOpen till 5am\nUnlike its name, it serves more than just ramen. Chicken- ($11) and beef-based ramen ($12.90) are popular choices, but the restaurant also serves an equally enjoyable dry ramen ($11). The Ramen Stall\u2019s range of sushi also runs the gamut from prawn tempura rolls ($9.90) to soft shell crab maki ($17.90), but to really fill your belly, go for the teppanyaki beef ($16.90) or the kaisen don ($16.90).\nOpen till 3am\nIt's a no brainer \u2013 when you're drunk and hungry at 1am, some steamboat might do you good. Open till 3am (and 6am at the Centrepoint), Beauty in the Pot might help you get some late-night nourishment. Best part? After 10.30pm, diners enjoy a 20 percent discount\u00a0on food ingredients for the broth. All-time favourite soup bases include the\u00a0Beauty Collagen Broth and Spicy Nourishing Broth ($20 each) \u2013 and then add on premium ingredients like Kurobuta pork, assorted fresh fish, tofu, vegetables and more.\nRestaurants, Hawker\nOpen till 4am\nIt might be too hot to enjoy a piping bowl of soup during the day, but the coolness of the night makes it the perfect time to slurp up a bowl of Seng Kee\u2019s famous herbal mee sua ($5). Each bowl of nourishing soup comes swimming with vermicelli and slices of pork, kidney, and liver. Others make their way down for their herbal black chicken soups boiled with herbs like ginseng ($15) or cordyceps ($15). Not in the mood for soup? Seng Kee\u2019s rendition of the fried beehoon ($10) will give JB Ah Meng a run for its money.\nOpen till 2am\nIf you find the name familiar, this stall is actually set up by a relative of the original Song Kee Fishball Noodle owners. But things don\u2019t differ much.\u00a0Its famous fishballs, meatballs, and fish dumplings are still made by hand, and served with noodles tossed with spoonfuls of\u00a0homemade dried shrimp chilli paste.\nOpen till 3.30am\nThere\u2019s always a snaking queue at their outlet along Upper Serangoon Road during dinner time.\u00a0But since\u00a0it opens till 3.30am,\u00a0heading down for supper allows you to skip the crowd and get your nasi lemak fix. Their selection is extensive, but must-haves include the fried chicken wing and otah, along with a heaping spoonful of sambal.\nOpen till 4am\nChuan Chuan Le in the Jalan Besar area is your spot if you find yourself craving for Mala dishes and Sichuan cuisine late at night. Besides the usual dishes you might find at a Mala restaurant, you can also find a side menu of skewers. Think all sorts of meats and vegetables dusted in Sichuan spices and grilled till crisp. Need cheap beer to go with that? There's also a selection. If you decide to stick to the classic staples, that's all right too. Order the fried potato slices in Mala seasoning ($10) and sliced fish in hot soup ($18) for a late-night meal with your friends. The more the merrier!\nOpen 24 hours\nPublic Service Announcement time: formerly located at BK Eating House on South Bridge Road, the famous noodle stall has moved to a stand-alone shop across the street amidst rental feud rumours. Standing firm, the OGs are serving up the real deal at their new 24-hour joint (take note that it\u2019s closed on Sundays). You can still get that bowl of handmade mee sua noodles with fishballs, meatballs and minced pork all doused in chilli, vinegar and soy sauce for $4. Complete the dish by asking for extra crispy lard bits to top it off.\nOpens till late\nAt East Coast Lagoon Food Village, indulge in some of the tastiest local dishes by the beach, We're talking everything from sinful fried carrot cakes ($6) to charcoal-barbecued wings ($1.30 a piece). A couple of must-tries include Stingray Forever BBQ Seafood\u2019s sambal stingray ($12/15/20), Haron Satay 55\u2019s selection of chicken, beef and mutton satay ($0.70 per stick), Choon Hiang\u2019s Hokkien mee ($4/5/8), and Song Kee Fried Oyster\u2019s orh\u00a0luak ($5/8/10).\nOpen till 3am on Fri & Sat\nWhether it\u2019s to satisfy your midnight sweet tooth, or to finish off a savoury supper, stop by Rochor Original Beancurd for\u00a0tau huay and chin chow \u2013 or a mix of the two if that\u2019s how you like it. Closing at either 1am or 3am, depending on the day, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a couple of fried fritters best dunked in soymilk well into the night.\nOpen 24 hours\nOn late nights or early mornings\u00a0when you crave\u00a0prata, make a dash to\u00a0Srisun Express. Open all day, every day, this bustling restaurant serves South and North Indian comfort food, as well as some Malaysian, western, and local dishes. Despite this wide diversity of food, nothing beats a plate of good ol\u2019 prata (maybe even with egg or cheese) with its extensive range of curries. To top it off, get a tall milo tower to share with your other supper-hungry friends.\nOpen till 2am\nJB Ah Meng\u2019s new digs might be cleaner, brighter and bigger, but it hasn\u2019t lost its shiok appeal just because you can\u2019t dine on the road anymore. The crowds keep coming back for unbeatable zi char dishes like san lou bee hoon ($7-$14), the pancake-resembling seafood noodle dish that\u2019s the joint\u2019s star, and wok-tossed clams ($16) with copious amounts of garlic. The joint also does a killer rendition of white pepper crab (from $24) that\u2019s only mildly spicy, which allows for the natural sweetness of the crustacean to shine.\nOpen till 5am\nNot to be confused with the other hotpot joint of a similar name, Hai Xian Lao stays open till 5am to feed those late-night steamboat munchies. Come hungry because its buffet is available from 11am to 10pm daily and is priced at an affordable $34.80 per adult and $15.80 for kids. There are\u00a0nine soup bases to choose from, including a rich and fragrant laksa broth as well as the ever-popular Sichuan spicy soup. Order an unlimited range of dishes like deep-fried prawn paste chicken as well as premium meats and seafood to throw into your bubbling bowl.\nOpen till 3am on Fri & Sat\nThe queues for this homegrown chimaek joint are daunting at dinnertime, so load up during the wee hours instead. Chicken Up's soy ganjang ($12/four) and sweet yangnyum chilli ($12/four) wings are among our favourite KFC (that's Korean fried chicken for you) in the city. And we love getting sloppy with the kimchi-slathered fries ($18) and fingers of battered onion ($12) in between lugs of fruity soju cocktails ($25-$38).\nOpen 24 hours\nThe stretch of eateries across from Beauty World Centre is no stranger to tummies starving in the middle of the night. Most places like Joo Seng Teochew Porridge and G7 Sinma Claypot stay open past midnight but Al-Azhar has your back 24/7. The calorie-laden prata and butter chicken set ($7.90) is our pick after a night of drinking.\nOpen 24 hours\nWe all know Swee Choon is the go-to for late-night dim sum but 126 Dim Sum has an edge over its biggest competitor \u2018cos of its round-the-clock operating hours. It peddles more than a 100 different types of dim sum, running from staples like siew mai and har gao to more interesting bites such as braised duck wings and pork belly yam rolls.\nOpen 24 hours\nNo matter the time of day, you\u2019re sure to find a crowd gathering at Fei Fei Wanton Mee for a good \u2018ol bowl of char siew noodles. A $4 bowl comes loaded with roasted pork\u00a0and vegetables but nothing beats the homemade fried wontons that retain their crunch despite being mixed with a copious amount of chilli sauce.\nOpen 24 hours\nSo you\u2019ve just watched a late-night screening at The Projector or you\u2019re waiting for the bus to take you to Malaysia in the middle of the night \u2013 where do you go for a quick meal?\u00a0Why, Diandin Leluk, of course. The Thai eatery is one of the largest in Golden Mile Complex and the menu is just as extensive. There are the usual suspects \u2013 pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup and basil chicken rice \u2013 and a host of other Thai favourites.\nOpens till 4am\nForget that dim sum joint along Jalan Besar. For a comforting Chinese feast in the wee hours, nothing beats a steaming bowl of porridge and a fleet of humble yet hearty dishes. That a meal for two will only clock in at about $20 makes a trip to this supper haunt even better.\nJoo Seng\u2019s star dish, besides the porridge, of course, is the braised duck leg. It\u2019s\u00a0fall-off-the-bone tender and swimming in a savoury-sweet soya sauce base. The minced pork with black bean, another Teochew porridge staple, is flawless here, too. But whatever you do, it\u2019s obligatory to request for an additional bowl of dark zhup \u2013 you\u2019ll be liberally ladling that into your bowl, trust us.\nOpens till late\nBetter known as 'Block 85', this hawker centre in Bedok is famous across the city for one thing: the soup-based bak chor mee that\u2019s as comforting as a snug blanket on a rainy night. Don\u2019t believe the hype when it comes to the few stalls that sell it, though. Its differences are marginal at best.\nSave some tummy room for a bowl of Chai Chee Pork Porridge\u2019s namesake dish ($3.50). The Cantonese-style chok is almost obscenely gloopy and thick, and packed with enough liao to stop your hunger pangs. And always, always ask for a raw egg ($0.50) to be dropped into your rice.\nNightlife\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Home \u00bb 6 Places To Get The BEST Roti Prata In Singapore, According To Our Editors\n6 Places To Get The BEST Roti Prata In Singapore, According To Our Editors\nSatisfy your curry craving with these sinful spots.\n21 February 2020\nThey\u2019re totally worth it.\nThe humble roti prata is a beloved dish that is loved by many. When it comes to roti prata, there\u2019s simply no bad time to indulge in it \u2014 whether it is breakfast , lunch, dinner or supper, it\u2019s a comfort food that hits the spot every time, especially when accompanied by some kick a** curry .\nThere are so many options for prata, so who do we think flips and fries it best? Our editors give their take.\nPrevious\nNext\n1. Mr and Mrs Mohgan\u2019s Super Crispy Roti Prata\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a wait but it\u2019s completely worth it. The tiny sweet-salty coin prata is delicious. And the regular prata makes for a great breakfast with the curry. The best for me though is mutton murtabak, which has a generous filling of tender meat that makes it a meal in itself. My tip? Order the murtabak first and then head off for a workout. Come back in around an hour to enjoy it. Because the pratas are always freshly made and there are always so many orders, you\u2019d be better off spending the time in between doing something more productive.\u201d \u2014 Smita DeSouza,\u00a0Beauty Editor, CLEO\n\u201cTheir\u00a0prata\u00a0is seriously crispy and fragrant \u2014 the kosong is the best. You must try the dhal. If you\u2019re going on the weekends, you have to head there really early \u2014 they can be sold out by 10 am (or earlier). Also, I\u2019ve heard that some people can wait up to an hour for their\u00a0prata, so\u2026 be prepared.\u201d \u2014 Sophie Hong, Associate Editor, CLEO\nTin Yeung Restaurant, 300 Joo Chiat Road, 429356; tel: 9794 3124.\n2. Springleaf Prata\n\u201cExcellent standard\u00a0pratas\u00a0that aren\u2019t oily and have the right amount of texture that make them a joy to munch in your mouth. You can even try some of their extra special creations that are a cross between a pizza, murtabak and a\u00a0prata \u2014\u00a0Prata\u00a0Blaster, Murtaburger and more. Be warned that the fish/chicken/dhaal gravies are flavourful but they are not spicy. Great for those who dislike spicy food, but it lacks the extra punch for those who love hot curries.\u201d \u2014 Vijay Anand,\u00a0Editor-in-Chief, Hardwarezone.com\n\u201cI usually frequent the one at\u00a0Jalan Tua Kong. My usual combo would be the cheese, mushroom\u00a0prata; and then for dessert, I\u2019ll have the red bean\u00a0prata\u2026 yummy!\u201d \u2014\u00a0Barbara Koh,\u00a0Editor-in-Chief, The Singapore Women\u2019s Weekly\nAt various outlets. Visit www.spplace.com for info.\n3. Alwadi at Geylang Serai\nPhoto: Sara Lyle Bow\n\u201cI can\u2019t confess to having found this 24-hour spot myself; our nanny recommended it! According to her,\u00a0it\u2019s the \u201cdalcha\u201d (an Indian curry made from mutton, chana dal and tamarind) that makes this particular shop the best. It\u2019s a definite family favourite, especially with my three-year-old son who, without hesitation, says\u00a0prata is one of his favourite foods. My mom, too, insists on making multiple visits to Alwadi whenever she visits from America. The spot has yummy pisang goreng and tapioca fritters too.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Sara Lyle Bow, Editor-in-Chief,\u00a0The Finder\n970 Geylang Road, 423492.\n4. Ariff\u2019s Restaurant\nPhoto: Facebook\n\u201cThis restaurant is located near my house and they serve up possibly the best\u00a0prata. It\u2019s thick but crispy on the outside, and the curry is just divine. They have a selection of\u00a0prata\u00a0varieties to choose from, but you can\u2019t go wrong with their egg\u00a0prata. I have a friend who lives in the same neighbourhood and we never fail to meet up here every time we catch up over dinner.\u201d \u2014 Hidayah Idris, Associate Digital Editor, CLEO\n71 Kallang Bahru, 330071; tel: 6297 1024.\n5. Master Prata @ Alexandra\nPhoto: Facebook\n\u201cI love when a prata is nice and crispy, and the ones here have a crackling texture that lasts all the way until the very last bite. My favourite is the savoury and satisfying butter prata which has a nice fluffy interior, but the selection here is so wide that you can find all sorts of prata flavours to suit your tastes.\u201d \u2014 Wong Yen Leng, Deputy Editor, Nuyou\nAlexandra\u00a0Central, #01-02, 321 Alexandra Road, 159971; tel: 8268 8210.\n6. Casuarina Curry Restaurant\nPhoto: Facebook\n\u201c Casuarina Curry is my go-to spot whenever I have a prata craving.\u00a0I always go for a double egg cheese, and their version is warm, crispy, light and slightly oily on the outside, with a nice bite once you sink your teeth into the dough. Basically, it\u2019s everything you\u2019d ever want in a prata. What\u2019s more, their prata is of a generous size, and just one can fill you up pretty quickly. I like my prata with fish curry \u2014 theirs packs a flavourful punch, but my only gripe is it\u2019s not spicy enough.\u201d \u2014 Joy Fang, Former Associate Editor, Digital Trending Desk\n136, 138 Casuarina Road (off Upper Thomson), 579524; tel:6455 9093.\nPrevious\nNext\nBy Joy Fang, April 2019 /\u00a0 Updated February 2020\nMore on The Finder:\nDon\u2019t miss out!

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\nThe best prata shops in Singapore\nThe best prata shops in Singapore\nFit for breakfast, lunch, dinner and any time, roti prata is a local dish that can be eaten many ways\nOur version of a dream pancake breakfast is a lot more crispy, definitely more oily, a little more savoury and best served hot and fresh. This versatile dish can also be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper and an in-between snack. Take it with a side or curry or some sugar, there are also many ways to eat this local favourite. Sometimes with so much local food out there, it feels like we take roti prata for granted. Besides being ridiculously delicious, a good prata takes some serious skill as well, here are the ones we admire the most.\nYishun\nPeople talk about being 'extra' like it's a bad thing. Not if you're Springleaf Prata Place. Home to franken-pratas like the Murtaburger and Prata Alfredo, it is arguably the best place on the list for the most unconventional prata. Sometimes the wacky creations turn out to be so brilliant they become mainstays on the menu. Keep your eyes peeled for new creations.\nTRY THIS... The mega Murtaburger ($7.90) of course that is prata stuffed with a burger patty and lots of cheese. Prata Blaster ($5) is a take on eggs benedict but the bread is replaced with\u00a0crispy\u00a0prata, as well as the Umami 50 ($8.90), an egg prata with luncheon meat, cheese, chicken floss and mayo.\nGeylang\nOne of Singapore's best kept secrets, this small stall is only open on weekdays and even so, tends to run out pretty early so it might take you a few tries before you finally get to try it. It's all in the actual name of the shop, really. The prata kosongs here are super crispy on the outside and much fluffier on the inside. It may sound and look so simple but there's a reason why people keep returning to this gem in Joo Chiat.\nTRY THIS... What else? Start with a short stack of the roti prata kosong.\nSengkang\nThe first thing you'll notice when you walk into this Jalan Kayu establishment is the big ass signs proclaiming them to be the best prata around. Bit of a long shot but the 24-hour prata place does serve up pretty decent prata, albeit a little on the pricier side.\nTRY THIS... Keep it simple with the classic egg prata ($1.80) is fluffy and soft and best eaten warm.\nTanglin\nMr Prata, located near Evans Lodge and a stone\u2019s throw from the Botanic Gardens, churns out prata and rich curries to many a hungry soul in need of a 4am food-fix. The modest alfresco-dining establishment may be lacking comfort, but makes up for it with its diverse menu and brisk service. At the last count, more than 40 prata festooned the menu, complemented by both meat and vegetarian curry dishes from all over India, naan bread from the tandoor, and Singaporecentric fusions (see Mee & Meehoon Mix Goreng). Wash it all down with a manly Milo Godzilla and you\u2019ll be complete \u2013 at least till tomorrow, same time, same place.\nTRY THIS... The fancy tissue prata ($2) or the selection of murtabak (from $7) to fill you up.\nBukit Timah\nOn any given night (or morning) this coffee shop is packed to the rafters, a favourite spot to swing by for supper or post-clubbing/pre-dawn fuel. Happy and hungry punters tuck into favourite local dishes served, before finishing it all off with a super-sized Milo dinosaur or teh cino. But a main staple at this coffee shop? The roti prata stall of course.\nTRY THIS... The prata kosong here is more on the doughy side (our favourite kind) but still cooked well. Another must-try is also the fun-sized coin prata.\nToa Payoh\nQueues are long but that's okay if you've got patient and loyal customers like this one. Everything is made fresh from when you order so things might take a while. Despite the store name, what's a hit here is really the egg prata. Thick, fluffy and fresh, who needs cafe pancakes anyway?\nTRY THIS... Yeah, go ahead, try the cheese prata ($2) as well but do indulge in some egg pratas as ($1.50) too.\nBishan\nGo local with prata and teh tarik at The Roti Prata House, another classic long-running prata shop in Singapore. There are over 80 varieties of prata to choose, including ice cream, milo, durian and even a bomb cheese kaya prata \u2013 but we suggest sticking to the coin prata set.\nTRY THIS... The coin prata set ($7) complete with a curry will always be a classic.\nRestaurants, Hawker\nRestaurants, Singaporean\nRestaurants\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "9 Best Taiwan & Teochew Porridge Buffets in Singapore \u2013 2020 Price List\nby Clara Lim on 23 March 2020\nI\u2019m normally a rational person, until you put me in front of a good Taiwan or Teochew porridge buffet. All of a sudden, I think it\u2019s totally fine to pay $20 for unlimited servings of plain rice gruel and canned peanuts. I can almost hear you screaming, \u201cwah lao, damn waste money leh!\u201d\n\u2026 Unless, of course, you\u2019re just like me. Then you probably gian braised tau kee the same way \u201cfoodies\u201d fantasise about\u00a0atas French oysters and expensive champagne.\nHigh five! Now, read on for porridge buffets in Singapore to feast at.\n9 best Taiwan & Teochew porridge buffets in Singapore (2020)\nPorridge buffet\nManle\nThe ART (Assumption Pathway School)\nDinner (every last Friday of the month)\n$13.50 nett\nOrchid Hotel\nSpice Brasserie (Parkroyal on Kitchener)\nLunch\nSpice Brasserie (Parkroyal on Kitchener)\nDinner\nGoodwood Park\nLunch / Dinner\n$39++ (Mon to Thu) / $42++ (Fri to Sun)\nNote: Although many Taiwan/Teochew porridge dishes are seafood-, egg- and veggie-based, braised pork is also one of the staple ingredients, so it goes without saying that all of these places are not halal. The most halal-friendly option would be the ART, which doesn\u2019t use pork or lard in their cooking.\niSteamboat a.k.a Marina Square porridge buffet lunch ($8.80++)\nView this post on Instagram\nOct 13, 2018 at 8:27pm PDT\nMarina Square\u2019s somewhat infamous porridge buffet restaurant used to be called Hotpot Culture, but following a rat-related run-in with the NEA, they apparently reopened and rebranded themselves as iSteamboat.\nDespite the name, iSteamboat is better known for offering the cheapest porridge buffet in Singapore at just $8.80++ . Heck, that\u2019s cheaper than some of my Teochew mui meals.\nYou get free flow of 24 items including sweet potato porridge, sides like luncheon meat and chye poh eggs, PLUS unlimited drinks, ice cream and fried rice/bee hoon/kway teow. It\u2019s every bit as trashy as it sounds. If you bring a date here and he/she doesn\u2019t mind, marry him/her.\nPorridge buffet lunch: 11.45am to 2.45pm daily\nBuffet price: $8.80++\nView this post on Instagram\nApr 22, 2017 at 7:32pm PDT\nQuality Hotel\u2019s porridge buffet has been around for so long that it\u2019s the first place that comes to mind for many Singaporeans \u2013 especially those with late-night cravings for porridge.\nThat\u2019s because they have a really cheap supper porridge buffet at just $12.80++ on weekdays and $14.80++ on weekends. Apart from porridge and the sides like pickles and fermented tofu, there are also Asian buffet items like popiah, laksa, curry chicken, seafood dishes, and desserts. Super worth it!\nQuality Hotel also have a dinner porridge buffet, but at much steeper prices.\nSupper porridge buffet: 10.30pm to 12.30am daily\nBuffet price: $12.80++ (Mon to Thu) / $14.80++ (Fri to Sun)\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 10pm daily\nBuffet price: $26.80++ (Mon to Thu) / $28.80++ (Fri to Sun)\nManle porridge buffet lunch ($12.90+ / $16.90+)\nTeenager-ridden steak joint Astons has opened Manle , a Chinese restaurant that successfully replicates its winning formula (namely, cheap-a$$ prices) over to Teochew porridge and hotpot. It now has 2 outlets: City Square and Downtown East.\nAt $12.90+, Manle\u2019s Teochew porridge buffet lunch may be a little more expensive than ordering Teochew mui at the hawker centre, but then it comes with air con so you can comfortably gorge on their 30 dishes.\nAt Downtown East, the Teochew porridge buffet is only available at lunch. But at the City Square outlet, there is a dinner spread too, at $16.90+.\nPorridge buffet lunch: 11.30am to 3pm (Downtown East) /\u00a011.30am to 4pm (City Square)\nPorridge buffet dinner: 5pm to 10pm (City Square)\nBuffet price: $12.90+ (lunch daily at Downtown East, lunch from Mon to Fri at City Square) / $16.90+ (lunch on Sat & Sun + dinner daily at City Square)\nMake a reservation at Manle Downtown East:\nMake a reservation at Manle City Square:\nThe ART porridge buffet dinner ($13.50 nett)\nAlthough it\u2019s not your typical porridge buffet place, I just had to include the ART , the in-house restaurant of Assumption Pathway School. The ART is a training ground for students to hone their F&B and service skills.\nThe cafe usually serves individually plated Western food, but once a month, they put out a porridge buffet to let the students practise cooking local food in larger quantities. It\u2019s not halal, but they don\u2019t use pork or lard.\nSince the students tailor their cooking to the number of patrons, the porridge buffet is by reservation only. Email [email\u00a0protected] to reserve.\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 9.30pm every last Friday of the month\nBuffet price: $13.50 nett (adults) / $12 nett (children & senior citizens)\nCrystal Cafe Taiwan porridge buffet ($16.80++ / $18.80++)\nView this post on Instagram\nNov 26, 2017 at 7:12pm PST\nDid you know that there\u2019s actually a cheap Taiwan porridge buffet place along Orchard Road \u2013 and in a hotel, no less? \u2026 Okay, it\u2019s no Shangri-La, but Orchard Grand Court\u2019s Crystal Cafe has a certain \u201880s hotel charm, complete with obiang patterned carpet.\nAnyway, the star of the show is the simple and comforting Taiwan porridge buffet spread under $20 per head. Yes, even for dinner.\nI especially like that they have an extended lunchtime on weekends, so you can skip dinner after stuffing yourself with enough braised pork belly to feed a small Chinese army.\nPorridge buffet lunch: 12pm to 2.30pm (Mon to Fri) / 12pm to 4pm (Sat to Sun)\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 10pm daily\nBuffet price: $16.80++ (Mon to Fri lunch, Mon to Thu dinner) / $18.80++ (Sat to Sun lunch, Fri to Sun dinner)\nOne Farrer Hotel Teochew porridge buffet ($16++)\nGetting random hankerings for porridge in the middle of the night must be quite a thing here, because in addition to Quality Hotel, you can also get a supper porridge buffet at One Farrer Hotel\u2019s Escape restaurant on Fridays, Saturdays and eve of public holidays.\nOne Farrer\u2019s Teochew porridge buffet is simple but nice, with sweet potato congee and the classic dishes like steamed fish, pickled veggies and mei cai pork belly. The ambience is quite nice too, especially when you think about how you paid only $16++ for a hotel buffet.\nThe best/worst thing about One Farrer\u2019s porridge buffet is that it starts and ends super late. I\u2019m not willing to sacrifice my ZZZs \u2013 even for porridge \u2013 but it\u2019s definitely a plus for night owls looking for something other than prata.\nSupper porridge buffet: 11pm to 3am daily\nBuffet price: $16++\nOrchid Hotel porridge buffet ($18.80++ / $20.80++)\nThe only Teochew porridge buffet place in the CBD, Orchid Hotel\u2019s porridge buffet is a godsend for corporate slaves who just want to binge-eat all their problems away at lunchtime.\nOn top of the Teochew mui classics, Orchid Cafe also serves quite a lot of veggies and even a salad bar for those who want to eat a bit more healthy.\nPorridge buffet breakfast: 6am to 10am daily\nBuffet price: $22++ (adult) / $12.80++ (child)\nPorridge buffet lunch: 12pm to 2pm daily\nBuffet price: $18.80++ (adult) / $13.80++ (child)\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 10pm daily\nBuffet price: $20.80++ (adult) / $15.80++\nSpice Brasserie (Parkroyal on Kitchener) buffet ($32++ to $48++)\nView this post on Instagram\nApr 16, 2018 at 6:19pm PDT\nI apologise in advance to Teochew porridge purists for including this particular Asian buffet, but I needed to include an option that will satisfy both lovers and haters of porridge buffets who have to dine together.\nSpice Brasserie\u2019s Asian buffet isn\u2019t strictly a porridge buffet; it\u2019s more a \u201cnormal\u201d buffet with a decent-sized Teochew porridge counter (12 dishes). You also get the regular hotel buffet stuff like seafood, live stations, desserts and so on. This way, both species can have a satisfying buffet meal with minimal resentment.\nPorridge buffet lunch: 12pm to 2:30pm daily\nBuffet price (Mon to Fri): $34++ (adult) / $17++ (child)\nBuffet price (Sat to Sun): $50++ (adult) / $25++ (child)\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 10pm daily\nBuffet price (Mon to Thu): $42++ (adult) / $21++ (child)\nBuffet price (Fri to Sun): $60++ (adult) / $30++ (child)\nMake a reservation at Spice Brasserie:\nGoodwood Park porridge buffet ($39++ / $42++)\nThis one is super bo hua \u2013 eh, $50 can get you A LOT of food at a hawker centre Teochew porridge stall \u2013 but if you ever feel the need to burn a bunch of money\u2026\nGoodwood Park\u2019s Coffee Lounge is the place to be. Their Taiwan porridge buffet has been around since 1984(!) and is supposedly legendary.\nWhat\u2019s special about it is that it\u2019s the only a la carte porridge buffet on the list, so you\u2019re getting food specially cooked just for you, not sitting there in its own semi-congealed juices. (Though there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with semi-congealed juices.)\nInstead of the standard cheap dishes like salted egg and braised peanuts, you can get zi char-style dishes like steamed fish, stir-fried veggies/meat/prawn, and Japanese-style chilled tofu. There\u2019s also a selection of desserts more typical of hotel buffets, e.g. cakes and puddings.\nPorridge buffet lunch: 12pm to 2.30pm daily\nPorridge buffet dinner: 6pm to 10.30pm daily\nBuffet price (Mon to Thu): $39++ (adult) / $19.50++ (child)\nBuffet price (Fri to Sun): $42++ (adult) / $21++ (child)\nBonus: best dining credit cards in Singapore\nReady to dig in?

What breakfast? We\u2019d rather be sleeping in for a few more minutes, with absolutely no thanks to the continual late nights we have clocked in from work or, Netflix. Darn you Netflix with your trillion series that hook us in! Given the early hours we eventually drift off, it\u2019s mortifying to think about waking up half an hour earlier just for breakfast. Chances are, we end up foregoing our breakfast and start the morning hungry.\nThe result? We end up snacking on unhealthy snacks that are lying around the office while we wait impatiently for lunchtime, with a high possibility of overeating. The solution? Say hello to our trusty guide that features five best cafes and restaurants that are opened REAAAAL early (read: 7:30am) for you to take away your breakfast-on-the-go. You\u2019ll never have to go hungry again.\nhttps://www.womensweekly.com.sg/gallery/food/best-places-healthy-breakfast-singapore/\nSarnies\nimage\nA quaint little cafe that rests along Telok Ayer street, Sarnies serves larger-than-life sandwiches, salads, amazing coffee and more in the bustling CBD. Using quality ingredients such as grass fed beef; chicken free from hormones and antibiotics; bacon cured in-house \u2013 all so that you\u2019re guaranteed a fantastic meal every time.\nWe recommend: Cocowhip breakfast bowl with fruits \u2013 vegan nut granola and cocowhip original yoghurt, $10. Cocowhip is a vegan and bio-fermented coconut soft serve that is relatively guilt-free as opposed to a scoop of ice cream. We love the crunchy texture from the nut granola coupled with the natural sweetness from the fresh fruits. All of which complements the refreshing and velvety cocowhip \u2013 a definite treat for those with a sweet tooth and looking for a lighter option to start the day with. Sarnies is a distributor of roasted coffee beans, so you\u2019d be a fool to miss a cuppa there.\n136 Telok Ayer Street\nCrackerjack\nimage\nAn all-day drinking and dining venue along Tanjong Pagar Road, Crackerjack has recently introduced a grab-and-go breakfast concept. Staying true to Crackerjack\u2019s ingredients-drive philosophy, the breakfast items are wholesome and comforting, with an emphasis on making everything from scratch.\nWe recommend: Kale and chicken chimichurri wrap \u2013 shredded chicken, kale, onions, lemon juice, purple cabbage and housemade flour tortilla, $9. The lemon juice lends a subtle tang to the robust chimichurri chicken while the kale and onions add textures to the wrap. The wrap remains light and doesn\u2019t leave you with a food coma, which is a plus for morning productivity.\n43 Tanjong Pagar Road\nimage\nKith Cafe has been sprouting up all over our little red dot, now with an outlet on Cairnhill Road. Located within Ascotts, Kith Cafe opens at a whooping 6:30am to catch all the early birds. Expect good coffee and fuss-free breakfast choices conceptualised by their own chefs if you\u2019re looking to drop by before work starts.\nWe recommend: Kith Breakfast \u2013 toast, eggs, smoked bratwurst, crispy bacon, roasted tomatoes, rosemary garlic mushrooms, mixed greens, $19. Nothing screams hearty breakfast more than a full monty. Switching up the usual sausage for a bratwurst, it gives a more robust and smoky flavour, making Kith Cafe\u2019s rendition of a full monty a must-try. Complete with the usual suspects like eggs (anyway you like it), crispy bacon and more, you ought to order a cuppa to go with it.\n11 Cairnhill Road\nimage\nUltra industrial-like with bronze pipes and concrete flooring, Ronin Cafe on Hong Kong street is the kind of #homegoals we want. Other than having a stellar decor, Ronin Cafe also serves up serious coffee and honest meals that are simple and delicious.\nWe recommend: Eggs on toast, $11. Fluffy, the scrambled eggs are whisked thoroughly to give an even yolk colour throughout and we love how runny it is. If you\u2019re feeling for some meat, order a side of bacon to add a dose of savouriness to the meal. Balance all of that with some wilted baby spinach and you\u2019ve got yourself a wholesome breakfast.\n17 Hong Kong Street\nimage\nKnown for their signature cold brews and dairy-free nut milk, Oriole Coffee + Bar offers all-day breakfast. Health gurus listen up, you definitely have to try their M.A.D nut milk, which is a cold pressed nut milk made from macadamia, almonds and dates.\nWe recommend: Bircher \u2013 wholesome mix of greek yoghurt, rolled oats, green apples, apple juice, honey and Oriole\u2019s M.A.D. Milk. topped with a sprinkle of granola and fresh berries, $11. If you\u2019re not getting a dose of their nut milk from their cold brews, that\u2019s okay. Simply opt for the Bircher bowl that is an alternative to Sarnies\u2019 coconut yoghurt option. You get various textures from the fresh fruits, granola and rolled oats, with a subtle sweetness that comes from the honey and nut milk.\n#01-01, Pan Pacific Serviced Suites, 96 Somerset Road\nText: June Chen/ HerWorldPlus\nTips & tricks to stay sane + win invites to our events!\nSign Me Up Now !\n"

            "Dining Out 2 minutes 10 September 2017\nThe Breakfast Club: 6 Soya Beancurd Places To Get Out Of Bed For\nHot, cold, chopped or whole, tau huay is a beloved Singapore breakfast dish worth waking up for.\nShare\nThis deceptively simple-looking bowl of plain white pudding can be quite polarizing. Ask anyone and they\u2019ll have an opinion on just how they like it: hot or cold, with less sugar syrup, or with soy milk added in; some like to eat it carved from a whole block spoonful by spoonful, others like their tau huay all chopped up and mixed evenly into the syrup.\nTraditionalists like theirs straight up, with maybe a you tiao to dip with\u2014none of that newfangled chilled beancurd pudding, thanks\u2014while millennials might enjoy their bowl of silky goodness topped with bubble tea pearls or glutinous rice balls.\nIt\u2019s late night supper fare for some, but for many others, it\u2019s the perfect way to start the day. We round up 6 well-loved Singapore tau huay establishments worth getting out of bed for.\nTau huay is eaten as both a dessert and breakfast dish. Who says you can't have dessert for breakfast?\nWhampoa Soya Bean & Grass Jelly\nBlk 91 Whampoa Drive, #01-52 Whampoa Market & Food Centre, Singapore 320091\nOpening Hours: 6.30am-4.30pm. Closed on Mondays\nThis corner stall at Whampoa Market opens at the crack of dawn and serves only hot beancurd in their signature red bowls and metal spoon. Long lines are a usual sight but the wait is short and well worth it for tau huay that is still made traditionally using gypsum rather than commercial lactone. The result is silky soft beancurd that melts smoothly in your mouth.\nYong He Eating House\nOpening Hours: 24 hours\nSoya beancurd and various fried fritters are a Taiwanese breakfast staple, and so for a 20-year-old establishment specializing in Taiwanese snacks, Yong He is a favourite for many an old school tau huay lover. They do both the sweet and less common savoury version of beancurd.\nOpening Hours: 8am-8pm\nFounded in 1966,  this particular stall is three generations old and it\u2019s probably the only tau huay stall in Singapore with prices still in the 1960s at only 50 cents a bowl. Their other specialty is chin chow. Order a \u2018Michael Jackson\u2019 to try both, the local term for a drink of creamy soya bean milk mixed with strips of black grass jelly.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nSoya beancurd is the perfect blank canvas for a variety of toppings, including this version with gula melaka syrup\nTeck Seng Soya Bean Milk\n#02-69, Tiong Bahru Market, 30 Seng Poh Road, Singapore 168898\nOpening Hours: 5am-12pm\nYou\u2019ll recognize it when you see it: the rainbow colored sign on stallfront and the long snaking queue. The traditional beancurd is made fresh on site and the soya milk made by hand, not machine, slow cooked to bring out all the flavour of the beans.\nOpening Hours: 24 hours\nA tau huay list would be remiss without mentioning any of the famous Rochor beancurd places; you might know of the family saga resulting in three siblings opening their own beancurd stalls. Rochor Original Beancurd City are both as good, but Rochor Beancurd House at Geylang makes the list because it\u2019s the only one open for breakfast. Their tau huay is served hot or cold, with toppings like pearls, red bean and glutinous rice balls. Try also the Portuguese egg tarts.\nSelegie Soya Bean\nOutlets islandwide. See here for full list and opening hours.\nSelegie may be something of a chain now with outlets all around the island and even delivery service, but it still serves up a mean traditional beancurd with dough fritters for breakfast on the go.\nWritten by Rachel Tan\nRachel Tan is the Associate Digital Editor at the MICHELIN Guide Digital.

            "General information\nPlitvice Lakes is the oldest and largest national park in the Republic of Croatia. The park is situated in the mountainous region of Croatia, between the Mala Kapela mountain range in the west and northwest, and the Li\u010dka Plje\u0161ivica mountain range to the southeast. Administratively, the park falls within two counties: Lika-Senj (90.7%) and Karlovac (9.3%).\nWith its exceptional natural beauty, this area has always attracted nature lovers, and already on 8 April 1949, it was proclaimed Croatia\u2019s first national park. The process of tufa formation, which results in the building of the tufa, or travertine, barriers and resulted in the creation of the lakes, is the outstanding universal value, for which the Plitvice Lakes were internationally recognised on 26 October 1979 with their inscription onto the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1997, the boundaries of the national park were expanded, and today it covers an area just under 300 km2.\nThe park is primarily covered in forest vegetation, with smaller areas under grasslands. The most attractive part of the park \u2013 the lakes \u2013 cover just under 1% of the total park area.\nThe lake system is comprised of 16 named and several smaller unnamed lakes, cascading one into the next. Due to the geological substrate and characteristic hydrogeological conditions, the lake system has been divided into the Upper and Lower lakes. The twelve lakes forming the Upper Lakes are: Pro\u0161\u0107ansko jezero, Ciginovac, Okrugljak, Batinovac, Veliko jezero, Malo jezero, Vir, Galovac, Milino jezero, Gradinsko jezero, Burgeti and Kozjak. These lakes were formed on impermeable dolomite rock, and are larger, with more indented and gentler shores than the Lower Lakes. The Lower Lakes, consisting of the lakes Milanovac, Gavanovac, Kalu\u0111erovac and Novakovi\u0107a Brod, were formed in permeable limestone substrate, cut into a deep canyon with steep cliffs. The lakes end in the impressive waterfalls Sastavci, with the Korana River springing under the base of the falls.\nThe Plitvice Lakes National Park offers visitors seven different routes to tour the lake system, and four hiking trails. The park is open to visitors year round. All visitors are required to follow the instructions listed on the information panels, to keep on the marked trails, and to leave no traces of their visit, such as litter, or marking or devastating nature in any form.\nThe following is strictly prohibited in the National Park:\nCollection of plant materials, or taking any \u201csouvenirs\u201d of natural origin\nFeeding the animals\nSwimming in the lakes\nDisposal of litter along the trails or elsewhere, except in the garbage bins installed throughout the park\nStraying off the marked trails\nWe recommend:\nBringing adequate rain and sun protection (umbrella, raincoat; sunglasses, hat, sunscreen \u2013 depending on the season)\nCheck the weather forecast before coming to the park\nBe sure to check the information listed on our website about the length of certain trails, to ensure to you have enough time to complete the desired tour\nFor additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us!\nPlease take care of the natural environment you are visiting, because if we do not care for it today, our children will not have any place to visit tomorrow!\nWe wish you a pleasant stay at Plitvice Lakes National Park!\nFor more detailed information about the conditions in Plitvice Lakes National Park and the touring opportunities contact us by phone at +385 (0)53 751 014, +385 (0)53 751 015, or send an e-mail to info@np-plitvicka-jezera.hr .\nCopyright \u00a9 JU NP Plitvi\u010dka jezera, 2019.\nType and Press \u201center\u201d to Search\n"

            "Rottnest Island a popular spot for tourists off the coast of Perth renowned for its natural attractions \u00a9 Sarah Mills\nShare\nQuokka Western Australia\u2019s world famous wallaby \u00a9 Sam West\nIf you\u2019re ever lucky enough to meet a Quokka, chances are you\u2019ll break out in a grin. This popular marsupial is synonymous with Perth\u2019s favourite holiday spot, Rottnest Island \u2013 a short ferry ride from the Western Australian port of Fremantle. In fact, it\u2019s how the island got its name \u2013 Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh named it \u2018Rotte Nest\u2019 (\u2018rats\u2019 nest\u2019) in 1696, mistaking the ubiquitous small macropods (the kangaroo and wallaby family) on the beautiful Mediterranean-like island as giant rats.\nOf course the traditional owners of Rottnest Island, the Whadjuk Noongar people, knew of the island long before any European connection.\u00a0They call it Wadjemup, which means \u2018place across the water where the spirits are\u2019.\nRottnest wasn't always an island. Noongar people used to walk there during the last ice age around 6,500 years ago when lower sea levels meant it was connected to the mainland. For them it was an important place to meet and conduct ceremonies.\nAround 10,000 Quokkas live on Rottnest Island today. Very small populations also survive in the mainland\u2019s south-west forests such as those near Northcliffe. Overall the species is listed as vulnerable due to predation by feral animals (cats and foxes), altered fire patterns and habitat loss.\nTips for taking Quokka selfies\nThe Rottnest Island Quokka population has become very accustomed to humans. In recent years in particular, 'Quokka selfies' have become popular with tourists especially since tennis superstar Roger Federer and a Quokka starred in a government advertising campaign for the island, and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth shared his Quokka selfies online.\nHere are some tips for taking your own respectful Quokka selfies:\nBe patient - let the Quokkas come to you rather than chase them\nEarly morning and early evening are the best times\nQuokkas closest to the settlements are the ones most accustomed to tourists\nDon't touch the Quokkas!\nNever feed the Quokkas or give them a drink - human foods are very bad for their health\nQuokka selfie 2 for the price of 1! Rottnest's Quokkas have become 'insta-famous' for their selfies \u00a9 Matt Irons\nQuokka reproduction\nQuokkas give birth just 27 days after mating. The tiny, pink, hairless and blind joey then finds its way to its mother\u2019s pouch where it stays for around six months. If the joey doesn\u2019t survive, the mother can give birth to another one shortly after because she has others in her womb in a suspended state of development as back-up in case tragedy befalls the older joey.\nLike many macropods, when threatened, Quokka mothers may expel their joeys from their pouched leaving them squealing on the ground. A chasing predator is attracted by this giving the mother time to get away. It sounds harsh but it\u2019s better than both mother and baby ending up as prey.\u00a0 And it\u2019s another good reason why Quokkas shouldn\u2019t be harassed on Rottnest.\nDiet\nQuokkas are herbivores that eat a variety of grasses and shrubs. When food is scarce they can draw on stored fat in their tails for energy to get them through. As travellers to the island might know, fresh water is in short supply on Rottnest so it\u2019s just as well that Quokkas can survive on very little of it \u2013 lasting up to a month without a drink.\nQuokkas are herbivores that eat a variety of grasses and shrubs \u00a9 Sam West\nJunk food is bad for Quokkas too\nStudies have shown that the Quokkas found close to the human settlements on the east end of Rottnest are the social outcasts of the wild population.\u00a0 Scrounging for junk food high in salt left by island visitors can really dehydrate these individuals worsening their health. So - you guessed it - DON'T FEED THE QUOKKAS!\nThe Black-flanked Rock-wallaby is an endangered species\u00a0once widespread across many parts of Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. The clearing of its habitat, changes to fire patterns and, most devastating of all, introduced foxes and cats, all threaten its continued existence. It only survives today in small isolated populations within its former range.\nThe Nature Conservancy has proudly been a part of an ambitious rock-wallaby translocation project on\u00a0Martu Country, Western Australia.\nWatch this video about the wallaby rescue project\nBLACK-FLANKED ROCK-WALLABY The Nature Conservancy supported work to translocate rock wallabies within the Western Desert with a focus on increasing their population size and spread.\nLearn about our conservation work in Australia\nFind out how we're helping to conserve Australia's iconic natural landscapes and crucial wildlife habitats.\nWe respect Indigenous communities and culture.

Affordable diving packages makes Singapore an attractive investment.\nDiving in Singapore\nQuick facts\nThink Singapore. Think shopping; think hotels and restaurants; think international business hub. This buzzing metropolis, with five million people from all corners of the globe living on some 710 square kilometres/275 square miles of land, is an interesting and busy spot. Stop by Haji Lane, Sungei Road Thieves\u2019 Market and Ann Siang Road to get a taste of the myriad attractions as diverse as the country\u2019s vibrant culture. This island-based city-state in Southeast Asia is a beautiful place to visit.\r\n\r\nBut amid all the distractions, there are great diving experiences to be enjoyed and the opportunity for you to complete a range of PADI courses. Singapore is also a great place to shop for dive gear. It is extremely well served by PADI Dive Centers and Resorts. Local sites are worth exploring no matter what your level of experience and it\u2019s a perfect place to plan a longer dive trip to some of the world\u2019s best dive sites in nearby countries.\r\n\r\nIf you want to dive on a budget, Singapore is your best bet. Getting a certification here is an excellent deal, and is highly recommended. It is worth noting, however, that visibility can be rather poor off the coasts of Singapore. Because of the incredible amount of boat traffic and commercial fishing that occur offshore, the water is constantly churned. In some areas, visibility is only around 2 meters of visibility at its best.  Many people opt to travel to Malaysia, where diving is first class.\nRegardless, there are some gems hidden throughout Singapore that are definitely worth the trip. Local dive shops offer tours to nearby sites. Manta rays are often sighted, on these treks, sometimes in large groups. Sand tiger sharks also cruise along the sandy bottoms, and getting up close to one of these terrific creatures is sure to get your adrenaline pumping.\nRecommended training\nSingapore is a great place to learn to dive for those wanting to get their PADI with the PADI Open Water Diver course . For those certified, consider taking the PADI Advanced Open Water Diver course or a PADI Specialty course to hone skills prior to an expedition to Malaysia or Indonesia. Singapore is also a great destination, right in the heart of Asia, to become a PADI Divemaster or PADI Instructor .\nWhen to go\nTropical, hot and humid year round with daytime temperatures about 31\u00b0C/88\u00b0F. Northeast Monsoon brings frequent rain from December to March.\nRain and temperature\nClick to expand\nPulau Hantu - This is the most popular local dive site and it lies just off Singapore\u2019s southwest corner. At low tide, visitors to Pulau Hantu can walk between two islands, Hantu Besar and Hantu Kecil. There are hard and soft corals and an abundance of macro life including many different strange and wonderful nudibranchs. Tidal currents are a factor here and alert divers who can manage to look up from the reef may spot sharks or turtles. Don\u2019t expect to have the place to yourself on the weekends or holidays, but ease of access makes this a great local option.\r\n\r\nKusu Island - Its exposure and distance from the mainland mean Kusu Island, which means Turtle Island, is also well known by locals. The shallow reefs boast dense anemone fish populations and rich marine life. Part of the Saint John\u2019s islands, the region has been protected for more than 20 years.\r\n\r\nPulau Jong - Currents can be strong here mandating carefully planned dives. Pulau Jong is a tiny, unspoiled island with a healthy fringing reef. Look for blue-spotted rays and reef sharks.\r\n\r\nSingapore Wrecks \u2013 The Sudong Wreck lies in 15 metres/50 feet of water. She\u2019s about 50 metres/165 feet long and is basically in one piece. Strong currents make diving at slack tide and local expertise advisable. The Sisters Wreck, or the MV Iran Sarai, is a 50m/165 foot freighter lying upside down at about 18 metres/60 feet very close to Sisters Island. This wreck has seen the ravages of wind and wave and is breaking up slowly. Due to currents and an adjacent shipping lane, this dive is best undertaken at slack tide.\nWhat to see\nSingapore dive sites feature hard and soft coral along with the associated reef dwellers. Manta rays and whale sharks can be common on excursions to Malaysia.\nCalendar\nFor better readability of the table, pass into the landscape mode.\nMost likely sightingsPossible sightings\nCountry\nTucked beneath Malaysia is beautiful Singapore, a prosperous and diverse country of nearly 6 million people. Singapore is made up of one large, main island and many smaller islets, over 60, in all.\nBecause Singapore is only located one degree north of the equator, the temperature is fairly stable throughout the year, warm and humid.\nSingapore has a tumultuous relationship with its northern neighbor, Malaysia, having had an on again, off again relationship for the past several decades. Today, Singapore is one of the most competitive economies in the world; fast growing and innovative.\nOther attractions\nWhile visiting Singapore be sure to hit the city streets, where there is so much to do and see. After a day of shopping and diving, go to some of the many gardens which offer a cooling reprieve from the hustle and bustle of the city. The best three are the National Orchid Garden, the Gardens by the Bay, and the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\nGetting there\nSingapore\u2019s international airport and harbors are some of the busiest in the world, so coming into the country is a casual affair.\nTravelling throughout Singapore is just as easy, as the Mass Rapid Transit system is an incredibly efficient way to get around.\nUTC+08:00\nTime zone\nMain airport\nNote - Travel to any destination may be adversely affected by conditions including (but not limited) to security, entry and exit requirements, health conditions, local laws and culture, natural disasters and climate. Regardless of your destination, check your local travel advisory board or department for travel advice about that location when planning your trip and again shortly before you leave.\nSave that favourite\nWith a PADI Travel account, you can favourite dive operators to come back to later on any device or computer\n"

            "Destinations\nLocations\nOne of Thailand's many beautiful beaches | \u00a9 Photo_PG / Shutterstock\nThailand has no shortage of stunning coastline, with long stretches of shoreline along both the Andaman Sea and Gulf Coast in addition to more than 1,400 islands and islets. The nation is often said to have some of the world\u2019s most gorgeous beaches; here are 15 of the most beautiful to add to your bucket list.\nMaya Bay\nKoh Phi Phi\u2019s Maya Bay is often heralded as one of Thailand\u2019s most sublime beaches. Made famous in the hit movie The Beach, many visitors flock to the bay to walk in Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s footsteps. While tourism is definitely leaving its mark, there\u2019s no denying that the beach is still stunning. The soft white sands of the curved bay meet clear and sparkling karst-studded waters, with the dense jungle background adding to the visual magic .\nMaya Bay, Phi Phi Leh island, Thailand \u00a9 Iakov Kalinin / Shutterstock\nMorakot Cave\nThe stunning Morakot Cave is only accessible from the sea. Clear sparkling waters yield a small opening in the greenery-covered craggy rocks of Trang\u2019 s Koh Muk. Swim through the opening, with the booming sounds of waves crashing outside and eerily filling the darkness, to arrive in a small but sublime lagoon. High, jagged rocks enclose a stretch of white sand, lapped by waters of the deepest emerald green.\nThe beach inside the Emerald Cave, Thailand \u00a9 warut pothikit / Shutterstock\nRailay Beach\nOne of Krabi\u2019s many pretty beaches, Railay Beach is especially photogenic. With the sparkling waters of the Andaman Sea to one side and dramatic jagged cliffs to the other, this little slice of white-sand paradise can only be reached by boat. Quiet and laid-back, the views are incredible. Long-tail boats bob on the waves, the calls of birds fill the air, and monkeys swing through the dense foliage that clings to the rocks.\nRailay Beach, Thailand \u00a9 Dmitry Pichugin / Shutterstock\nAo Manao\nKnown in English as Lime Bay, Ao Manao is a beautiful beach close to Prachuap Khiri Khan town. With spectacular karst scenery and white sands to rival those in the more famous southern province of Krabi , Ao Manao has much smaller crowds. You can enjoy the gorgeous crescent-shaped beach in relative peace and quiet; it truly is a little slice of beach heaven. Access is through an army base, adding to the novelty factor, and there are several seafood restaurants and accommodations close to the tree-lined beach.\nAo Manao Beach in Prachuap Khiri Khan \u00a9 Stephane Bidouze / Shutterstock\nBottle Beach\nWhile Koh Phangan may be more famous for its wild Full Moon Parties and other raucous events, the island boasts beautiful sandy beaches and wildlife-filled patches of jungle too. One of the loveliest beaches is Bottle Beach . Accessible only by boat, the secluded nature keeps the beach peaceful and serene.\nBottle Beach, Koh Phangan, Thailand \u00a9 Judith Lienert / Shutterstock\nAo Kwang Peeb\nAo Kwang Peeb, on the island of Koh Phayam, couldn\u2019t be much more enchanting if it tried. A small but truly outstanding white-sand beach, large rocks poke up out of the clear waters and dot the sands at one end of the beach. The waters are suitable for swimming, offering a great way to cool down in the heat . Dense greenery encloses the beach, and there\u2019s only one (bumpy and rutted) track to reach the sands. Look out for hornbills in the trees, lazily swing from a strung-up tyre, and enjoy the tranquility of this secluded beauty.\nAo Kwang Peeb on the island of Koh Phayam \u00a9 Mod939698 / Shutterstock\nDonald Duck Bay\nOne of the most striking beaches on the Similan Islands, Donald Duck Bay can be found on Island 8. It takes its name from a large boulder formation that bears a resemblance to the popular Disney character. Powdery white sands meet deep blue waters that are teeming with aquatic life, and the lush jungle is home to an array of interesting flora and fauna.\nDonald Duck Beach, Similan Islands \u00a9 Myroslava Bozhko / Shutterstock\nFreedom Beach\nFreedom Beach is a crowning jewel on the island of Phuket , a destination that is known for its many sublime sandy beaches . You need to either scramble down a steep path or catch a long-tail boat to the beach, meaning that many people choose to stay on the easier to reach beaches. Those who do make the effort, however, will be rewarded by a 300-metre-long stretch of super-soft white sands surrounded by jungle and hills. The atmosphere is chilled out and there\u2019s little to shatter the air of tranquility.\nFreedom Beach, Phuket, Thailand \u00a9 Parshina Marina / Shutterstock\nSunrise Beach\nAlthough Southern Thailand\u2019s Koh Lipe is starting to draw bigger crowds, Sunrise Beach still feels like an undiscovered pristine tropical paradise. Boasting turquoise waters, white sands, and a relaxed ambience, a day here is nothing short of wondrous. Wake up early to welcome the new day and watch a glorious sunrise from the shores.\nSunrise Beach, Koh Lipe \u00a9 Sirintra Pumsopa / Shutterstock\nHat Khlong Chao\nA stunning beach on the gorgeous and quiet island of Koh Kood, Hat Khlong Chao attracts a diverse mixture of travellers and holidaymakers. Palm trees sway in the gentle breeze, providing welcoming shade in the strong sunshine. The sea is clear and blue and the sands are clean and white. There\u2019s a waterfall close to hand, along with a selection of places to eat, drink, and sleep, and the beach is a great place from which to watch a beautiful sunset.\nSunset at Hat Khlong Chao, Koh Kood \u00a9 Stephane Bidouze / Shutterstock\nPhra Nang Beach\nKrabi\u2019s Phra Nang Beach is often ranked among the most beautiful beaches across the globe . Catch a long-tail boat from the party beach of Ao Nang to marvel at the stunning views and soak up the relaxed vibe. The white sands are flanked by towering cliffs, limestone rocks rise majestically from the shimmering waters, and there\u2019s an interesting cave filled with phallus-shaped offerings. Add coral reefs, sea caves, and a sprinkling of food and drink vendors and it\u2019s a veritable tropical beach haven.\nPhra Nang Beach, Krabi \u00a9 Ilya Sviridenko / Shutterstock\nHaad Puk Tian\nAn offbeat beach in Phetchaburi Province , Haad Puk Tian has golden sands lapped by bluey-green waters. The coastal views are lovely, the large literary statues that dot the shore really add to the appeal. Characters from one of Thailand\u2019s most famous epic poems , Phra Apia Mani sit along the sands, in the water, and on rocks.\nStatues at Puk Tien Beach, Phetchaburi \u00a9 Anirut Thailand / Shutterstock\nAo Sai Daeng\nCombining soft pinkish-tinged pale sands, rugged rocks, and sparkling waters, the off-the-beaten-track Ao Sai Daeng can be found on the island of Koh Tao . You can see Shark Island close by and coral reefs create an interesting underwater world; snorkelling is possible right from the beach. Clean, attractive, and quiet, it\u2019s a pleasant place to unwind for a few hours, soak up the sun, and admire the captivating views.\nSai Daeng Beach on Koh Tao \u00a9 Sheva07 / Shutterstock\nKantiang Beach\nA remote beach on Krabi\u2019s island of Koh Lanta, Kantiang Beach is located within Mu Koh Lanta National Park. Turquoise waters meet golden sands and an old lighthouse sits atop the cliffs. Although rare, you may even spot monkeys walking along the sands! The beach isn\u2019t crowded and it\u2019s not uncommon to find just a handful of other sunbathers at any given time.\nKantiang Beach, Koh Lanta \u00a9 Anna Ewa Bieniek / Shutterstock\nTaling Ngam\nKoh Samui\u2019s Taling Ngam boasts awesome views of the small green islands and islets that speckle the blue waters to form the gorgeous Angthong Marine National Park. Hidden by wildlife-rich jungle, the sandy beach has a lazy and unhurried air. It\u2019s also a top spot to watch a spectacular sunset.\nTaling Ngam Beach in Koh Samui, Thailand \u00a9 Levranii / Shutterstock\n"

            "How to Meditate\nWhen we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives: We lower our stress levels, we get to know our pain, we connect better, we improve our focus, and we're kinder to ourselves. Let us walk you through the basics in our new mindful guide on how to meditate.\nmoneti/Adobe Stock\nThis is a guidebook to the many different styles of meditation, the various benefits of each practice, plus free guided audio practices that help you learn how to meditate.\nHow do you learn to meditate? In mindfulness meditation, we\u2019re learning how to pay attention to the breath as it goes in and out, and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and mindfulness .\nWhen we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present moment\u2014to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.\nIn mindfulness practice, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present moment\u2014to anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.\nThe idea behind mindfulness seems simple\u2014the practice takes patience. Indeed, renowned meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg recounts that her first experience with meditation showed her how quickly the mind gets caught up in other tasks. \u201cI thought, okay, what will it be, like, 800 breaths before my mind starts to wander? And to my absolute amazement, it was one breath, and I\u2019d be gone,\u201d says Salzberg.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\nGet mindfulness meditation practices, research, and special offers from our Mindful community delivered to you.\nEmail\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\nWhile meditation isn\u2019t a cure-all, it can certainly provide some much-needed space in your life. Sometimes, that\u2019s all we need to make better choices for ourselves, our families, and our communities. And the most important tools you can bring with you to your meditation practice are a little patience, some kindness for yourself, and a comfortable place to sit.\nA Basic Meditation for Beginners\nThe first thing to clarify: What we\u2019re doing here is aiming for mindfulness, not some process that magically wipes your mind clear of the countless and endless thoughts that erupt and ping constantly in our brains. We\u2019re just practicing bringing our attention to our breath, and then back to the breath when we notice our attention has wandered.\nGet comfortable and prepare to sit still for a few minutes. After you stop reading this, you\u2019re going to simply focus on your own natural inhaling and exhaling of breath.\nFocus on your breath. Where do you feel your breath most? In your belly? In your nose? Try to keep your attention on your inhale and exhale.\nFollow your breath for two minutes. Take a deep inhale, expanding your belly, and then exhale slowly, elongating the out-breath as your belly contracts.\nWelcome back. What happened? How long was it before your mind wandered away from your breath? Did you notice how busy your mind was even without consciously directing it to think about anything in particular? Did you notice yourself getting caught up in thoughts before you came back to reading this? We often have little narratives running in our minds that we didn\u2019t choose to put there, like: \u201cWhy DOES my boss want to meet with me tomorrow?\u201d \u201cI should have gone to the gym yesterday.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got to pay some bills\u201d or (the classic) \u201cI don\u2019t have time to sit still, I\u2019ve got stuff to do.\u201d\nWe \u201cpractice\u201d mindfulness so we can learn how to recognize when our minds are doing their normal everyday acrobatics, and maybe take a pause from that for just a little while so we can choose what we\u2019d like to focus on.\nIf you experienced these sorts of distractions (and we all do), you\u2019ve made an important discovery: simply put, that\u2019s the opposite of mindfulness. It\u2019s when we live in our heads, on automatic pilot, letting our thoughts go here and there, exploring, say, the future or the past, and essentially, not being present in the moment. But that\u2019s where most of us live most of the time\u2014and pretty uncomfortably, if we\u2019re being honest, right? But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\nWe \u201cpractice\u201d mindfulness so we can learn how to recognize when our minds are doing their normal everyday acrobatics, and maybe take a pause from that for just a little while so we can choose what we\u2019d like to focus on. In a nutshell, meditation helps us have a much healthier relationship with ourselves (and, by extension, with others).\nWhy learn to Meditate?\nWhen we meditate, we inject far-reaching and long-lasting benefits into our lives. And bonus: you don\u2019t need any extra gear or an expensive membership.\nHere are five reasons to meditate:\n1: Understand your pain\n2: Lower your stress\nHow to Meditate\nMeditation is simpler (and harder) than most people think. Read these steps, make sure you\u2019re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:\n1) Take a seat\nFind a place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.\n2) Set a time limit\nIf you\u2019re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.\n3) Notice your body\nYou can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel\u2014all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.\n4) Feel your breath\nFollow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.\n5) Notice when your mind has wandered\nInevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered\u2014in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes\u2014simply return your attention to the breath.\n6) Be kind to your wandering mind\nDon\u2019t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.\n7) Close with kindness\nWhen you\u2019re ready, gently lift your gaze\u00a0(if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.\nThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the practice. You go away, you come back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible.\nMeditation 101: The Basics\nTry this 3-part guided audio series from Barry Boyce:\nHow long would you like to meditate?

We\u2019ve tapped mindfulness teacher Elisha Goldstein to craft our premium How to Meditate Course. If you\u2019re interested in learning various meditation techniques to help you find focus, feel peace, and uncover your inner power, please explore our Mindful Online Learning School.\nTry this free sample of our How to Meditate Course: Making Mindfulness a Habit\u2014with Dr. Elisha Goldstein.\nHow to Make Mindfulness a Habit\nIt\u2019s estimated that 95% of our behavior runs on autopilot. That\u2019s because neural networks underlie all of our habits, reducing our millions of sensory inputs per second into manageable shortcuts so we can function in this crazy world. These default brain signals are so efficient that they often cause us to relapse into old behaviors before we remember what we meant to do instead.\nMindfulness is the exact opposite of these default processes. It\u2019s executive control rather than autopilot, and enables intentional actions, willpower, and decisions. But that takes practice. The more we activate the intentional brain, the stronger it gets. Every time we do something deliberate and new, we stimulate neuroplasticity, activating our grey matter, which is full of newly sprouted neurons that have not yet been groomed for \u201cautopilot\u201d brain.\nBut here\u2019s the problem: While our intentional brain knows what is best for us, our autopilot brain causes us to shortcut our way through life. So how can we trigger ourselves to be mindful when we need it most? This is where the notion of \u201cbehavior design\u201d comes in. It\u2019s a way to put your intentional brain in the driver\u2019s seat. There are two ways to do that\u2014first, slowing down the autopilot brain by putting obstacles in its way, and second, removing obstacles in the path of the intentional brain, so it can gain control.\nShifting the balance to give your intentional brain more power takes some work, though. Here are some ways to get started.\nPut meditation reminders around you. If you intend to do some yoga or to meditate, put your yoga mat or your meditation cushion in the middle of your floor so you can\u2019t miss it as you walk by.\nRefresh your reminders regularly. Say you decide to use sticky notes to remind yourself of a new intention. That might work for about a week, but then your autopilot brain and old habits take over again. Try writing new notes to yourself; add variety or make them funny. That way they\u2019ll stick with you longer.\nCreate new patterns. You could try a series of \u201cIf this, then that\u201d messages to create easy reminders to shift into the intentional brain. For instance, you might come up with, \u201cIf office door, then deep breath,\u201d as a way to shift into mindfulness as you are about to start your workday. Or, \u201cIf phone rings, take a breath before answering.\u201d Each intentional action to shift into mindfulness will strengthen your intentional brain.\nMore Styles of Mindfulness Meditation\nOnce you have explored a basic seated meditation practice, you might want to consider other forms of meditation including walking and lying down. Whereas the previous meditations used the breath as a focal point for practice, these meditations below focus on different parts of the body.\nIntroduction to the Body Scan Meditation\nTry this: feel your feet on the ground right now. In your shoes or without, it doesn\u2019t matter. Then track or scan over your whole body, bit by bit\u2014slowly\u2014all the way up to the crown of your head. The point of this practice is to check in with your whole body: Fingertips to shoulders, butt to big toe. Only rules are: No judging, no wondering, no worrying (all activities your mind may want to do); just check in with the physical feeling of being in your body. Aches and pains are fine. You don\u2019t have to do anything about anything here. You\u2019re just noticing.\nBody Scan Meditation\n25:41\nA brief body awareness practice for tuning in to sensations, head-to-toe.\nBegin to focus your attention on different parts of your body. You can spotlight one particular area or go through a sequence like this: toes, feet (sole, heel, top of foot), through the legs, pelvis, abdomen, lower back, upper back, chest shoulders, arms down to the fingers, shoulders, neck, different parts of the face, and head. For each part of the body, linger for a few moments and notice the different sensations as you focus.\nThe moment you notice that your mind has wandered, return your attention to the part of the body you last remember.\nIf you fall asleep during this body-scan practice, that\u2019s okay. When you realize you\u2019ve been nodding off, take a deep breath to help you reawaken and perhaps reposition your body (which will also help wake it up). When you\u2019re ready, return your attention to the part of the body you last remember focusing on.\nIntroduction to the Walking Meditation\nFact: Most of us live pretty sedentary lives, leaving us to build extra-curricular physical activity into our days to counteract all that. Point is: Mindfulness doesn\u2019t have to feel like another thing on your to-do list. It can be injected into some of the activities you\u2019re already doing. Here\u2019s how to integrate a mindful walking practice into your day.\nWalking Meditation\n8:58\nA mindful movement practice for bringing awareness to what we feel with each step.\nAs you begin, walk at a natural pace. Place your hands wherever comfortable: on your belly, behind your back, or at your sides.\nIf you find it useful, you can count steps up to 10, and then start back at one again. If you\u2019re in a small space, as you reach ten, pause, and with intention, choose a moment to turn around.\nWith each step, pay attention to the lifting and falling of your foot. Notice movement in your legs and the rest of your body. Notice any shifting of your body from side to side.\nWhatever else captures your attention, come back to the sensation of walking. Your mind will wander, so without frustration, guide it back again as many times as you need.\nParticularly outdoors, maintain a larger sense of the environment around you, taking it all in, staying safe and aware.\nIntroduction to Loving-Kindness Meditation\nYou cannot will yourself into particular feelings toward yourself or anyone else. Rather, you can practice reminding yourself that you deserve happiness and ease and that the same goes for your child, your family, your friends, your neighbors, and everyone else in the world.\nA Loving-Kindness Meditation\n17:49\nExplore this practice to extend compassion to yourself, those around you, and the larger world.\nThis loving-kindness practice involves silently repeating phrases that offer good qualities to oneself and to others.\nYou can start by taking delight in your own goodness\u2014calling to mind things you have done out of good-heartedness, and rejoicing in those memories to celebrate the potential for goodness we all share.\nSilently recite phrases that reflect what we wish most deeply for ourselves in an enduring way. Traditional phrases are:\n\u2022 May I live in safety.\n\u2022 May I have mental happiness (peace, joy).\n\u2022 May I have physical happiness (health, freedom from pain).\n\u2022 May I live with ease.\nRepeat the phrases with enough space and silence between so they fall into a rhythm that is pleasing to you. Direct your attention to one phrase at a time.\nEach time you notice your attention has wandered, be kind to yourself and let go of the distraction. Come back to repeating the phrases without judging or disparaging yourself.\nAfter some time, visualize yourself in the center of a circle composed of those who have been kind to you, or have inspired you because of their love. Perhaps you\u2019ve met them, or read about them; perhaps they live now, or have existed historically or even mythically. That is the circle. As you visualize yourself in the center of it, experience yourself as the recipient of their love and attention. Keep gently repeating the phrases of loving-kindness for yourself.\nTo close the session, let go of the visualization, and simply keep repeating the phrases for a few more minutes. Each time you do so, you are transforming your old, hurtful relationship to yourself, and are moving forward, sustained by the force of kindness.\nmore guided Meditation practices\n11:42\nA practice for difficult emotions, RAIN is an acronym for Recognition of what is going on; Acceptance of the experience, just as it is; Interest in what is happening; and Nurture with loving presence.\nA Mindfulness Practice to Foster Forgiveness\n11:13\nExplore this practice to let go of the tendency to add to our suffering during challenging situations.\nsign up for our newsletter\nGet mindfulness meditation practices, research, and special offers from our Mindful community delivered to you.\nEmail\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\nCommon Questions About Mindfulness Meditation Answered\nWhen you\u2019re new to meditation, it\u2019s natural for questions to pop up often. These answers may ease your mind.\n1) If I have an itch, can I scratch it?\nYes\u2014however, first try scratching it with your mind before using your fingers.\n2) Should I breathe fast or slow or in between?\nOnly worry if you\u2019ve stopped breathing. Otherwise, you\u2019re doing fine. Breath in whatever way feels comfortable to you.\n3) Should my eyes be open or closed?\nNo hard-and-fast rules. Try both. If open, not too wide, and with a soft, slightly downward gaze, not focusing on anything in particular. If closed, not too hard, and not imagining anything in particular in your mind\u2019s eye.\n4) Is it possible I\u2019m someone who just CANNOT meditate?\nWhen you find yourself asking that question, your meditation has officially begun. Everyone wonders that. Notice it. Escort your attention back to your object of focus (the breath). When you\u2019re lost and questioning again, come back to the breathe again. That\u2019s the practice. There\u2019s no limit to the number of times you can be distracted and come back to the breath. Meditating is not a race to perfection\u2014It\u2019s returning again and again to the breath.\n5) Is it better to practice in a group or by myself?\nBoth are great! It\u2019s enormously supportive to meditate with others. And, practicing on your own builds discipline.\n6) What\u2019s the best time of day to meditate? Whatever works. Consider your circumstances: children, pets, work. Experiment. But watch out. If you always choose the most convenient time, it will usually be tomorrow.\n7) What if I get sexually (and physically) aroused by thoughts in my head?\nNo big deal. Meditation stokes the imagination. In time, every thought and sensation will pop up (so to speak). And come back. Same old story. Release the thought, bring awareness and receptivity to body sensations, bring attention back to your chosen object (the breath, in this case). Repeat.\n8) Do you have any tips on integrating pets into meditation practice?\nWhile meditating, we don\u2019t have to fight off distractions like a knight slaying dragons. If your dog or cat comes into the room and barks and meows and brushes up against you or settles down on a part of your cushion, no big deal. Let it be. What works less well is to interrupt your session to relate to them. If that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, try to find a way to avoid their interrupting your practice.\nHOW MUCH SHOULD I MEDITATE?\nMeditation is no more complicated than what we\u2019ve described above. It is that simple \u2026 and that challenging. It\u2019s also powerful and worth it. The key is to commit to sit every day, even if it\u2019s for five minutes. Meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg says: \u201cOne of my meditation teachers said that the most important moment in your meditation practice is the moment you sit down to do it. Because right then you\u2019re saying to yourself that you believe in change, you believe in caring for yourself, and you\u2019re making it real. You\u2019re not just holding some value like mindfulness or compassion in the abstract, but really making it real.\u201d\ngo deeper\nExplore Mindful\nMindful has many resources to help you live a more mindful life and tap into the best of who you are:\nLoch Kelly\nRhonda Magee\nLinda Graham\nSharon Salzberg\nKelly Barron\nLoch Kelly\nGet mindfulness meditation practices, research, and special offers from our Mindful community delivered to you.\nEmail\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\nAbout the author\nMindful Staff\nMindful Staff editors work on behalf of Mindful magazine, Mindful.org, and the Foundation for a Mindful Society to write, edit and curate the best insights, information, and inspiration to help us all live more mindfully.\nComments\nComments\n"

        "wordList": [
            "Wikipedia list article\n(November 2019)\nThe tallest buildings in 2020\nThis list of tallest buildings includes skyscrapers with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350\u00a0m. Non-building structures , such as towers , are not included in this list (see list of tallest buildings and structures ).\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt , which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in England in 1311. Until the completion of the Washington Monument in 1884 the world's tallest buildings were churches and cathedrals, Christian places of worship, in Europe. The early skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago , forming the basis for which the United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building for much of the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then only two more buildings have held the title: Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa .\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, Western Asia , China , and Southeast Asia has had a boom in skyscraper construction.\nContents\nRanking criteria and alternatives\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. [3] The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828\u00a0m (2,717\u00a0ft). [3] However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller, [4] the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\nheight to structural or architectural top;\nheight to floor of highest occupied floor;\nheight to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009); [5] and\nheight to top of any part of the building.\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building . The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire and was 282.5\u00a0m (927\u00a0ft) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1\u00a0m (125\u00a0ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9\u00a0m (1,046\u00a0ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb , the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255\u00a0m (837\u00a0ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible. [6]\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied. [7] [8]\nTallest buildings in the world\nAs of 2020 [update] , this list includes all 75 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out ) which reach a height of 350 metres (1,150\u00a0ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Of these, 37 are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as ' tallest building ' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at 417 metres (1,368\u00a0ft) after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the twin towers had not been destroyed and One World Trade Center never built, the WTC towers would rank 34 and 35 on the list today.\nbold\nDenotes building that is or was once the tallest in the world\nRank\nName\nImage\nCity\nCountry\n4\nShares the record of the highest observation deck with Shanghai Tower (#2) at 562 m.\n5\n11\nShanghai\nChina\n492\n1,614\n101\n2008\nWas the tallest building in China until the completion of the adjacent Shanghai Tower.\n12\n472\n1,550\n98\n2020\nTallest residential building in the world.

This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now named Willis Tower ) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\nIf the World Trade Center towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 12 (North Tower at 526.7\u00a0m (1,728\u00a0ft)) [13] and 37 on the list (or 11 and 36, for it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).\nDenotes building with pinnacle height higher than architectural\nRank\nBuilding\nCity\nCountry\nHeight\nFloors\nBuilt\n1\nHeight to occupied floor\nThis height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest occupied floor within the building.\nRank\nBuilding\nCity\nCountry\nHeight\nFloors\nBuilt\n1\nBuildings under construction\nThis is a list of buildings taller than 350\u00a0m that are currently under construction.

            "February 15, 2016\nFebruary\u2026Chinese New Year festivities and the month of love and romance! But do you remember the important event Singapore commemorates in the same month?\nObserved annually on 15 February, Total Defence Day marks Singapore\u2019s fall to the Japanese in 1942. This commemoration seeks to remind people of the pain and suffering endured by our forefathers during the Japanese Occupation, as well as to instill the strategy of \u201cTotal Defence\u201d in our people, understanding that each one has a part to play in the survival of our country.\nTo learn more about the Japanese Occupation in Singapore and the tenacious spirits of our forefathers in protecting this land, here are the 5 war museums in Singapore you should visit.\nLocated on Sentosa Island, Fort Siloso is the only preserved coastal fort in Singapore today. It was initially built in the 1880s to protect the island from sea invasion, and the guns were turned inwards facing the land when the Japanese invaded during World War II. Upon seizing Singapore, the Japanese used the fort as a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp.\nToday, Fort Siloso is a military museum with gun displays and remains of military structures and tunnels. Admission is free, but admission into the Surrender Chambers is chargeable. The Surrender Chambers feature waxworks of the British Surrender at the Old Ford Factory, commentaries, and exhibitions. Guided tours are available too.\nSiloso Point, Sentosa Island\nImage Credits: Channel News Asia\nThe Changi Museum provides valuable but heartwrenching insights of the POWs\u00a0who were taken into captivity during the Japanese Occupation. The exhibitions are split into five sections, showing visitors what happened during the war through a collection of photographs, paintings, letters and personal artefacts donated by former POWs.\u00a0Wartime art pieces produced by the prisoners are also on display, recording their experiences in Changi Prison.\u00a0Changi Chapel, dedicated to the memory of the POWs and the civilian internees, is located on the museum grounds as well.\nVisitors can choose to go on a guided tour, or rent an audio set to listen to first-hand stories and experiences of the POWs.\n1000 Upper Changi Road North\nDaily: 9.30am-5pm (last entry at 4.30pm)\nImage Credits: YourSingapore.com\nReflections at Bukit Chandu is a heritage centre housed in a restored colonial bungalow. Bukit Chandu (Malay for Opium Hill) was where one of the fiercest and last significant battles took place before the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese. The Battle of Pasir Panjang, also known as the Battle of Bukit Chandu, saw 1400 valiant soldiers from the Malay Regiment fight dauntlessly against a 13 000 strong Japanese army. Despite being severely outnumbered, Lieutenant Adnan Saidi refused to retreat and surrender, and the troops even engaged in hand-to-hand combat after running out of ammunition.\nThe museum exhibits photographs, maps, artefacts and interactive media, showcasing the tenacity of the Malay Regiment, and other wartime experiences.\n31-K Pepys Road\n4. The Battle Box\nImage Credits: ST Photos Lim Sin Thai\nThe Battle Box is\u00a0a 9m deep emergency bunker located beneath\u00a0Fort Canning Hill, where the British army set up their headquarters in Singapore. It was once the nerve centre of British military operations, consisting of 30 rooms including a cipher room where messages were decoded, a signal control room, and a gun operations room.\nThe Battle Box is also the site where Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, the General Officer Commanding (Malaya), held a conference to discuss the war situation with other commanders, and then reached the decision to surrender to the Japanese.\nThe bunker was later converted into a museum in 1992, with artefacts on display depicting the final days before Singapore fell to the Japanese. It has recently undergone a revamp, and will feature multimedia guides, 3D technologies, and a retelling of the story of Singapore\u2019s capture.\n2 Cox Terrace\nThe Ford Motor Factory was the site where the British surrendered Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, drastically altering the lives of the people in Singapore. Lieutenant-General\u00a0Tomoyuki Yamashita, head of the Japanese invading forces, seized the factory as his headquarters after capturing Bukit Timah, and demanded for the British\u2019s unconditional surrender.\nDuring the Japanese Occupation, the factory was used to assemble military trucks and other vehicles for the Japanese war effort. Today, the restored factory captures the memories and reflections of the hardships faced by those who had lived through the war. Visit the Boardroom of Surrender where the Surrender Papers were signed, and the Syonan Garden where some of the common food items during the wartime are grown. The Talking Map is an interactive exhibit that traces the route of the Japanese as the advanced into Singapore, with oral histories and first-hand experiences of survivors of the war.\n351 Upper Bukit Timah Road\nMon-Sat: 9am-5.30pm\nSun: 12pm-5.30pm\nReopening in 2017\n(Featured Image Credits: Sentosa)\nFREE $10 VOUCHER\nRedeem a FREE $10 concert voucher from Hapz when you sign up for our mailing list.\nEmail Address *\nFirst Name\nAlso Read\nWe may be stuck at home, but there are certainly a few things we never knew we would be thankful for during our Circuit Breaker life!\nEach installation explores a topic Singapore youths like us care about, and the more you interact with them, the more they\u2018ll reveal.\nTravel back in time and experience the performing arts on the 50s and 60s at the Chinatown Opera Festival 2019, happening 20 to 24th November.\nOnce we decided together as a family that we wanted to own our own home, we did a lot of homework.\nWe had been living in a rental flat for so long that I did not imagine the possibility of owning my very own home.\nLoad more articles\nDiscover SG brings you up-to-date news on the latest events, local news, festivals, and anything else exciting happening in Singapore.\n"

            "Hiking the Dragon\u2019s Back, Hong Kong\nPreparation\nGetting there - It's easy to get to the Dragon's Back by public transport. Firstly get the MTR to Shau Kei Wan. From here, find the bus station (it's directly outside the exit) and jump on the number 9 bus to Shek O. There's two entries to the Dragon's Back, but we recommend starting at the point on the map below. This way you can add on section 8 of the Hong Kong trail to Big Wave Beach to make the hike longer. Alternatively take a cab from the city, the journey should take around 20 minutes.\nGetting Back\u00a0 - If you're going by public transport there are frequent buses along Shek O road. Look out for the number 9 bus to Shau Kei Wan and then get the MTR.\nThe Trail - The trail is in very good condition and suitable for anyone who can manage several staircases. There are some steepish sections, but this should not put anyone off as they aren't very long.\nThe Track (including section 8 to Big Wave Beach)\n8.11km, 204m elevation, 2 hours 23\nApproximately 5km, 1 hr 25 (including breaks), 204m elevation, track in very good condition.\nDisclaimer: we did this trail the wrong way round! We started at the end and hiked to the start. Then we went back to the end to do section 8 of the Hong Kong Trail (the crazy things you do to complete a track....).\nIf you only want to walk the Dragon's Back trail itself then you can start from either direction. We enjoyed the extra track that made up section 8 of the HK trail but if you are pushed for time, the Dragon's Back is by far the most beautiful part.\nView fullsize\nGoing the wrong way...\nNo matter where you start the trail, the first section is steep! The Shek O Road is a lot lower down than the trail, so the first section is all about getting to the ridge and the trail proper.\nIn the direction we took, the path quickly turned to a shaded track. After the first kilometre, it flattened out pretty quickly and it was an easy walk through lovely forest. There were also vast numbers of stunning blue butterflies.\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nThe Dragon\u2019s Back Trail: Start of the trail\nWe walked past streams and through the forests, feeling a long way from the bustle and crowds of downtown Hong Kong.\nThe whole track is signposted well.\u00a0After a while on the flat path you turn left and the track begins ascending again. Soon the trees clear for one of the best views of Hong Kong.\nThe Dragon's Back\nIt's this part of the trail that demonstrates what I love so much about Hong Kong.\nOnly a couple of kilometres from one of the busiest and most crowded cities in the world, you are stood in a National Park with million dollar views and hardly anyone else around.\n(Disclaimer: we walked this track on a week day, it would not be the same on the weekend).\nView fullsize\nThe Dragon\u2019s Back Trail: Views over the South China Sea\nView fullsize\nThe Dragon\u2019s Back Trail: Hiking to the views\nThe ridge is the main reason people come here: sweeping ocean views that go for miles. You can also see glimpses of the city in the distance and some pretty affluent suburbs below. The landscape by the shore was very manicured with some pretty swanky houses and golf courses.\nYou'll also get glimpses of the beautiful Big Wave Beach and the beaches around Shek O. If you want to stop for some lunch or simply to take in the view, you can rest up on one of the benches up there.\nGoing down again\nSoon the trail starts to go downhill, leading to views south of the island. You carry on for a little while until the trail turns right and the ridge top views disappear and you're back in the forest.\nHalfway down the trail you'll come to a clearing and get a glimpse of some gorgeous blue water and apartment buildings at Red Hill. I can only imagine the kind of views you get if you lived there, mind blowing!\nView fullsize\nView fullsize\nThe Dragon\u2019s Back Trail: Views from the top\nNot long after, the trail ends, (well, for everyone walking stage 8 it would be the start) at Shek O road bus shelter. There's quite a lot of passing traffic, so you'll be able to get a bus quite quickly or a taxi.\nHong Kong Trail Section 8 to Big Wave Beach\nWe added this section on, but as mentioned it isn't nearly as pretty as the Dragon's Back, so this is more for those that want specifically to complete the stage or a bit of extra exercise.\u00a0It starts on the road and soon changes to a concrete path. The views are covered by trees and fairly dense vegetation.\nThe track eventually goes into the forest away from the road. When we visited there was some work being done with pipes being laid by the track which detracted from what was otherwise an improvement to the road. Without this work it would likely be very peaceful and the trees give you great cover from the intense sun. The trail goes fairly steeply downhill but is stepped all the way and it's easy terrain.\nView fullsize\nThe Dragon\u2019s Back Trail: Section 8 of the Hong Kong Trail\nApproximately 4km, 1 hour, primarily downhill and trail in good condition\n\ufeffSoon you reach the bottom and arrive at the small town by Big Wave Beach. There's a couple of places to get a much needed cold drink after hiking in the high humidity. It's a short walk to the road where you can grab a bus back to the MTR.\nOur thoughts\nThe Dragon's Back Trail is a great hike, in fact it must be one of the most beautiful urban walking trails in the world.\u00a0It's a relatively easy going trail and offers views of Hong Kong you won't get anywhere else. On a sunny day, there are few better places to be in Hong Kong.\nAs a visitor with limited time in the city the additional section which allows you to complete stage 8 of the Hong Kong trail is probably not necessary. There are so many more beautiful walks in HK. If you take this section it also means you end up further away from the city.\nHave you hiked in Hong Kong? What were your thoughts on the trails? We'll definitely be back to this city so let us know any recommends in the comments below.\nWhere to stay in Hong Kong\nOur Pick - The Ritz Carlton\nIt\u2019s a big statement, but the Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong is the best hotel we\u2019ve ever stayed in! This five star hotel sets a new bar with incredible service, stunning rooms and an unrivalled location set on the 118th floor of the International Commerce Centre in Kowloon.\nIt costs a lot, but it is a once in a lifetime experience. We loved it so much that we struggled to leave the hotel.\nLike it? Pin it!\nFollow us on social media\nAre you going to Hong Kong soon? Would you go hiking on a city break?

            "About Mount Kinabalu\nMount Kinabalu\u2019s specialty lies in its location at a renowned World Heritage Site\u2014Kinabalu Park.\n                        Nature lovers will be delighted to be able to witness the many variations of flora and fauna\n                        that are to be found on the mountain at different altitudes.\nMount Kinabalu, along with other upland areas of the Crocker Range is well-known worldwide for\n                        its tremendous botanical and biological species biodiversity with plants of Himalayan,\n                        Australasian, and Indo-Malayan origin.\nA recent botanical survey of the mountain estimated a staggering 5,000 to 6,000 plant species\n                        (excluding mosses and liverworts but including ferns), which is more than all of Europe and\n                        North America (excluding tropical regions of Mexico) combined. It is therefore one of the\n                        world\u2019s most important biological sites.\nStanding majestically at 4,095m (13,435 feet above sea level), Mount Kinabalu is the highest mountain between the Himalayas and New Guinea. Mount Kinabalu derives its name from the Kadazan word, \u2018Aki Nabalu\u2019, meaning \u2018the revered place of the dead\u2019. It is one of the safest and most conquerable peaks in the world\u2014provided that you\u2019re reasonably healthy and physically fit.\nThe Summit of Borneo\nMount Kinabalu (Gunung Kinabalu) is the most dramatic feature in Sabah and the tallest peak between the Himalayas & the New Guinea. Towering at 4,095 metres (13,435 feet), Mount Kinabalu exerts a magical quality that is both indescribable and unbelievable. The granite peaks are constantly veiled in wisps of clouds and at times during a clear day, the summit reveals a distinct glacier carved pinnacles, rising from the smooth granite dome. It is one of the safest and most conquerable peaks in the world\u2014provided that you\u2019re reasonably healthy and physically fit.\nLegends & Myths \u2013 Mt Kinabalu Tale\nThough young, it is the central focus of Kinabalu Park and the legends of the KadazanDusun people, Sabah\u2019s largest ethnic group. The KadazanDunsun believe that the mountain is the sacred resting ground of the spirits of their ancestors. Mount Kinabalu derives its name from the Kadazan word, \u2018Aki Nabalu\u2019, meaning \u2018the revered place of the dead\u2019. There are many folklores and fables that tell stories of how Kinabalu got its name.\nThe mysterious KadazanDusun tribe believes that spirits dwell on the mountain top. According to another popular folklore, the name Kinabalu actually meant \u201cCina Balu\u201d. \u201cCina Balu\u201d translates into \u201cchinese widow\u201d. Legend tells a story of a Chinese prince who ascends from the mountain in search of a huge pearl guarded by a ferocious dragon. He married a Kadazan woman upon his successful conquest, whom he soon abandoned for return to China. His heartbroken wife wandered into the mountains to mourn whereby eventually she turned into stone.\nClimbing Mount Kinabalu\nThe highest point of the mountain (Low's Peak) can be accessed relatively easily by any person with reasonable fitness, and required no technical climbing. It is a 8.8km trek to the top where the trail runs along the southern side of the mountain over the Tenompok ridge. Most climbers will take two days to climb up and down Mount Kinabalu with an overnight stay at the huts in Panalaban.\nBefore June 2015, climbers can choose from two available trails to climb Mount Kinabalu \u2013 the Summit trail (via Timpohon Gate) and the Mesilau trail (via Mesilau Gate). However since the 2015 earthquake, the Mesilau trail has since closed and two new trails have been constructed by  Sabah Parks, mountain guides and local villagers to replace the old Summit trail. Part of the old Summit trail was destoryed during the earthquake and had remained inaccessible.\nThere are two trails to the peak, Ranau and Kota Belud trails. To see the difference, please click here . The new Ranau Trail (1.27 km) was opened to the public on 1st December 2015, followed by the more challenging Kota Belud Trail (1.1 km), which was opened a year later on 9th December 2016. Climbers are only allowed to climb up and down Mount Kinabalu via Timpohon Gate and ascend the peak using one of the two new trails; Ranau Tail, located east of the old trail and Kota Belud Trail, to the west. Both trails will meet at Sayat Sayat. This Ranau trail is now the standard \"tourist-friendly\" trail leading to the summit from Panalaban as it is relatively easier and safer because the path is less steep and mostly made of wooden staircases and manageable rock steps.\nThe route to the Mount Kinabalu Summit starts from the Timpohon Gate (1,866m; 6,122 ft) which is located near the Kinabalu Park Headquarters. Climbers will take the minibus to the Timpohon Gate and their ascent commence at about 9 a.m. in the morning. All climbers must be accompanied by mountain guides at all times.\nBefore reaching Panalaban (3,273m; 10,738 ft) where all the huts that provide rooms, food and hot beverages are located, climbers will encounter a series of trail shelters (pondok)\u2014 the first shelter, Pondok Kandis (1,981m; 6,499 ft), and the second shelter, Pondok Ubah (2,081m; 6,827 ft). The forest becomes thicker and mosses and ferns become abundant. After 30 minutes, the third shelter, Pondok Lowii (2,267m; 7,500 ft) is reached.\nSoon after, the trail splits with one leading to telecom towers and the main trail to the summit continues on the right. After Pondok Mempening (2516m; 8251 ft), the fouth shelter, the trail soon leads to an open exposed area at Layang-Layang (2,702m; 8,865 ft) where there is a small mountain rescue hut located here. Climbers will notice an abundance of pitcher plants. After about 45 minutes, Pondok Villosa (2,961m, 9,714 ft), situtated atop an open rocky patch will be reached and a small track leads to a helipad at 3,052 m.\nThe forest has changed from stunted ultramafic vegetation to sub-alphine plants, taller trees and granite boulders after the helipad junction. Pondok Paka (3,080m; 10,105 ft) named after the nearby Paka Cave is reached within a few minutes. The Paka Cave is not a cave, but rather, a overhanging granite boulder which acted as a resting stop for earlier explorers.\nNot far away, another 500 m, climbers will arrive at Panalaban, where Laban Rata Resthouse is located. Climbers will register and check in to their assigned rooms. Nearby huts include unheated Gunting Lagadan, Lemaing Hut, Mokodou, Kinotoki and Pendant Hut (for Mountain Torq's via Ferrata climbers) and huts for Sabah Parks. The climb from Timpohon Gate to Panalaban takes approximately 4 to 6 hours. Along the trail, be sure to keep your eyes open for the plenteous interesting sights to check out such as the Villosa pitcher plant as well as a view of the Carson miniature waterfall.\nUpon arriving at Panalaban, climbers will have some time to rest and recharge their energy. The climb to the summit resumes before dawn, normally between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. the next morning. In the dark, the climb goes over some steep sections with wooden stairs in sub-alphine forest. The climb to reach the summit requires climbers to hold onto an affixed rope. Therefore, climbers are advised to wear thick woven gloves in order to ward off the cold as well as to prevent their palms from getting cuts. Climbing up the rock slopes on the side of the Panar Rock Face quickly leads to the Sayat Sayat huts (3,668m, 12,034 ft).\nHere climbers are checked for security to account for the number of people ascending and descending the summit. Due to effects of the high altitude, climbers may find it difficult to breathe and move slowly as the air thins out. There is a white rope attached to the rock section on the summit plateau. It's function is to guide, orientate and assist climbers to the summit in the dark or dense fog.\nFinal part of the ascent requires climbers to  scamble over loose rocks and large boulders for about 90 m before reaching Low's Peak. The climb from Panalaban to the summit normally takes about 3 to 4 hours for most people, just in time to catch the sunrise.\nAfter the victorious moment of summiting Low's Peak, and snapping away photographs as momento, climbers make a quick descent back to their huts in Panalaban for a quick breakfast, before heading down to Timpohon Gate. The remaining descent takes about another 3 to 6 hours depending on the fitness and physical condition of the climbers.\nThe descent could be quite rapid for some but tough on the knees, and climbers must be mindful that the route can be slippery, because often the rain sets in during the late morning. Look out for the extremely rare and endemic Kinabalu Leech and its prey, the Kinablau Blue Worm, which will emerge from the soil when it pours.\nAnother exciting way to conquer Mount Kinabalu is through the Mountain Torq Via Ferrata trail. To visit other peaks at Mount Kinabalu, other than Low's Peak, climbers require rock climbing and professional equipment.\nRelated Info\nManaged by: Amazing Borneo Tours & Events Sdn Bhd\nL1.37, 1st Floor, Kompleks Asia City, Jalan Asia City, 88000 Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia.\nOffice Tel: (+6) 088-448-709\n"

            "Photograph by Babak Tafreshi, Nat Geo Image Collection\nRead Caption\nThe northern lights stream down above Kirkjufell mountain in Iceland\u2019s Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula.\nPhotograph by Babak Tafreshi, Nat Geo Image Collection\n7 Magical Places to View Auroras\nThese tips will give you the best shot at experiencing the enchantment of the northern and southern lights.\n4 Minute Read\nThe otherworldly aurora borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\u2014at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles\u2014when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.\nThe first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accessible places if you\u2019d like to take in these light shows yourself.\nFor the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55\u00b0 and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here .\nIn the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here , or by using a sky guide app.\nAnd remember: Besides weather, a dark sky and the right season are the keys. Try moonless nights.\nIceland\nEven without the northern lights, Iceland is an otherworldly place to visit, with glaciers, geysers, massive waterfalls, and volcanoes. Both the latitude and longitude of the country favor aurora viewing, but the weather doesn\u2019t always cooperate. However, a good coastline road around the country lets you chase clear skies.\nI have seen my best auroras from Kirkjufell mountain on the west coast. In high activity you can even spy the northern lights from the suburbs of Reykjav\u00edk; the Grotta Lighthouse is a popular viewing spot.\nAcross the country, sky watchers can take in the dancing lights from outdoor hot tubs, inside Buubble lodges, and from hot spring lagoons.\nWhen to Go: Late August to early April\nRelated: Stunning Time-lapse Video of Iceland's Northern Lights\nFairbanks, Alaska\nView Images\nIn Fairbanks, Alaska, the sky glows with the aurora borealis.\nPhotogrpah by Accent Alaska.com/Alamy\nLocated just two degrees below the Arctic near international airport and close to the impressive Denali National Park , Fairbanks is the best place in the U.S. to take in the northern lights. It even has its own forecast system and offers tours to take visitors far from city lights.\nWhen to Go: Late August to mid-April\nYellowknife, Canada\nView Images\nThe aurora borealis spreads out above Prosperous Lake in Yellowknife, Canada.\nPhotograph by Don Johnston_NC/Alamy\nThis Northwest Territories capital on the shores of Great Slave Lake boasts its own Aurora Village and special activities for northern lights tourism.\nCanada is an aurora viewing paradise, thanks to its northern latitude and low light pollution; elsewhere in the country, Wood Buffalo and Jasper National Park are popular viewing spots.\nWhen to Go: Mid-August to late April. For Churchill and Wood Buffalo, early August to early May.\nTroms\u00f8, Norway\nView Images\nA fjord reflects the glowing green light of an aurora near Troms\u00f8, Norway.\nPhotograph by Babak Tafreshi, Nat Geo Image Collection\nThe largest urban area in northern Norway is 217 miles north of the Arctic Circle, but thanks to the Gulf Stream the coastline has surprisingly moderate temperatures. It also has beautiful scenery, magnificent fjords, and the Lyngen Alps .\nI have seen spectacular auroras from the village of Ersfjordbotn, 12 miles from Troms\u00f8. Other popular locations in the country are the Lofoten Islands and the far northern towns of Alta, Nordkapp, and Kirkenes.\nWhen to Go: Mid-September to late March\nNorthern Sweden and Finland\nView Images\nThe northern lights swirl over a wooded area in northern Sweden.\nPhotograph by Babak Tafreshi, Nat Geo Image Collection\nSweden\u2019s northernmost town of Kiruna is a gateway for nearby attractions. There is the ICEHOTEL, mountainous Abisko National Park , the local Sami culture , and plentiful reindeer. A short drive from the town takes you to a good spot for aurora viewing. The weather here is much more stable than the Norwegian coast, but it\u2019s colder too.\nIn Finland\u2019s Lapland region, Rovaniemi serves as a gateway town to nearby national parks \u2014where in winter you can spot frozen snow-covered trees called Tykky sculptures along with the northern lights.\nWhen to Go: Mid-September to late March\nGreenland\nView Images\nClouds partially obscure an aurora above an iceberg in northeastern Greenland.\nPhotograph by Richard McManus, Getty Images\nIt\u2019s possible to be too far north to see the northern lights\u2014such is the case in northern Greenland . But head farther south for beautiful auroras and attractions like Qaleraliq Glacier , which has small floating icebergs even in summer.\nWhen to Go: Mid-August to late April in the south and late August to mid-April in Nuuk.\nTasmania and New Zealand\nPhotograph by Yuichi Takasaka\nYou hear about northern lights more often than southern lights (aurora australis) because there are fewer locations to see auroras from the Southern Hemisphere. Your best chance is on the southern tip of both Tasmania ( Australia ) and New Zealand , where a dark sky will help you see any active auroras over the southern horizon. These are the closest accessible places to the south magnetic pole, outside of Antarctica.\nWhen to Go: Year round, but your best chances are near equinoxes.\nBabak Tafreshi is a photographer and the founder of The World at Night (TWAN) photography program.

            "by Jasmine Alley\nYou\u2019re in luck!\nSingapore is one of the most modern countries I have ever visited.\nAs a result, it\u2019s no surprise that they are with the times in terms of their Instagrammable locations.\nI\u2019ve spent five months in Singapore over the past few years since I have family there, and feel like I\u2019ve gotten a pretty good handle on the prettiest, most Instagram worthy places in Singapore.\nSome Singapore Instagram spots are trickier than others to find, so under each location, I share tips and what you should expect!\nWithout further ado, here are the 40 most Instagrammable places in Singapore!\nTable of Contents\nMap of the most Instagrammable places in Singapore\nHere\u2019s a map of all forty locations so that you can plan the spots you want to visit according to location.\nThe map is color coded as follows:\nBlue: Downtown Singapore\nPurple: Colorful buildings\n1. Marina Bay Sands\nMarina Bay Sands is a pretty iconic spot in Singapore.\nThis boat-shaped hotel boats an infinity pool with incredible views of the city, but it\u2019ll cost you a pretty penny if you want to spend the night.\nGood news for us photographers- this Singapore Instagram spot is completely free to access.\nIt\u2019s located in Gardens by the Bay in the northwestern corner of Dragonfly Lake. I\u2019ve market the exact location on the map with a pin!\n2. Gardens by the Bay\nGardens by the Bay is definitely one of the most Instagrammable places in Singapore!\nThere are a ton of great viewpoints for getting the Avatar-esque Supertrees in a photo.\nMy recommendation is to go an hour or two before sunset to find your favorite angle of the trees and plan your shot.\nAt dusk, the trees light up and then you can get a neat shot like this one.\n(If you go during the day when they\u2019re not lit up, they are still pretty and interesting, but they are a plain green color with a bit of purple.)\nBest of all, make sure you stay long enough for the Garden Rhapsody, which happens twice a night at 7:45 and 8:45pm daily (as of December 2019).\nAccess to Gardens by the Bay is free, but you can choose to purchase tickets to enter other areas of the park.\n3. Cloud Forest\nJan 31, 2018 at 3:32am PST\nNov 20, 2018 at 8:02pm PST\nThe Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay features one of two remarkable waterfalls in Singapore (the other is a bit further down on this list!).\nUnfortunately, this feature does come with a bit of a price tag.\nUnless you are a Singaporean resident or a child under 12, you\u2019ll shell out $28 SGD per person to enter the Cloud Forest.\n4. Water Lily Pond Viewpoint\nThis is by far my favorite viewpoint for Marina Bay Sands and the Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay.\nThis rock is located in the Water Lily Pond at Gardens by the Bay, and there actually are no signs saying you can\u2019t sit on it as of December 2019!\n(If things change in 2020, you can still get a very similar shot from the shoreline, which you can see at the bottom of this photo.)\nTo get to the rock, I actually took one step in this very shallow pond, and then hopped back from the rock to shore.\nThe exact location is marked on the map!\n5. Singapore Flier\nAs you walk from Gardens by the Bay along the Marina Bay waterfront sidewalk towards Marina Bay Sands, you\u2019ll get this view of the Singapore Flyer.\nIf you want to actually go up the Flyer, you\u2019ll get views from 42 stories up, and on a clear day you\u2019ll see Malaysia and even Indonesia! The cost is $33 SGD for adults.\nColorful Instagrammable Places in Singapore\n6. Peranakan Houses\nThese colorful houses are becoming more and more popular on Instagram, so there might be other people taking photos here when you visit.\nHowever, the street has multiple houses on both sides of the street, so chances are there will be a spot where you can get a photo without anyone in it.\nCan you imagine living in one of these houses? I\u2019m curious to see who bought the pink one that was for sale (as you can see in this photo!).\n7. Arab Street\nArab Street is colorful, vibrant, and beautiful- three things that make it one of my favorite Instagrammable places in Singapore!\nAnother great thing about this colorful street is that there are no cars driving down or parked along the side of the road.\nThat means that as long as you\u2019re okay with having people behind you in a photo, you can come here any any time of day for an Insta-worthy photo of Arab Street!\nBe sure to stop into the trendy shops along Arab Street- there were a lot of dresses and woven purses that caught my eye!\n8. Rochor Center\nOct 29, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT\nMar 8, 2017 at 3:22am PST\nAnother colorful part of Singapore is the country\u2019s HDB housing. The ones that comprise Rochor Center are definitely the most colorful of them all!\nHDB housing is how the majority of locals live in Singapore- the government has done a great job at making sure its people have great places to live.\nThese are some of the more Instagrammable places in Singapore, but as you explore Singapore you\u2019ll notice that most of the HDB housing is colorful!\n9. Colorful House of Tan Teng Niah\nIf you want a real pop of color on your Instagram feed, look no further than the House of Tan Teng Niah.\nThis is a very short walk from the Little India MRT station.\nThere are different angles to capture photos here, as well as other colorful buildings nearby, so be sure to explore the area to find the shot you want!\n10. Selegie Arts Center\nSep 23, 2019 at 10:55pm PDT\nWhat the Selegie Arts Center looked like before it was painted. Photo credit: Choo Yut Shing\nYou can really tell how this country is stepping up its Instagram game when looking at the before and after photos of the Selegie Arts Center!\nIt used to be all yellow and indigo, but now it practically screams \u201ctake a pic with me!\u201d with its colorful facade!\nAs of December 2019, this spot hasn\u2019t been over-photographed on Instagram, but that might change as people catch on that this is one of the most Instagrammable places in Singapore!\nUntil then, enjoy capturing a photo here with not too many people around! And if you visit and it has become a popular Singapore Instagram spot, please return to this post and comment to let me know!\n11. Old Hill Street Police Station\nThis is one of two spots that I\u2019ve noticed a LOT of people wanting to get a photo of.\nFortunately, the building is huge and the sidewalk across from it is long enough so that you don\u2019t have to wait your turn to get a photo (so far).\nWhen I visited on a Sunday afternoon after church, there were at least five groups of people (not including my dad and me!) trying to get a shot here!\nThe trouble is, you do need patience to get a shot without cars.\nEvery two to three minutes, due to the changing signals, there is about a 10 second pause where no cars will be driving by!\nSo it doesn\u2019t really matter what time of day you visit this spot, just be patient to find your opening and then get the shot as quickly as you can!\n12. Clarke Quay\nClarke Quay is a popular expat spot in Singapore, known for its bars and great location.\nIt also is a great spot for photos because it is full of color!\nThis is the kind of area you\u2019ll want to walk around and explore in order to find the shot you want.\nIt is right by the Old Hill Police Station (listed right before this), so you can easily get photos in both at the same time!\n13. Chinatown Bridge\nIf you take the MRT to Chinatown, this bridge is right on top of it at the intersection of New Bridge Road and Pagoda Street.\nOnce you\u2019re on the bridge, this spot is facing the Pagoda Street side, and is right next to a reflexology stone pathway in the ground.\n14. Redhill MRT Station\nDec 10, 2019 at 10:33am PST\nJun 29, 2018 at 1:27am PDT\nThis MRT station is PINK.\nI think that is all there is to say about that! \ud83d\ude42\nInstagrammable parks and nature in Singapore\n15. Japanese Cemetery Park\nThis spot requires a car or bus to get to, unless you want to walk 1.3 km/.8 miles from the closest MRT stop (Kovan MRT station).\nNot many people come to this one so it\u2019s actually nice to walk around and enjoy the pink blooms here!\nAlso, I hope this goes without saying, but please be sure to show respect as it is a cemetery.\n16. MacRitchie Treetop Walk\nPhoto credit: Scott Dexter\nIf you\u2019re up for some exercise, pack a few bottles of water and head to the MacRitchie Treetop Walk!\nAlso, give yourself at least 3 hours to complete a round trip hike. (You do have the option to just walk one way).\nYou do have to enter the bridge from the entrance on Pierce track from the ranger station since it is a one-direction bridge.\nPlease note that the park is closed on Mondays (except on public holidays) and has strict hours:\nTuesday-Friday: 9-5PM\n17. Singapore Botanic Garden\nThe Singapore Botanic Garden is free to enter and is actually a UNESCO World Heritage site!\nSo naturally, it\u2019s a must see on my list of Instagrammable places in Singapore.\nThis garden is the only tropical garden on the UNESCO list, and is over 160 years old!\nSpanning 203 acres, there are plenty of good photo opportunities here. It\u2019s also open from 5am to midnight, so you can visit at almost any time.\n18. National Orchid Garden\nLocated within the Singapore Botanic Garden, the National Orchid Garden has a $5 SGD entrance fee for adults and is definitely worth it to see!\nWith over 1000 species of orchids (and 2000 hybrids!) on display, it is one of the prettiest gardens I\u2019ve explored (so naturally, it makes my list of Singapore Instagram spots)!\nThe iconic Instagram shot here is the green archways, which are located very close to the entrance on the path to the right.\nThere are also elaborate, giant bird cages that are very photogenic, as well as little fountains and plenty of flowers to get photos of.\nWhile the Botanic Garden has very generous hours, note that the National Orchid Garden has shorter hours from 8:30am-7pm and ticket sales close at 6pm.\nThe closest entrance to the Singapore Botanic Garden to get to the National Orchid Garden is the northern Tyersall Gallop entrance.\n19. Swan Lake Gazebo\nThis pretty gazebo reminds me of something out of a fairy tale!\nLocated at the very edge of Swan Lake, you an access this gazebo easily from the southwest Tanglin Gate.\nOther than your \u2018normal\u2019 wildlife, there are chickens that roam around this area, as well as the occasional monitor lizard (up to 3 meters long!) that will walk on land and swim in this lake.\nI really loved the shots I got here which is why it\u2019s one of my favorite Instagrammable places in Singapore.\n20. Sang Nila Utama Garden\nThis garden is located in Fort Canning Park, close to the Clarke Quay entrance.\nIt was created as one of nine different gardens that are meant to draw you into Singapore\u2019s history.\nWhen you walk through the Sang Nila Utama Garden, you\u2019ll actually get a taste for what Fort Canning may have looked like in 14th century Singapore.\nBesides these pretty Japanese split gates, you\u2019ll find reflective pools, plenty of symmetry, and statues- all of which were believed to be in prince Sang Nila Utama\u2019s garden at the time.\n21. Merlion Park\nThe Merlion is a Singaporen icon that is half fish, half lion; fish for its humble fishing village beginnings, and lion for the Malay name for Singapore- \u201clion city\u201d.\nHead to Merlion Park to not only get a shot with the Merlion, but also to get a great view of Marina Bay Sands or the Singaporean cityscape.\n22. Sentosa Bridge\nLocated on Sentosa Island, this bridge takes you to the southernmost point in Southeast Asia.\nSince it is a one lane bridge, you will probably have to be a bit patient trying to get a photo here!\nBut I love bridge photos so I wanted this to be on my list of Instagrammable places in Singapore!\n23. Chinese Garden\nPhoto credit: Allie_Caulfield\nThe Chinese Garden is connected to the Japanese Garden, and both are Singapore Instagram spots for photos.\nYou\u2019ll find bridges, ponds, and this gorgeous pagoda among other things.\nInstagrammable temples in Singapore\nThis goes without saying (hopefully), but it is of the utmost importance that we all show respect and do not get in the way when we visit temples and places of worship.\nAlso, you\u2019ll need to be properly dressed to enter these temples, and you can borrow a scarf if you need something to cover your shoulders!\n24. Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple\nThe front of the Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple is really stunning, but the day that I visited it was blocked by tables.\nInstead, I went around back to get a fun close-up shot with the detailed carvings in the background!\n25. Masjid Sultan\nThis is a preserved mosque from 1824- and it really is beautiful!\nThere are a few angles that I can think of for a photo with Masjid Sultan; if you want it close up, this is the best you\u2019ll probably get. I shot this with a 24mm lens.\nIf you wanted a head-on, symmetrical shot of the mosque, you\u2019ll need a much wider lens, since the shops across from it prevent you from adding depth.\nAlternatively, you can get a far away shot framed with an archway not too far from here.\n26. Sri Krishnan Temple\nThis Hindu temple- originally built in 1870- is quite stunning with its detailed carvings and vibrant colors!\nIt is located on Waterloo Street, and the closest MRT stop is Bugis.\nThe space right in front of the temple is a large pedestrain area paved with brick, so if you want a shot right in front, it is definitely doable.\nIf you want a shot without others in it, either head to this area early in the day or wait and have patience!\n27. Sri Mariamman Temple\nThe Sri Mariamman Temple is located in Chinatown and is the city\u2019s oldest Hindu Temple! It was built in 1827 and features an elaborate tower that you can\u2019t miss.\nThere is a road directly in front of the temple and occasionally cars are parked on it, so you might need to get creative with angles here.\nAnd again, in case you missed it earlier, I just want to emphasize the importance of being respectful when visiting these temples.\n28. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple\nYou\u2019ll find this temple in the heart of Chinatown, so unless you visit very early in the morning, it will probably be very difficult to get a shot without anyone in it.\nThis temple is designed in the Tang dynasty style and is really beautiful from all sides, so I recommend walking around it first to find your favorite camera angle!\nInstagrammable architecture in Singapore\n29. Changi Jewel Vortex \u2013 My favorite Singapore Instagram Spot!\nThe Rain Vortex is one of my favorite Instagrammable places in Singapore because it sums up how I see the country: modern and green with incredible architecture and easy transportation.\nThis waterfall is the largest indoor waterfall in the world (40 meters or 131 feet high), and is located inside Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport.\nThough this is an easy photo to take when you are arriving or departing Singapore and are already at the airport, you can come anytime.\nYou do not need to have a boarding pass to visit the Jewel Changi Airport, which houses the Rain Vortex.\nIt is also free to visit, though many of the other attractions at the Jewel do have entrance fees.\nAlso, note that the water starts pouring out at 8:00 AM and then pours continuously all day until after 11:30PM.\nAt night time there are gorgeous colorful lights illuminating the waterfall. With a combination of the lights and music, it truly feels magical being there!\n30. Orchard Road\nOrchard Road is known for its great (albeit expensive) shopping, but I like it for its energy and architecture!\nIf you are a fashion blogger and want a shot in front of a famous designer store, you\u2019ll probably find it here.\nIf you just are looking for neat architecture, the building behind me in this photo is a classic take on modern Singaporean style.\nThis photo was taken on the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road, where you can see the funky Dolce & Gabbana/Tiffany\u2019s/Cartier building on the opposite square in the background.\n31. Library@Orchard\nNov 18, 2019 at 8:16am PST\nDec 4, 2019 at 3:22am PST\nFor more interesting architecture around Orchard Road, stop into the Library@Orchard.\nAmong the rows of curvy bookcases, you can get a neat shot perusing the books.\n32. Fort Canning Staircase\nThe Fort Canning underground crossing is truly a beauty! It is located at the northern tip of Fort Canning Park (exact location is shown on the map).\nLogistically, getting this shot takes a bit of patience.\nFor one, you have pedestrians constantly going up and down the stairs, so you have to wait for a break in the commotion.\nAnd for another, you might be in a line of people waiting to get this shot!!\nWhen I went, we also had to deal with a third issue- the rain!\nWe probably spent over 30 minutes in this tunnel waiting for the rain to stop so that we could grab this shot, but I\u2019m glad we did because it is such a neat place!\nBecause I worked so hard for this shot and love the way it turned out, I just had to add it to my list of Instagrammable places in Singapore!\n33. Chijmes\nYou might recognize this place from the movie Crazy Rich Asians; this is where the crazy rich wedding is!\nChijmes began as a Catholic convent, but is now a popular wedding venue, event space, and dining area.\nDesigned in the Neo-classical style, you\u2019ll be able to get a few beautiful angles as you walk around Chijmes.\n34. Raffles Hotel\nHome to the original Singapore Sling, Raffles Hotel is an elegant 5-star hotel that was built in 1887.\nMy favorite Instagram shot of this place is one directly in front, where you can see the gorgeous Colonial architecture, but there are plenty of other photo angles inside.\nThe symmetry and design continues as you move from outside to inside, with mirrored staircases, traditional-styled seating areas, and beautiful chandeliers throughout.\nAnd if you\u2019re thinking about splurging for a night here, I think it\u2019s worth it! The rooftop pool is stunning, as are the rooms, balconies, hallways, and basically everything else at this hotel.\nAlso, be sure to stop into the Long Bar to try the original Singapore Sling!\n35. ArtScience Museum\nThe ArtScience Museum is located at Marina Bay Sands, and weaves together art and science in a beautiful way.\nThis photo depicts the most popular Instagram spot in the ArtScience Museum, which is in the \u201cFuture World: Where Art meets Science\u201d exhibit.\nAdult tickets start at $19, but there are a lot of add-ons depending on if you want to see more than one exhibit, if you\u2019re with a group, if you\u2019re a student, etc.\nYou can see ticket prices and buy your tickets here .\n36. Pagoda Street Stairs\n\u201cHistorical\u201d Chinese architecture meets modern aesthetics at the stairs on Pagoda Street.\nThis is my favorite view of Pagoda Street, since you get a mix of different colors and architecture.\nThe easiest way to access this point is to exit the Chinatown MRT station at Pagoda Street, then turn around and walk up the stairs to the bridge that crosses over New Bridge Road.\n37. Potato Head\nNov 5, 2019 at 6:17am PST\nSep 26, 2019 at 4:07am PDT\nThis is a fun building for a photo because of:\nThe cute name (cue all the \u201cpotato head\u201d captions)\nPretty colors\nFun architecture\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling hungry, you can stop into Potato Head for a burger and a cocktail. It is a cocktail bar, burger joint, and a speakeasy all in one!\n38. Sentosa Merlion\nFor a close up shot of the famous Singapore Merlion, visit the Merlion at Imbiah Station in Sentosa.\nInstagrammable islands around Singapore\n39. St. John\u2019s & Kusu Islands\nSt. John Island. Photo credit: Budak\nSt. John\u2019s and Kusu Islands are islands right next to each other on Singapore\u2019s southern shores.\nHere you\u2019ll find the best beaches in Singapore (because let\u2019s be honest, Sentosa\u2019s beaches are not that great), some neat architecture on Kusu (including turtle sculptures, since Kusu is named after the sea turtle!), and great picnic and swim areas.\nThe entrance to Kusu Island. Photo credit: Mark\u7231\u751f\u6d3b\nTo get there, you\u2019ll pay $18 round trip (per adult) at the ferry at Marina South Pier, and embark on a 30 minute boat ride.\nThere are multiple ferry services, but all should have stops on both St John\u2019s and Kusu, so you can head to St. John\u2019s for the first part of the day and Kusu for the next.\nNote that the ferries do not go from Kusu to St. Johns!\nHere are two ferry schedules:\n39.5 Raffles Lighthouse\nWhy the ranking of 39 and a half?\nAlthough this certainly is an Instagram worthy place in Singapore, chances are you won\u2019t actually be able to visit this if you\u2019re visiting the country for a short time.\nRaffles Lighthouse is the hardest photo location to get to in Singapore, since it is located on Palau Satumu, an island in the Singapore Straights, and since you can only visit during certain times of the year.\nIt requires a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority and a ferry ride that is about an hour, which leaves from the Marina South Pier.\n40. Palau Ubin\nPalau Ubin is an island off of Singapore\u2019s northeastern coast.\nOn Palau Ubin, you\u2019ll get to experience what Singapore was like way back when: dirt roads, kampongs, tropical green forests.\nIf you visit in the months around June, you\u2019ll see durians growing in the trees!\nOnly a fifteen minute boat ride away, it is a bit easier to access from the main island than St. John\u2019s and Kusu Islands.\nThis ferry ride only costs $2 per person and departs from the Changi Point Jetty.\nAt Changi Point, you\u2019ll wait at the designated Palau Ubin jetty stop until there are twelve people; the ferry only leaves when it is full.\n(If you don\u2019t have the patience for other people to arrive, you can also pay the full cost for 12 passengers and charter a ride that way).\nWhen you get there, the first thing to do is rent a bike. There are a bunch of different bike rental options as soon as you leave the main jetty.\nOnce you have your bike, you\u2019re free to roam around the island!\nJust watch out for monkeys and wild pigs! The pigs won\u2019t approach you, but the monkeys might, so hold on to your stuff!\nWhile on Palau Ubin, visit the Chek Jawa Wetlands\nThis is my favorite part of the island; usually we bike here first to make sure we have enough time to explore the wetlands.\nHere you\u2019ll find a mangrove forest, a boardwalk that takes you out over the water, and plenty of lush greenery.\nIn conclusion\u2026\nI hope you can see just how Instagrammable Singapore is!\nFrom colorful buildings and neat architecture to pristine parks and island getaways, this little country has them all.\nIf you think of some Singapore Instagram spots that I haven\u2019t mentioned, please comment them below!\nI\u2019d love to check them out on my next visit to Singapore!\nSafe travels!\nShop the post\nPS.

            "March 5, 2018\niStock.com/martin-dm\nLandmarks are landmarks for a reason. While they can often draw tourists in such large numbers that restaurants start to take advantage of it , areas get crowded, and locals get annoyed , they\u2019re still spots that are worthy of consideration for the thoughtful traveler. Europe, with its centuries of rulers, wars, artwork, and more, as well as the wealth and opulence that came with colonial power, has more than its fair share of landmarks that are recognized not just in their native nations but around the world, and we\u2019ve created a list of the ones you need to make sure you see.\nWith its many dynasties, past and present, Europe\u2019s landmarks are often dominated by castles and palaces. Thanks to a strong Christian history, opulent churches have a strong presence on this list, but so do ancient pagan temples and one cathedral that was originally built as a mosque. France seems to have a bit of an edge over other European countries, with six landmarks on the list, four of which are in Paris . Spain follows with five landmarks spread out in five different cities. Moscow may be the official capital of Russia , but St. Petersburg seems to be its cultural capital, with three of the country\u2019s four spots on this list. Italy , of course, also has a strong showing with four sites, not counting the two that are located in Vatican City. There are plenty of other landmarks throughout the rest of Europe that are worthy of note, however, and cities like Lisbon, Vienna, Kiev\u00a0and Valletta have just as much to offer both in terms of education and scenery. So if you\u2019re planning a trip to the Old Continent, check out this list of 35 European landmarks you need to visit.\nAlhambra (Granada)\niStock.com/alxpin\nThe Alhambra is a testament to the cultural and architectural legacy left behind by the Arab Muslim rulers of Spain. Built in the mid-thirteenth century, the palace and fortress complex shows off the finest of arabesque and Islamic art and architecture. Tickets can sell out pretty quick, as the Alhambra brings in about 6,000 visitors every day, so make sure to book ahead and get there as soon as you\u2019re done with your delicious Granada breakfast .\nApostolic Palace (Vatican City)\niStock.com/senorcampesino\nSeeing the Sistine Chapel may be a bit of a clich\u00e9 for travelers to Rome, but it\u2019s more than worth a trip to the Apostolic Palace , the official residence of the Pope. Also known as the Papal Palace, this stunning structure not only contains the offices of the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church, but it\u2019s also home to the Vatican Library and Vatican Museums, which contain 54 galleries of some of the world\u2019s great works of Western art by legends such as Da Vinci, Raphael, and Caravaggio.\nArc de Triomphe (Paris)\niStock.com/matthewleesdixon\nParis has many famous monuments, and one if its top landmarks is the Arc de Triomphe de l\u2019\u00c9toile (French for \u201cTriumphal Arch of the Star,\u201d better known as the Arc de Triomphe. Located at the western end of the famous Parisian avenue, Champs-\u00c9lyse\u00e9s, it stands as a monument for the soldiers who were killed in both the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. You can see all the names of the French victories and generals from these conflicts on the surfaces of the arch, and France\u2019s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I also lies beneath its vault.\nBel\u00e9m Tower (Lisbon)\niStock.com/SeanPavonePhoto\nOfficially named the Tower of Saint Vincent, Bel\u00e9m Tower is located in Portugal\u2019s capital city of Lisbon in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m. It was built in the early sixteenth century as a gateway to the city and defense tower by King John II, and continues to be one of many architectural wonders that are helping put Portugal on the map as one of the hottest tourist destinations .\nBrandenburg Gate (Berlin)\niStock.com/Leonardo Patrizi\nBerlin \u2019s iconic Brandenburg Gate was built in the eighteenth century in celebration of the restoration of order during the early Batavian Revolution, and it has stood the test of time through Germany\u2019s eventful history. Damaged during World War II, the East Berlin and West Berlin governments restored it in a joint effort, and the gate went on to symbolize their unification after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.

So leave the car at home, hop on a bicycle\u00a0and explore these cycling trails in and around the city. Don't worry, we've included plenty of leisure beginner-friendly options (with a good view to boot), intense mountain biking tracks and everything else in-between to suit all abilities.\nStart at Seletar Club Rd\nHop on your bicycle and whizz through the new 60-kilometre Rower\u2019s Bay. It\u2019s part of the first phase of the Round Island Route, a continuous 150-kilometre park connector that circles the island. Connecting Yishun to Punggol, the boardwalk allows you to see the city in the dark (for those late-night cycling) with the breeze in your hair as you zoom by the edge of Seletar Reservoir. There\u2019s also a lookout pavilion, swales and a wetland area for you to soak in all of mother nature during the day.

If you\u2019re feeling ambitious, this challenging trek can be conquered in less than a day\u00a0by bicycle\u00a0starting from Jurong Lake Gardens. Though the whole route utilises park connectors, it\u2019s not all greenery and foliage. There are times where you have to get off your bike and walk by busy roads and through estates. Still, the trail covers some of the best parks and nature reserves in Singapore like Bukit Batok Nature Park\u00a0and\u00a0Hindhede where you can witness the majestic granite quarry, the waterside views at MacRitchie Reservoir\u00a0and\u00a0Punggol Waterway Park\u00a0and the rustic wildness of\u00a0Coney Island. Pit stop-wise, if you\u2019re going to be passing through Adam Road, a visit to the hawker centre is a must.\nStart at Kranji MRT station\nA humble abode to 170 species of birds, 54 types of butterflies and 33 different kinds of dragonflies, the Kranji Marshes make\u00a0a great experience for nature lovers. Start peddling at Kranji MRT station before taking on the 51.1-kilometre loop that features an elevation gain of 568-metre. Journey through the Kranji Countryside where you can make a pitstop at any one of its farms. Go further down to the Kranji War Memorial and Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve for more flora and fauna.\nStart at Rats Corner on Orchard Road\nThe Mandai Reserve may be home to the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari \u2013 with future plans to turn into an integrated nature and wildlife destination \u2013 but it also makes a great cycling trail\u00a0for some leg work. Start\u00a0at Rats Corner on Orchard Road. Then cycle north through Novena and Old Upper Thomson Road towards Mandai. Here at Mandai,\u00a0it's\u00a0known for one of the most well-loved track, especially for mountain bikers. Track 15 (also known as T15) is regarded as one of the easiest trails in Singapore with easy climbs and slopes. Great for beginners looking to pick up mountain biking. Complete\u00a0the loop southwards towards the city, along Bukit Timah Road. Be sure to go past the Old Ford Factory, the site where the British surrendered Singapore to Japan in 1942, before returning back to Rats Corner.\nStart at Marina Bay\u00a0Sands\nFor stunning views of the iconic skyline, we'd recommend starting this 11-kilometre cycling journey at sunrise or sunset as it's one of the best places to see the city bathed in\u00a0glorious golden hues. Begin at Marina Bay Sands before wheeling across the Helix Bridge, continuing towards the Esplanade and Merlion. Be careful not to speed your way through the Marina Bay Waterfront as it can get quite busy with crowds.\nStart at Punggol Jetty\nOne of the quickest ways to explore this rustic island is by cycling. While you can bring your own bike and start cycling from Punggol Jetty, you can easily rent one from the rental shop at The Punggol Settlement just outside the island. Get adventurous and check out the coastal trails where you can discover the hidden beaches and mangrove swamps of the island.\nStart at Waterway Point\nLocated in a quiet, tranquil area in the northeasterrn part of Singapore, this park offers four unique themes with something in store for visitors of all ages. The Nature Cove features a picturesque view of the Waterway, with a relaxing lawn area for families to spend lazy Sundays. At the Recreation Zone, little ones can let loose with activities like water play and sand play, while the rest of the family gets a workout at the fitness corner. The Heritage Zone offers gorgeous greenery along the stretch of the old Punggol Road, where families can take a walk down memory lane, and the Green Gallery consists of a peaceful trail along the park's natural terrain. If you want to get active with your family, go for the cycling or inline skating activities, or admire the views from the Rope Bridge and Kelong Bridge.\nStart at Woodlands Waterfront Park\nA coastal park offering a northern view of the sea,\u00a0Woodlands Waterfront Park is linked to Admiralty Park via the Northern Explorer Loop (which is a whopping 25-kilometre-long, if you're up for an adventure). Besides jogging and cycling tracks, this\u00a011-hectare park houses a playground and a 1.5-kilometre-long waterfront promenade. The park is fitted with family-friendly jogging and cycling tracks where you can enjoy a panoramic view of the entire coastal park.\nStart at East Coast Park\nEast Coast Park stretches along the east coast of Singapore from Changi Airport (great for plane watching the A380), past the numerous restaurants at East Coast Seafood Centre to Fort Road. There are dedicated cycle and walking paths, bicycle and rollerblade hire stalls, a skate park, and barbecue and camping areas. Read our comprehensive cycling guide to cycling in East Coast .\nStart at Bukit Batok Nature Park\nThe serene Bukit Batok Nature Park was developed on an abandoned quarry in 1988. There are lookout points that afford\u00a0stunning views of the quarry, along with footpaths to cycle on (there's also a moderately easy hiking trail through the foliage). For a bit of history, head to the WWII memorial, which commemorates the location of one of the fiercest battles that took place in Singapore. The Western Adventure Loop connects eight parks in the West \u2013 you can cycle through Dairy Farm Nature Park , Jurong Lake Park and more.\nStart at Pulau Ubin\nA quick boat ride away, this\u00a0offshore island is quiet and, apart from the odd minibus, free of traffic, allowing riders to explore at their own leisure. Get off the boat, take a left turn and negotiate your way through the bike hire shops and restaurants in the main village and head to the international-standard Ketam Mountain Bike Park, where 10-kilometre of mountain-bike trails offer an off-road adventure for riders of all levels, from an easy white circle run to an advanced double-black diamond. The reward is a fast, albeit bumpy, descent back to sea level. Else, you can just bike around the island \u2013 it's a great way to connect to nature too. Rental hire fees start at $2 per hour (negotiation is often required) for a basic bike, with higher prices for mountain bikes for those wanting to try their luck on the trails. For other things to do, check out our guide to Pulau Ubin .\nStart at Bukit Timah Nature Reserve\nThis 1.64-square-kilometre (0.6-square mile) nature reserve is renowned for having one of the richest and most diverse ecosystems in the world. Besides hundreds of animal and insect species, it also contains more tree species than the whole of North America. There are four walking trails if hiking is your thing but mountain bikers will love the Bukit Timah MTB Trail. Taking on the 6.5-kilometre loop requires some experience as the rugged route goes through extended climbs and arguably difficult descents \u2013 hence making it popular among the more seasoned riders, especially on weekend mornings.\nStart at Kent Ridge Park\nIt\u2019s a bit out of the way, but the decommissioned tank and two M114 artillery guns here are the best \u2013 and ironically safest \u2013 things for kids to play around and learn a bit of history. One of the last battles for Singapore occurred in this area. History buffs, you'll want to check out the Reflections Bukit Chandu museum, located at one end of the Canopy Walk for some interesting nuggets about World War II. Biking enthusiasts, make for the Kent Ridge MTB Trail where there's a short (2-kilometre) but technical single-track mountain biking trail that's relatively quiet on most days.\nStart at\u00a0Chestnut Nature Park\nSplit into North and South regions, Chestnut Nature Park covers 81-hectares, making it Singapore\u2019s largest nature park. The park has separate mountain biking\u00a0and hiking trails that are clearly marked out, too. The former has winding slopes and a pump track where bikers can practise their stunts, while the latter, especially along the 2.1-kilometre Southern Loop, takes you through varying terrains and steps.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "So you\u2019re looking for another destination for a weekend getaway, but prices are cray expensive. Well, it\u2019s time to consider camping in our own backyard! While most of us stopped our tent adventures at OBS, camping is still a cheap and fun getaway option.\nRoast marshmallows over a campfire, share stories about your greatest fears, and build \u2013 or at least try to build \u2013 your tents. With camping no longer permitted at Changi Beach Park, Noordin Beach in Pulau Ubin, and Sisters\u2019 Islands, you\u2019re only legally allowed to camp at 5 places in Singapore. Here\u2019s a guide to them all!\n1. Pitch a tent on Pulau Hantu Besar \u2013 The private island\nFor hardcore campers who want to rough it out like Bear Grylls, Pulau Hantu is as wild as Singapore gets. You\u2019ll really be on your own here, without 7-11s or the backup plan to Uber home. Pulau Hantu translates as \u201cGhost Island\u201d in Malay, and legend has it that Pulau Hantu was born so spirits of two great warriors of the sea could live on. Be warned, faint-hearted souls.\nWe visited the gorgeous private beach at Lazarus Island \u2013 which sadly doesn\u2019t permit camping \u2013 and Pulau Hantu takes exclusivity a step further. The 13-acre island will be all yours come nightfall. To reward you for your guts, you\u2019ll be treated with unbeatable zen, a private white sand beach and snorkelling in the reefs.\nYou have to obtain a camping permit at least 7 working days in advance by contacting the Southern Islands Management ( administrator@sentosa.com.sg ) with your name, contact number, camping dates, and number of campers.\nGetting there: No regular ferry service is available, but you can hire a private boat at West Coast Pier or Marina South Pier. Costs vary, but is approximately $40/pax for a minimum of 10 pax.\nNote: Overnight camping will not be available at Pulau Hantu Besar from Sep 2016 to Dec 2016.\n2. East Coast Park \u2013 Gotta watch the skies from dusk to dawn\nEvery Singaporean has been to East Coast Park, but few have seen its beauty from dusk till dawn. A home away from home, camp here if you\u2019re looking for the best of both worlds between comfort and adventure. You\u2019ll be fully equipped with barbecue pits, *clean* toilets, and even trusty old Macs for when the pit gets taken over by noob chefs!\nActivities at ECP will keep everyone entertained with sandcastle building, in-line skating, prawning and watersports like surfing and kayaking available. It\u2019s also your last chance to see the Big Splash before it disappears\u00a0for good in October.\nGet a permit to camp here \u2013 in areas D and G of the park \u2013 by applying online or at an AXS machine\u00a0when you arrive. You can also book bbq pits online at $16 or $20 a pit. Read on for life-saving tips on the application process and things you die die must bring!\nGetting there: Nearest MRT Bedok Station\n3. Pasir Ris Park \u2013 To tick off #Couplegoals\nWhen the day breaks, you can explore a 6-hectare mangrove trail, get lost in a maze garden, learn stand-up paddle boarding, or go for a pony ride at Gallop Stable. This will surely be a special date that you\u2019ll look back on with fond memories when you grow old.\nLikewise, you need to apply for a camping permit online or at an AXS machine at the park. Camping is permitted in areas 1 & 3 right beside the waterfront. While most things are available at your \u201ccampsite\u201d, for first-time campers, be sure to read our 1st-hand tips below.\nGetting there: Nearest MRT Pasir Ris Station\n4. West Coast Park \u2013 The king of playgrounds\nWest Coast Park is the play haven. Not just for young kids, but for everyone who\u2019s a child at heart. There are 7 massive play areas \u2013 from a flying fox installation to a spiderweb maze, and even a ninja obstacle course. Right beside it, you\u2019ll even find a giant lawn where you can run freely and let your worries be set free on a kite.\nGetting there: Nearest MRT Clementi Station\n5. Pulau Ubin \u2013 Journey into the kampung life\nThere\u2019s no camping without getting out of your comfort zone \u2013 apart from glamping , that is. And an overnight stay in a tent on Pulau Ubin is sure to keep you on your feet, as you\u2019ll have to keep a lookout the rare wild boars\u2026 among other things.\nA 10-minute bumboat ride away, you\u2019ll feel like you jumped into Back to the Future \u2013 SG version. It\u2019s the last real kampung in Singapore, where less than 100 villagers still live the idyllic life of the 60s under old wooden roofs. Staying overnight means you have time to ride up granite hills, explore Chek Jawa and its mirror-like tide pools, and immerse yourself in the rustic village. Just be sure to check the tides!\nYou can make Jelutong or Maman Beach your home for the night. If you\u2019re new to camping, choose Jelutong as it\u2019s right next to Ubin town and even has facilities for a campfire. While toilet facilities are available, the water isn\u2019t suitable for drinking or bathing. So remember to pack dry shampoo and talcum powder!\nNo permits are required, but campers are advised to inform the officers at Pulau Ubin Police Post on the day they\u2019re camping. You can also be briefed on camping do\u2019s and don\u2019ts at Nparks Info Kiosk at Ubin Jetty. For more information, call the Info Kiosk at +65 6542 4108.\nGetting there: Take a bumboat from Changi Point Ferry Terminal to Ubin Jetty ($2 per trip).\nLife-saving tips for your camping adventure\nWe might be a small city, but there\u2019s still a ton of places we can go to escape and have little adventures. Remember there\u2019s life beyond the web and many wonders of nature for us to explore a short journey away \u2013 we just need to pick a spot and get packing.\nOf course, you don\u2019t want to get psyched up for a camping trip only to realise that you forgot to bring the most important thing \u2013 tents. Here, we give you the low-down on all the things you need to know about camping, from applying for permits to other life-saving tips!\nCamping permit\n1. East Coast Park, West Coast Park, Pasir Ris Park \u2013 Campers above 16 years old with a valid residential address in Singapore can apply for a permit online or from any AXS station. Display the permit outside the tent at all times!\n2. Pulau Ubin \u2013 A camping permit is not required, but you\u2019re strongly advised to inform the officers at Pulau Ubin Police Post upon your arrival. However, if your group exceeds 20 people, write to NParks_Public_Affairs@nparks.gov.sg in case there are other large groups of campers on-site at the same time.\n3. Pulau Hantu Besar \u2013 Apply for a permit by contacting the Southern Islands Management ( administrator@sentosa.com.sg ) with your name, contact number, camping dates, and number of campers.\n4. These are the only places in Singapore where outdoor camping is allowed. Do note that camping is no longer permitted at Changi Beach Park, Noordin Beach in Pulau Ubin and Sisters\u2019 Islands.\nThings to bring\n1. Tents. From the most basic ones to things that look more like sheds, make sure they can survive both wind and rain. Scan your surroundings before setting up your tent \u2013 watch out for rat holes! Buy a tent from only $29.90 at Decathlon if you don\u2019t already have one.\n2. Sleeping bag. Invest in an airbed or inflatable pillow for utmost comfort.\n3. Lots of water and drinks. To stay hydrated. Coconut water, like the 1L packs from Coco Life, will be useful as coconut water hydrates better than water.\n4. Torch light/battery-powered lamps + extra batteries. They\u2019ll be useful as lights that you can hang inside your tent.\n5. Head lamp. It\u2019s a lifesaver for pitching tents in complete darkness. We got ours on sale at under $5 from Decathlon \u2013 no need for anything fancy here.\n6. Dry shampoo and talcum powder. In case you won\u2019t be able to shower.\n7. A portable charger for phone addicts. Please don\u2019t bring a flat one.\n8. Mess tins, solid fuel and disposable cutlery for cooking. For a full camping experience. Don\u2019t use two solid fuels in one as the fire will be too strong. To replace, just put it above the old solid fuel and they will mesh together.\n9. Food. Hungry campers are the worst. Pack simple fare like bread and spread, or level up your chef game like we did. We combined instant noodles with sausages and baked beans for our own easy-to-make Korean army stew!\n10. Trash bags. Clean up after you cook, especially in the islands, or deal with stray dogs nosing around your tent for food in the middle of the night.\n11. Tons of tissue paper and wet tissue. They ALWAYS come in handy, especially if toilets are unavailable or unclean.\n12. Ziploc bags. Waterproof all your valuables at night in case it rains.\n13. A jacket. It can get cold at night.\n14. Swiss knife. Great for just about everything.\n15. Mosquito coils/insect repellent. You don\u2019t want to get bitten by sandflies or get Zika!\nStay cool with Coco Life\nBesides forgetting your tent which will be your home for the night, the last thing you\u2019d want while camping is to be short on water. And carrying a gallon of water isn\u2019t exactly an option when your bag\u2019s going to be filled with a scroll of things to bring.\nInstead, bring a few packs of Coco Life, made from 100% coconut water. They come in 330ml and 1L packets, perfect for whichever need you have. It contains natural electrolytes to supercharge your hydration levels on-the-go, and a sip of this will put water to shame. Grab one for your next camping adventure!\nTrending\n6 hours ago\n21 hours ago\n1 day ago\n2 days ago\n3 days ago\n4 days ago\nPhone: 6514 0510\nThe opinions expressed by our users do not reflect the official position of TheSmartLocal.com or its staff.\nAll rights reserved 2012 \u2014 2020 TheSmartLocal.com\n397\nSHARES\n"

            "Learn how to grow a Bonsai tree\nMost people started growing Bonsai after buying a tree in an (online) shop. Though this is without doubt a nice way to get started, it might be more interesting (and less expensive) to learn how to grow and style a tree yourself.\nHow to grow a Bonsai tree\nDon't let the fact that 'bon-sai' is an art studied and refined for many centuries scare you off, because you are perfectly capable to learn how to grow Bonsai trees without green thumbs. Make sure to pick the right tree species for your surroundings and stick to the basic care guidelines. In this article I'll explain how to get started with growing Bonsai and introduce you to the three main techniques: cultivation, styling and care.\nGrow and cultivate trees\nHow do you make a Bonsai tree? The first step is to acquire a tree, which can be done by buying a prebonsai (rough material to be pruned and wired) or by using one of several possible cultivation techniques. Very important however is to select a tree species that fits your circumstances. Are you keen on keeping the tree indoors (which limits your options to (sub)tropical trees that can survive indoors) or would you like to put your Bonsai outside? In the latter case, most non-tropical trees will grow perfectly fine as long as they are protected from either intense sunlight or freezing temperatures. A safe bet is to select an indigenous tree species. With this short introduction you should be able to select a tree that fits your wishes, either an indoor Bonsai or an outdoor .\nNow that we have selected the kind of tree, let's proceed with ways to actually get one! One way is to buy a ready-made Bonsai tree from an (online) store. These stores often have a wide variety of tree species as well as shapes and sizes, but this comes at a price. As mentioned above you could also buy a prebonsai or nursery stock, which is 'rough material' (with potential for Bonsai) to be shaped by yourself, a great way for quick results. Similar to buying prebonsai is collecting trees from nature; but this can be tricky and should only be done with permission. You could also get a Bonsai starterkit , enabling you to create your own tree and learn the basics of Bonsai.\nA less expensive, but slow method is to cultivate a tree yourself; using seeds or cuttings. It will normally take around 3-5 years before the tree can be styled, so you might want to do this as a side project (and buy a prebonsai to get started with styling techniques already now).\nLearn more about the cultivation techniques mentioned above, or continue reading about styling and shaping Bonsai below.\nMaple Bonsai tree, by Walter Pall. More images can be found in our Bonsai gallery !\nShaping and styling techniques\nNow that we have either bought or cultivated a tree, it's time to get started with shaping and styling it. This is the creative part of growing Bonsai, as well as the difficult part. Although it took many decades to refine techniques like pruning and wiring to keep trees miniaturized, some basics can be learned quite easily. Right now we will look at the basics of pruning and wiring, but make sure to read the \"styling\" section for more detailed information on these subjects.\nBonsai is not a race, nor is it a destination. It is a never-ending journey.\nLet's begin with the single most important technique to Bonsai; pruning. Pruning is crucial in keeping trees miniaturized as well as to shape them. The goal is to create a Bonsai that resembles nature as close as possible. Spring and summer are the seasons to proceed with significant pruning; though this will depend on the type of tree you have. Make sure to buy a good concave cutter when pruning thick branches. The hollow wounds these cutters leave behind heal much better than normal cutters would. Though it is impossible to tell you which branches to prune to form your tree without actually seeing it, it helps to look at some example Bonsai progressions , and start from there. Some examples of instances in which a branch should be removed include:\nIf two branches occur at the same height of the tree, keep one of them and remove the other.\nBranches with unnatural twists and turns.\nDisproportionately thick branches at the top of the tree.\nAnother important technique to shape Bonsai trees is wiring. By wrapping anodized aluminum (or annealed copper) carefully around branches it is possible to bend and shape them, at least to a certain extent. Wiring can be applied year-round, but make sure to remove the wire before it starts scarring branches that grow thicker. Make sure to read the wiring page in the styling section for a detailed explanation.\nLearn more about the training and styling techniques mentioned above, or continue reading about how to Bonsai; Bonsai care.\nCare and maintenance\nA crucial part of information about how to grow a Bonsai tree is its maintenance and care. Although each tree species has specific care guidelines (make sure to check these for your Bonsai!), in this part I will discuss some of the basics, starting with watering.\nThe required frequency of watering a Bonsai depends on a wide range of factors, including species of tree, pot-size, soil and climate. Over-watering can result in root-rot, one of the most common causes of death. However, as Bonsai are planted in such small pots, they also tend to dry up very easily. Choosing the right soil mixture and re-potting regularly (on average every two years, to make sure the trees don't become pot-bound, making it hard to soak up and store water) is crucial to keep your tree healthy. An important rule for watering is to check frequently on your tree (instead of simply watering it once per day), and when watering to do so thoroughly (to make sure the soil absorbs the water properly).\nBesides watering and repotting, fertilization is another important thing to keep in mind. Since the trees are put in small pots, with little space and nutrients available, fertilizing regularly in the tree's growth season is key to keep it healthy. Again, it depends on the tree species when, how much and how often it needs to be fertilized. The brand or type of fertilizer (fluid or solid) doesn't matter all that much, as long as you make sure to apply smaller quantities than normal plants would require.\nFinally, placing an outdoor tree inside (or vice versa) is a sure way to kill it. Before purchasing (or cultivating) a Bonsai, decide on where you want to place it! Sub-tropical trees generally need much light and relatively high temperatures and can only live outside if you live in a warm enough climate; these trees will do perfectly fine indoors though. In case you prefer an outdoor tree, a safe bet is to choose a tree that is indigenous to your environment. In case winters get very cold some additional protection from frost can be required, because Bonsai are put in such small and shallow containers.\nConclusion, how to make a Bonsai tree?\nIn this introductory article the three steps of growing a Bonsai were explained; cultivation, styling and care. Though Bonsai is a centuries-old form of art, getting started with this fascinating hobby is not at all that difficult! This website will help you to get started and the forum is a great place to ask for advice. If you have a tree, but need help, read our \" Help! My Bonsai is dying \" article.\nWe have created several online courses with well-known Bonsai experts, for more information and free lessons, see our Bonsai Courses . Also, local Bonsai clubs organize courses and workshops that come highly recommended. Good luck!\nSubcategories\n"

            "30 May 2018\nIndoor plants should be an essential component of every interior design. Greenery brightens up indoor spaces and are known to have mood-boosting qualities.\nIndoor plants are popular because they are relatively easy to take care of, provide health benefits and can be used in a variety of indoor d\u00e9cor themes. Indoor plants are a great option for those who have little yard space for an outdoor garden or for those who live in climates with severely cold winters.\nSo, if you\u2019re caring for indoor plants for the first time, our ultimate guide will provide you with the necessary information to allow your green friends\u00a0to thrive.\nTo provide you with expert insight, we asked our Senior Horticulturist at Ambius, Matt Kostelnick , to answer the most frequently asked questions about indoor plants.\nWhat are indoor plants?\nIndoor plants are plants that grow indoors. There are a variety of tropical plants, like palms, that thrive in indoor environments.\nHow do you plant indoor plants?\nMost of the time, indoor plants are already in containers, so there is no need to plant them. There are typically only two reasons you need to plant an indoor plant.\nIf you wanted to grow bulbs indoors, then you will need to plant the bulbs yourself.\nHow much light do indoor plants need?\nSucculents and cacti need continuous, daily sunlight. Plants with foliage need roughly 8 hours of light per day. The amount of light depends on the plants you are growing, so we suggest doing research on the specific plants you are growing.\nWhat qualities make for a good indoor plant?\nThere are several qualities to look for when selecting an indoor plant.\nA good root system \u2013 This is incredibly important when choosing a plant. It\u2019s not practical to pull a plant out of its pot to check its roots but if it is a small plant , this can be done. Healthy roots are thick and light in color.\nFoliage- Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb when it comes to plant\u2019s foliage: if you can\u2019t see through it, the foliage is thick enough.\nCheck for disease \u2013 Some signs of a plant with pests or disease are: white dots, sticky residue on the leaves and a bad odor.\nWhich indoor plants require low light?\nIndoor plants that need little light could be good fits for locations where light is more dim. Some plants that require low light are:\nPhilodendron \u2013 A very common indoor plant that rarely attracts pests. It\u2019s a hearty plant that is adaptable to various environments\nPothos or Devil\u2019s Ivy- A plant with colorful and vibrant leaves. This plant does great in a variety of environments, thriving in low light or in bright, indirect light.\nDracaena \u2013 This is another popular indoor plant with long green leaves. This is one indoor plant you will want to prune if foliage gets too long.\nPeace Lily- This plant thrives best when the soil is moist, but not overwatered. If you want flowers to appear on your peace lily plant, move your plant to a darker room.\nWhich indoor plants are the easiest to take care of?\nBelow is a list of indoor plants that are easy to take care of:\nSansevieria\nPhilodendron\nWhich plants are considered indoor plants?\nPlants that require a low amount of light and water to thrive are typically known as indoor plants. Ambius considers these plants as examples of common indoor plants:\nDracaena\nWhat are examples of some common indoor plants?\nMore examples of common indoor plants include the following:\nAglaonema\nDracaena\nFerns\nPhilodendrons\nPalms\nPothos\nSpathiphyllum\nSucculents\nWhat are the best indoor plants?\nGood indoor plants will tolerate lower light and humidity.

The smaller the plant, the less expensive it will be. We do warn customers from buying plants from large retailers. Oftentimes, large retailers will sell coconut or palm trees, which are large indoor plants sold at a relatively low price.\nJust because a plant is large and sold for a low price does not mean you are getting the best deal.

If you spot pests, go to a garden center and purchase an insecticidal soap, which usually is contained in a spray bottle. When you notice bugs, spray the entire plant \u2013 the undersides and tops of the leaves as well as the stem. Next, wait about two weeks and repeat the spraying. Then, wait two more weeks and spray again.\nYou will want to spray three times because the soap usually will not eliminate eggs, which could hatch. If your plant is dealing with a severe infestation and you are unable to eradicate the pests, throw out the plant. You can also use a damp paper towel to remove a pest.\nHow do I know when to water my indoor plant?\nOver-watering is a common mistake, and you will want to make sure the plant actually requires water now or if it should wait until later. Here are some ways to see if it\u2019s time to water:\nSoil probe \u2013 This probe will draw out soil, which will help you understand how dry the soil is below the surface.\nMoisture meter \u2013 This tool tells you, on a scale, how dry soil is.\nLifting the plant up \u2013 Heaviness signifies the plant has enough water, but lightness signifies the plant is dry.\nWilting \u2013 Wilting typically happens because the plant is not getting sufficient water. Lift the plant to see if it is light in weight or if it\u2019s heavy.\nTipping \u2013 If the leaf edges begin browning and are crispy to the touch, the plant likely needs water. If the leaf edges are becoming brown but feel mushy, the plant has likely gotten too much water.\nYellow leaves \u2013 Yellow leaves may also signify that a plant has too much or too little water, but this is not always the case.\nHow do I care for peace lily plants indoors?\nPeace lily plants (spathiphyllum) could make a nice addition to your indoor space, such as an office . These plants need to be watered moderately often, but make sure you do not over-water them. If your peace lily begins wilting, just give it some water. You\u2019ll know it has enough if water begins seeping out of the pot\u2019s drainage holes. Peace lilies also will handle low light. A north-facing window is a nice location for this plant, but you do not necessarily need to put it in a window.\nIndoor Plant Design Specialists\nDo you want to add indoor plants to your workspace decor but aren\u2019t sure where to start?

Rock Climbing is a hobby that after you pick it up, it gets addictive\nStarting out rock climbing as a hobby isn\u2019t hard.\nFor\u00a01st timers who want to just give it a try, you just need to head to your nearby rock\u00a0gym, rent climbing shoes and harness for a day and be accompanied by a certified belayer ( for the majority of the\u00a0gyms). An average trip with equipment rental all included in can costs you between SGD$25 \u2013\u00a040 for the whole day, which isn\u2019t much compared to some other recreational/ adventure activities in Singapore.\nLearning how to tie the figure of 8 knot in your level 1 certification\nIn the event you did give rock climbing a shot, love it and want to take it more seriously, you can go the next tier to take a level 1 certification course at about SGD$65 \u2013 $80\u00a0which is available for booking at respective rock\u00a0gyms in Singapore OR via qualified private climb instructors, depending on your preference.

The rock gym\u2019s setup makes it friendly to top rope belay in safety with your kids or 1st timer/ beginner friends.

Would you be able to recommend one?\nNovember 30, 2016 at 9:54 am\nFor your Level 1 course ( which teaches you the basics of top rope belaying) I would suggest that you sign up at Onsight. You can google Onsight climbing gym, they are based near Mountbatten station. They provide regular courses.\nNovember 15, 2016 at 10:00 am\nLydia, can we climb solo? Or do I always need a buddy (as a belayer)? Coz I\u2019d probably want to go alone most of the time (or rather, don\u2019t really have climbing buddy). Thanks! \ud83d\ude42\nNovember 24, 2016 at 2:36 pm\nHi Sean! Ah..sport climbing usually requires a belayer. But take heart, there are now other options that one can go on their own \u2013 auto belay systems in gyms ( Climb central or climb asia has). Alternatively, you can pick up bouldering which one can go on your own.\nHope it helps!\nHey Sean,\nThere are 3 main types of climbing disciplines when it comes to a climbing gym:\n1. Top rope \u2013 as the name suggests, there\u2019s a rope attached to the top. This is the best way to start the sport, however you do require a belayer (most of the time), I say most of the time as there are auto-belay devices at Climb Centra and Climb Asia, that let you climb without a belayer, therefore, go alone. There are a lot of people that climb ad climbing is a great way to meet people too, so even if you wanna climb \u201csolo\u201d you will always make new friends to climb with eventually.\n2. Bouldering \u2013 This type of climbing can be done solo, as there is no belayer required, its done on a lower wall with soft mats below them, the \u2018routes\u2019 are shorter and are generally called \u2018problems\u2019 as compared to a top rope route they are a bit more complex and powerful.\n3. Lead climbing \u2013 The advanced form of climbing, requires a belayer, one would progress to this once they have climbed for a longer period of time.\nHope this info helped. Let me know if you have any more questions.\nKai (Lydia\u2019s climbing friend)\nHey Kai, got it. Thanks, this is useful stuff.\nAppreciate you taking the time to reply \ud83d\ude42\nMay 24, 2017 at 11:22 am\nHi there! Great info for starters but are there specific climbing gyms for bouldering and not just rock climbing!\nJune 28, 2017 at 9:15 am\nHi Brian, have updated the list of available bouldering/ climbing gyms in this article \ud83d\ude42 More bouldering gyms coming up this year well, will probably write another exclusive post on it soon.;) Stay tuned\nHi Lydia and Kai,\nThis thread is very useful. I am very keen to commit to the sports but similar to Sean, I am likely going solo. So would you advise that I do my level 1 with Climb Central/Climb Asia which has the auto belay system, before I manage to make new friends in the sport?\nOr are you aware if there are any pairing services to pair up solo climbers so they can support each other for the sport?\nThank you!\nJune 28, 2017 at 9:13 am\nHi Judah..sorry for the late response.\nyes for starters you can always enroll for a level 1 climbing course and make new friends from there. If you need a recommendation, you can also do it with a private instructor who conducts certifications, contact 96250587 quoting #lydiascapes for a special discounted rate.\nJune 19, 2017 at 3:45 pm\nHi looking for like a climbing coach to start with the sncs level 1 course.

            "Skill Level: Intermediate\nEstimated Cost: $0\nAlthough the task of trimming beautiful foliage is sometimes hard for gardeners to swallow, regular pruning keeps most plants healthy and encourages new growth. But when and what to prune depends on the type of plant and the climate you live in. For instance, flowering and fruiting plants prefer to be cut back in late winter or early spring to spur a hearty crop. Trees and shrubs that bloom in the spring start setting new buds as soon as the old flowers have fallen, so it's crucial to prune before those new buds come in. And many other plants need continual trimming to remain vigorous.\nThe Spruce\nWhen to Prune Trees and Plants\nFiguring out when to prune your plants can be confusing,\u00a0but luckily pruning at the wrong time is rarely fatal. Off-cycle pruning might result in fewer flowers or fruit, but it usually won\u2019t harm the plant in the long run. However, avoid pruning too late in the growing season. Doing so will encourage tender new growth that will die in winter weather.\nMost fruit trees and berry plants need to be pruned while they are dormant . Failure to do so will result in the plant's steady decline, as it will send out suckers that direct energy away from fruiting branches. The exception to this rule is spring-flowering trees and shrubs. These need to be pruned soon after their flowers fade in late spring and early summer.\nFurthermore, most perennial plants need to be cut back entirely either before or after the growing season. And they require regular pruning and deadheading all season long.\nWhat You'll Need\nPruning Fruit Trees\nIf you are growing a tree for its fruit, make pruning a high priority. Heading cuts , or cutting the ends of branches, concentrate each branch's energy and encourage it to produce more fruit the following season. Thinning cuts, or removing entire limbs, allow you to take out unruly suckers and dead or diseased limbs.\nInspect Your Tree\nIn the late winter or early spring, inspect your tree to see where it needs pruning. Take note of any branches that have grown over 2 feet. They will be unlikely to bear fruit again.\nIdentify Which Branches to Keep and Remove\nDecide which branches to keep and which to remove based on health, shape, growth pattern, and personal preference. Sometimes it's helpful to mark branches for pruning with pieces of string as you're observing the whole tree.\nRemove Unwanted Branches\nUse loppers or a handsaw to remove dead or diseased branches, as well as any unnecessary new branches that might divert energy from the fruit-bearing ones. Branches growing downward should be the first to go.\nMake Heading Cuts\nWith your loppers, make heading cuts on old growth around the tree to shape it. Each cut will increase the number of lateral branches.\nPruning Berries\nRaspberry and blackberry bushes in particular benefit from removing all the weak and broken canes (or stems) to allow sunlight to reach more of the bush. Make sure to wear protective clothing when pruning berries , as the thorns can be painful.\nRemove Unwanted Canes\nDuring October through March, remove any weak, dead, or diseased canes with pruning shears.\nThin the Canes\nThin the remaining canes to 10 to 12 per bush by cutting unruly canes at their base.\nTrim the Height\nTrim the height of the entire bush, so it's no more than five feet tall.\nPruning Flowering Trees, Shrubs, and Vines\nIn general, you can prune flowering plants at any time. However, paying attention to when your plant blooms and pruning soon after will yield the showiest floral display.\nNote Plant Bloom Time\nDuring the First Growing Season, Note When Your Plant Blooms\nRemove Unwanted Branches\nOnce the blooms fade, use your shears or loppers to remove any dead, weak, or diseased branches.\nRemove Suckers at the Base of the Tree or Plant\nThese are unlikely to produce hearty blooms.\nShape the Plant\nUsing your shears, make heading cuts to shape the plant. Cut just beyond a healthy bud, and angle the cut at 45 degrees.\nPruning Perennials\nPerhaps the most labor-intensive plants to prune are non-woody perennials, but the task is pretty straightforward. Regular pruning and deadheading (pinching off spent flowers) throughout the growing cycle can create a perfectly manicured perennial bed.\nCut Back on Dead Growth\nIn the fall or early spring, use your shears to cut back all dead growth to the ground.\nStart Training Your Plant\nAs the plant grows, train it by cutting off or digging up parts that become unruly. Dug up perennial plants can be replanted or gifted to other gardeners.\nPinch Flowers Below the Bloom\nDuring the growing season, regularly pinch or cut off spent flowers just below the bloom to maintain appearance.\nTrim Growth\nWorking With Evergreens\nMany gardeners leave their evergreen trees alone, which is probably a good idea. Evergreen trees don\u2019t really need to be pruned, and doing so can stress or distort the tree. For this reason, choose a dwarf evergreen if you have limited space.\nThat said, there are times when evergreen bushes need to be cut into a hedgerow or trimmed to branch out and become fuller. This requires mindful, minimal trimming during the height of the growing season.\nPlant Pruning Tips\nIf you haven't been pruning your fruit-bearing bushes regularly, you might need to do some rejuvenation pruning to remove anything that's overgrown or dead. You can cut back the entire plant to 6 to 12 inches of growth (basically starting over), or you can prune gradually over time.\nUnlike other fruit trees, peach trees should not be pruned while dormant. This delicate tree can suffer dieback when pruned in the winter. Pruning a peach tree during dormancy can also result in a less cold-hardy tree moving forward.\nThe popularity of hydrangea plants has spurred many different varieties, some that bloom on both old and new wood. For this reason, traditional pruning techniques have become outdated for certain types. So be sure to check the recommendations for your variety.\nHow and when to prune perennial plants is something you learn as you acquire gardening experience. It\u2019s the type of knowledge that varies from region to region, and it\u2019s part of the pleasure of gardening.\nEmail Address\nSign up\nFollow us:\n"

            "9\n60+\nPublications contributing to science and conservation in the last 5 years\nAs a world-leading zoological institution, Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) contributes to the conservation of biodiversity through a number of initiatives, including local and regional conservation support, wildlife research, and awareness campaigns to combat major threats such as the illegal wildlife trade.\nSunda Pangolin National Conservation Action Plan\n50 local and international conservationists convened at the Singapore Zoo to consider the plight of the Sunda pangolin in Singapore and create a Singapore-wide plan of conservation action for the species.\nConserving Javan gibbon habitats and promoting shade coffee\nNumbering between 4,000 and 4,500 in the wild, Javan gibbons face severe habitat loss caused by increasing land use for human development. As villagers grow coffee right under the homes of the gibbons, their actions easily impact the animals above. Sustainable coffee farming supported by WRS helps conserve forests and the gibbons.\nAsian Songbird Trade Specialist Group\nWRS played a key role in driving the formation of the Asian Songbird Trade Specialist Group \u2013 a natural progression from the two Songbird Trade Crisis Summits in 2015 and 2017. This specialist group will implement the conservation strategy and action plans discussed at these meetings.\nConservation of Singapore's own Raffles' banded langur\nDiscovered by Sir Stamford Raffles himself, the Raffles\u2019 banded langur (also known as banded leaf monkey) was once commonly found throughout Singapore. Today, it\u2019s on the Endangered list, but research has revealed that it may be an even more threatened species than is currently recognised.\nAssessing the population status and ecological niche of the Yellow-Crested Cockatoo in Singapore\nWildlife trade erodes biodiversity and alters the balance between native and introduced species in many parts of Asia. The critically endangered yellow-crested cockatoo has suffered serious decline in eastern Indonesia and Timor Leste because of the demand for caged birds. But there is a small introduced population in Singapore. Researchers are looking at how these birds impact on native species, and how the cockatoo population has grown here, so that more can be done to grow its numbers in its native habitat of Indonesia and Timor Leste.\nAutomated acoustic monitoring of amphibians\nAcoustic techniques have been used across the world for a long time to collect the vocalisations of animals like birds, amphibians and insects. These soundscapes tell us about the presence and absence of wildlife in the environment and whether some species are disappearing. We know very little about amphibians in Southeast Asia. Acoustic monitoring is one way to find out where they are, and whether they are disappearing because of development and degradation.\nRecovering a Siamese Crocodile Population in Sre Ambel River, Cambodia\nThe Siamese Crocodile formerly occurred in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, parts of Indonesian Borneo, and Peninsular Malaysia. But populations have drastically in the last 50 years, as a result of widespread habitat destruction, over-collecting to stock crocodile farms, and illegal hunting for skins and meat. Sre Ambel river system in Cambodia and its surrounding habitats hold one of the last remaining global breeding sites for the species. Conservationists are fighting to save it before it goes extinct.\nConserving Cambodia\u2019s Royal Turtle\nOnce presumed extinct, Cambodia\u2019s national turtle, the Southern River Terrapin, is also one of the rarest species of its kind in the world. Rediscovered in 2001 and protected by a royal decree, conservationists are on a mission to increase wild populations and ensure that the terrapin will not become extinct again.\nAddressing human-orangutan conflict in agricultural landscapes\nAgricultural expansion and infrastructural development have resulted in the loss of large areas of orangutan habitat. Pushed out of their natural environment into areas where forest and farmlands meet, Sumatran orangutans come into conflict with humans, ending up injured or worse, captured to be kept as illegal pets.\nCollaborative Governance and Monitoring of Biodiversity Impact: Working Together to Protect Tangkoko Nature Reserve, North Sulawesi, Indonesia\nSulawesi is a vital biodiversity hotspot in Southeast Asia with numerous bird and mammal species that are unique to the island. One of its most charismatic species is the Celebes crested macaque. In Sulawesi, where religious restrictions over the consumption of wildlife do not exist, these enigmatic primates are hunted and eaten because their meat is considered a delicacy. More than other environmental factors, this alone threatens the long-term survival of the species.\nConservation of the Nantu Forest in North Sulawesi\nCovering an area of 520km2, the Nantu rainforest is one of Sulawesi\u2019s few remaining pristine lowland rainforest ecosystems and one of the five most important sites for biodiversity in Southeast Asia. But the forest and its endemic species like the Babirusa and the Anoa are being threatened by wildlife poaching, illegal mining and slash and burn practices, as well as illegal logging. Conservationists are battling to protect it by establishing round the clock Forest & Species Protection Patrols.\nBiodiversity conservation in Nakai-Nam Theun National Protected Area\nSadly notorious for being the region with both remarkable biodiversity and the highest biodiversity extinction risk in the world, Southeast Asia\u2019s conservationists are battling illegal hunting and poaching, which largely services the illegal wildlife trade and consumption of animal parts in traditional medicine. Laos PDR is no exception. Its threatened wildlife may be locally extinct in the near future with poachers from Vietnam crossing poorly patrolled borders to hunt species in its remaining protect areas. On site conservation efforts are critical to ensure this will not happen.\nEnding the practice of bear bile farming in Laos PDR\nSince the 20th century, Asiatic black bears and Sun bears have been kept in captivity in countries like North Korea, China and Vietnam to extract bile from the gallbladders in the belief that it is a potent ingredient in traditional medicine. The trend has taken off in Laos, but conservationists are determined to work with the government and international partners to end bear bile farming in the country by 2020.\nTigers on the brink\nFrom a thriving population of 3,000 in the 1950s, only 250 Malayan tigers remain today. The Malaysian Conservation Alliance for Tigers (MyCAT) conducts Citizen Action for Tigers (CAT) walks to closely monitor the activity of poachers and remove traps in the area. Their intervention has already curbed tiger poaching with minimal disturbance to wildlife.\nMeasures to improve captive husbandry and translocation of the Palawan forest turtle\nThe Palawan forest turtle is a critically endangered endemic species from the Philippines island of Palawan. Threatened by the global pet trade and habitat destruction, conservationists holding the assurance colony for the species are striving to meet the challenge of successfully breeding the species in captivity through intensive research into its diet, nesting sites, incubation time and a better understanding of habitat conditions in release sites.\nKing cobra conservation - Education and capacity building in rural northeast Thailand\nSituated in Thailand\u2019s northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is home to the king cobra and numerous endemic and threatened animals. The king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world and as an apex predator, it plays a critical role in the ecosystem. Both under-studied and misunderstood, work is ongoing with communities to protect the species instead of fearing it.\nConservation of the Tonkin Snub-nosed Monkey in Khau Ca Forest, Northeast Vietnam\nOne of the most endangered primates in the world, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is endemic to northeast Vietnam, where it can be found in tropical evergreen forests of karst limestone hills. Threatened by intensive hunting and deforestation, a team of conservationists are protecting the largest viable population of the species in the country.\nAsian Species Action Partnership\nThe Asian Species Action Partnership (ASAP) is an interagency coalition to address the extinction risk among the most threatened non-marine vertebrates of Southeast Asia. Initiated by the IUCN Special Survival Commission, it endeavours to mobilize support, draw on the expertise of conservationists and minimise losing key species, which could be imminent in the next few decades.\nTacking Wildlife Trade in Southeast Asia\nMore than 160 species of terrestrial vertebrates in the Southeast Asia have been assessed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. With support from WRS, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia is monitoring the trade on threatened species in the region, to bring attention to conservation issues, increase media coverage and produce scientific papers to raise awareness and mitigate the effects of the illegal wildlife trade on regional biodiversity.\nApply for conservation support\nWRS is proud to contribute to the protection of threatened species in their native habitats by funding local and regional conservation and research projects. We are keen to support: (a) Projects that have a direct and positive impact on the survival of a threatened species in the wild; (b) Research that can help develop better tools and strategies for the management of captive wild animal populations; (c) Studies that will benefit conservation strategy planning for species in their native habitats; and (d) Efforts that encourage and foster sustainable and ethical behaviours towards animals and nature through engaging and innovative conservation out-reach programs.\nConservation support for projects within Singapore\nEstablished in 2009, WRSCF supports research initiatives that focus on Singapore\u2019s biodiversity. The fund has supported the protection of many species including the endangered banded leaf monkey, the elusive leopard cat and coral reefs.\nSoutheast Asia is an important biodiversity hotspot in need of sustainable conservation efforts. We have supported numerous projects in the region through funding on-ground projects, as well as capacity building workshops.\nWildlife Reserves Singapore Group\n\u00a9 Copyright 2020, Wildlife Reserves Singapore Group.

            "Reducing waste and adopting a circular economy approach will benefit the environment and create economic opportunities.\nAs a small city state, Singapore has always been aware of the need to balance economic development and environmental sustainability.\nGrowing our economy consumes energy, water and other resources which we lack, and generates sewerage and solid waste that must be disposed of. These are challenges for any country, but especially so for Singapore where resources and land are scarce. Our only landfill, the Semakau Landfill, will be filled up within years at our current rate of waste generation.\nTo overcome these challenges and continue to grow sustainably, Singapore must adopt a circular economy approach. This requires a shift from the \u2018use and throw\u2019 mentality, to one where resources are re-used for as long as possible.\nWhat is the circular economy?\nA circular economy is an alternative to a traditional linear economy (take, make, waste). It seeks to reduce waste, recovers resources at the end of a product\u2019s life, and channels them back into production, thus significantly reducing pressure on the environment.\nWhy a circular economy approach is important\nAs well as creating new opportunities for growth, a more circular economy will:\nreduce waste\nposition Singapore to better address emerging resource security/scarcity issues in the future.\nhelp reduce the environmental impacts of our production and consumption in both Singapore and abroad\nExtended Producer Responsibility\nThis includes Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) , starting with electronic-waste, which we will introduce by 2021. Apart from e-waste, we are studying the feasibility of extending EPR to packaging waste .\nWhen producers are responsible for the \u2018end-of-life\u2019 of their products, they will be more incentivised to design products that are easily recycled, or come up with innovative circular business models to close their waste loop.\nSupporting and partnering industries\nA research grant call under the \u201c Closing the Waste Loop Initiative \u201d was launched for the sustainable design of plastic materials. The goal is to allow for plastics to be more reusable, easier to recycle, and to extract value from waste plastics. By encouraging collaboration between the institutes of higher learning, research institutes and businesses, we will be in a stronger position to introduce fresh approaches to solving the longstanding plastic challenge, and capture the innovation value.\n"

Look out for your first newsletter in your inbox soon!\nThe best temples to visit in Singapore\nThe best temples to visit in Singapore\nA cultural melting pot, Singapore home to plenty of religious sites that offer an insightful look at different customs\nAdvertising\nChinatown\nOddly enough, the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore is smack in the middle of Chinatown. It was built (as a humble shed) in 1827 by Naraina Pillai, the first recorded Indian immigrant to enter colonised Singapore (he travelled with Raffles from Penang). Completed in 1863, it\u2019s famous for its staggeringly detailed gopuram (tower gateway). It is also the site of Theemidhi, a remarkable fire-walking ceremony held a week before the Hindu festival Deepavali, usually in October. If you want to take photos, you have to pay $3 ($6 for video cameras).\nRochor\nThis Buddhist temple, built in 1884, is dedicated to Kwan Im (also called Guanyin), the goddess of mercy, and was used as a refuge for the sick and destitute during the Japanese occupation. Today, hundreds of worshippers flood in every day; the main prayer hall is a flurry of activity as people take turns to kneel on the prayer carpet in front of the golden Buddha, where they shake i-ching sticks.\nRochor\nWhat began in 1870 as a banyan tree with a few deities placed next to it has evolved into a vivid, colourful temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, the supreme god in Hindu cosmology. Much of the current building was constructed in the 1980s and don't be surprised when you see Chinese devotees light joss sticks here as well \u2013 the temple is located close to Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple and the management even built an altar dedicated to Guan Yin within its temple's grounds.\nTiong Bahru\nAs Singapore\u2019s first \u2013 and possibly only \u2013 temple dedicated to the Monkey God, this 95-year-old temple has more than ten statues of the Taoist deity within its premises. Some of them even date back over a century, making this beautifully anachronistic building (it\u2019s smack in the middle of hipster central, Tiong Bahru) a heritage hotspot where your kids can live and breathe history. Look out for Uncle Lim, the chatty temple caretaker who\u2019ll tell you all about the Monkey God and its many different incarnations.\nKent Ridge\nLocated on a small hilltop, 'Temple of Thanksgiving' is Singapore's first ecologically green temple. First\u00a0built in 1954 as a memorial to those who lost their lives during the Battle of Pasir Panjang in 1942, the Buddhist temple was rebuilt in 2003, complete with solar energy cells on its rooftop.\nKallang\nThis\u00a0164-year-old temple was recently restored to the tune of $4.5 million but it's also been renovated several times, particularly in the 1960s, with the gopuram erected only as recently as 1979. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temple features decorations of the deity in his many incarnations. Statues of him, his consorts and Garuda (the bird he flies on) can be seen inside.\nTanjong Pagar\nA century ago, Telok Ayer Street was right up against the sea. And this temple, known as the Temple of Heavenly Happiness, was popular with newly arrived immigrants, who came here to burn incense in thanks to Ma Cho Po (a Taoist deity and protector of seafarers) for their safe arrival. Some of the materials used in the temple were taken from the boats, including the rooftop mosaic. Inside, the main altar features a statue of Ma Cho Po, and other deities of luck, war and punishment.\nRochor\nLittle India\u2019s most popular Hindu temple is dedicated to the goddess Kali, often misrepresented in the West as a deity of destruction, but actually a benevolent (if powerful) figure. The building was apparently constructed by Bengali immigrants, and completed in 1881, but like all such monuments in Singapore has gone through many extensions and renovations over the years. The gopuram (tower entrance) is strikingly decorated with multicoloured depictions of numerous Hindu deities, while the main shrine houses a jet black statue of Kali, flanked by her sons Ganesha and Murugam. You can spot those who have been blessed at this temple: they have white ash on their forehead, rather than the usual dark colours.\nRaffles Place\nAlso known as the Calm Sea Temple, built in 1826 by Teochew fisherman. Set back from the road, the temple\u2019s wide forecourt is dominated by incense coils hung on wires. Note the large kilns for burning \u2018hell money\u2019 and other offerings to the dead.\nToa Payoh\nThis 1908 Buddhist monastery, Siong Lim Temple, for short, is the oldest in Singapore. An 11-year, $40m restoration project was completed in 2002 (using carpenters and artisans from China), but it still remains a fine specimen of classic Chinese-style architecture. Highlights include the two magnificent 9.1m wooden entrance gates and the 29m Dragon Light Pagoda built entirely of granite and topped with a golden spire.\nChinatown\nA 15-foot Maitreya Buddha that sits on the ground floor of the main hall and on the third storey lies the Buddhist Cultural Museum. It displays a selection of rare artefacts detailing the history of Buddhism and the different traditions practised in Asian countries. Located at the rear of the hall, you\u2019ll find the Sacred Buddha Relics Chamber. This houses what are regarded as the brains, blood, muscle and flesh relics of Buddha. According to the religion\u2019s beliefs, these items are supposedly Buddha\u2019s body in eternal form.\nGeylang\nOne of the oldest Cantonese temples in Singapore with 150 years of history, Mun San Fook Tuck Chee temple used to be a communal hub for coolies. Also known as Sar Kong Temple, the building sits on land that is slated to be redeveloped. It is home to the Sar Kong Mun San Fook Tuck Chee Lion Dance Troupe that puts up a fire dragon performance where a straw dragon is lit up in flames and paraded up and down the streets of the HDB flats nearby, like it once did in the nearby villages back in the day.\nGet us in your inbox\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city and beyond\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!

            "Open a new search\nStart search\nnews 5 exciting Malaysian whitewater adventures you need to try soon\n5 exciting Malaysian whitewater adventures you need to try soon\nMalaysia is mostly famous for its surrounding waters, and beckons scuba and snorkelling enthusiasts from all over the world. However, those who discount Malaysia's rivers are missing opportunities for some of the best whitewater in the region. Here is Skyscanner 's list of favourite whitewater experiences throughout the country. While some river experiences are sedate floats, these have the volume and the rapids to make for a wild, wet time.\n1. Sungai Selangor (Kuala Lumpur, Selangor)\nThe selangor is one of Malaysia\u2019s most popular whitewater trips for two reasons. First, it\u2019s a long river with lots of challenging rapids that aren\u2019t quite as dangerous. Second, it\u2019s the closest whitewater option to Kuala Lumpur and makes for a suitable day trip. You can choose between the Upper Selangor, which is more sedate but still has some good riffles and runs, or the 7-kilometre roller coaster of grade III and IV rapids that is the Lower Selangor.\n2. Sungai Kampar (Ipoh, Perak)\nThe Kampar run is the gentlest rafting option that still has some thrills and spills. They take rafters as young as five, but also has plenty of class II and III bumps to keep things interesting. Guide groups that run Kampar trips will also tack on additional adventures, like jungle treks and caving. Book an overnight expedition to get the most out of this river journey, and take advantage of side treks and adventures while you\u2019re out.\n3. Sungai Tembeling (Kuantan, Pahang)\nThe Tembeling can be a mad rush of high-difficulty rapids, or it can be a flat stretch of water where you only get wet if the driver tips the boat. Don\u2019t let that deter you \u2014 the trip is still on a river through parts of Malaysia\u2019s oldest and justifiably best-known national park. Just contact a tour operator early to get the news on the state of the rapids, and be sure to book night jungle trekking, canopy tours and Orang Asli visits while you\u2019re in the area.\n4. Sungai Padas (Sabah)\nConsidered the best rafting in Malaysia, and by many in Asia as a whole, the Padas is not for the inexperienced, young, or faint of heart. This collection of class III and IV rapids offers a day of bumps and thumps. Its 7 rapids include the infamous Lambada and Head Hunter, and are guaranteed to get you wet. While only accessible by train, don\u2019t worry about the ride: the trip there and back on an antique rail car is a feature, not a bug, of this rafting adventure.\n5. Sungai Singor (Ipoh, Perak)\nThis is considered the wildest river in Malaysia, and a full 3-day run includes grades III through the heart-stopping VI, plus two waterfalls you have to port because they\u2019re impassable. Shorter runs are available, but for the best experience, book the entire tour to experience the side treks, climbing, scrambling and soaking that this reliably near-perfect water has to offer. This is helmet-and-paddle work, and for veteran \"river rats\" only.\nA warm-up run on the wild Singor River. Image copyright: WhoaAdventure\nPlanning a rafting trip is just a matter of contacting your guide group, then booking your flight to the nearest regional airport. If your tour doesn\u2019t include lodging, book your hotel with us to get the best discounts possible.\nReturn\nWell we'd love it if you left us a review.\n(It only takes 30 seconds, we promise!)\n"

            "Leading up to World War II\nThe devastation of the Great War (as World War I was known at the time) had greatly destabilized Europe, and in many respects World War II grew out of issues left unresolved by that earlier conflict. In particular, political and economic instability in Germany, and lingering resentment over the harsh terms imposed by the Versailles Treaty, fueled the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist (Nazi) Party.\nDid you know? As early as 1923, in his memoir and propaganda tract \"Mein Kampf\" (My Struggle), Adolf Hitler had predicted a general European war that would result in \"the extermination of the Jewish race in Germany.\"\nAfter becoming Reich Chancellor in 1933, Hitler swiftly consolidated power, anointing himself F\u00fchrer (supreme leader) in 1934. Obsessed with the idea of the superiority of the \u201cpure\u201d German race, which he called \u201cAryan,\u201d Hitler believed that war was the only way to gain the necessary \u201cLebensraum,\u201d or living space, for that race to expand. In the mid-1930s, he began the rearmament of Germany, secretly and in violation of the Versailles Treaty. After signing alliances with Italy and Japan against the Soviet Union , Hitler sent troops to occupy Austria in 1938 and the following year annexed Czechoslovakia. Hitler\u2019s open aggression went unchecked, as the United States and Soviet Union were concentrated on internal politics at the time, and neither France nor Britain (the two other nations most devastated by the Great War) were eager for confrontation.\nOutbreak of World War II (1939)\nIn late August 1939, Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact , which incited a frenzy of worry in London and Paris. Hitler had long planned an invasion of Poland, a nation to which Great Britain and France had guaranteed military support if it was attacked by Germany. The pact with Stalin meant that Hitler would not face a war on two fronts once he invaded Poland, and would have Soviet assistance in conquering and dividing the nation itself. On September 1, 1939, Hitler invaded Poland from the west; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, beginning World War II.\nOn September 17, Soviet troops invaded Poland from the east. Under attack from both sides, Poland fell quickly, and by early 1940 Germany and the Soviet Union had divided control over the nation, according to a secret protocol appended to the Nonaggression Pact. Stalin\u2019s forces then moved to occupy the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and defeated a resistant Finland in the Russo-Finish War. During the six months following the invasion of Poland, the lack of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west led to talk in the news media of a \u201cphony war.\u201d At sea, however, the British and German navies faced off in heated battle, and lethal German U-boat submarines struck at merchant shipping bound for Britain, sinking more than 100 vessels in the first four months of World War II.\nWorld War II in the West (1940-41)\nOn April 9, 1940, Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and occupied Denmark, and the war began in earnest. On May 10, German forces swept through Belgium and the Netherlands in what became known as \u201cblitzkrieg,\u201d or lightning war. Three days later, Hitler\u2019s troops crossed the Meuse River and struck French forces at Sedan, located at the northern end of the Maginot Line , an elaborate chain of fortifications constructed after World War I and considered an impenetrable defensive barrier. In fact, the Germans broke through the line with their tanks and planes and continued to the rear, rendering it useless. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated by sea from Dunkirk in late May, while in the south French forces mounted a doomed resistance. With France on the verge of collapse, Benito Mussolini of Italy put his Pact of Steel with Hitler into action, and Italy declared war against France and Britain on June 10.\nOn June 14, German forces entered Paris; a new government formed by Marshal Philippe Petain (France\u2019s hero of World War I) requested an armistice two nights later. France was subsequently divided into two zones, one under German military occupation and the other under Petain\u2019s government, installed at Vichy France. Hitler now turned his attention to Britain, which had the defensive advantage of being separated from the Continent by the English Channel.\nTo pave the way for an amphibious invasion (dubbed Operation Sea Lion), German planes bombed Britain extensively throughout the summer of 1940, including night raids on London and other industrial centers that caused heavy civilian casualties and damage. The Royal Air Force (RAF) eventually defeated the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in the Battle of Britain , and Hitler postponed his plans to invade. With Britain\u2019s defensive resources pushed to the limit, Prime Minister Winston Churchill began receiving crucial aid from the U.S. under the Lend-Lease Act , passed by Congress in early 1941.\nOperation Barbarossa (1941-42)\nBy early 1941, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria had joined the Axis, and German troops overran Yugoslavia and Greece that April. Hitler\u2019s conquest of the Balkans was a precursor for his real objective: an invasion of the Soviet Union, whose vast territory would give the German master race the \u201cLebensraum\u201d it needed. The other half of Hitler\u2019s strategy was the extermination of the Jews from throughout German-occupied Europe. Plans for the \u201cFinal Solution\u201d were introduced around the time of the Soviet offensive, and over the next three years more than 4 million Jews would perish in the death camps established in occupied Poland.\nOn June 22, 1941, Hitler ordered the invasion of the Soviet Union, codenamed Operation Barbarossa . Though Soviet tanks and aircraft greatly outnumbered the Germans\u2019, their air technology was largely obsolete, and the impact of the surprise invasion helped Germans get within 200 miles of Moscow by mid-July. Arguments between Hitler and his commanders delayed the next German advance until October, when it was stalled by a Soviet counteroffensive and the onset of harsh winter weather.\nWorld War II in the Pacific (1941-43)\nWith Britain facing Germany in Europe, the United States was the only nation capable of combating Japanese aggression, which by late 1941 included an expansion of its ongoing war with China and the seizure of European colonial holdings in the Far East. On December 7, 1941, 360 Japanese aircraft attacked the major U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii , taking the Americans completely by surprise and claiming the lives of more than 2,300 troops. The attack on Pearl Harbor served to unify American public opinion in favor of entering World War II, and on December 8 Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote. Germany and the other Axis Powers promptly declared war on the United States.\nAfter a long string of Japanese victories, the U.S. Pacific Fleet won the Battle of Midway in June 1942, which proved to be a turning point in the war. On Guadalcanal, one of the southern Solomon Islands, the Allies also had success against Japanese forces in a series of battles from August 1942 to February 1943, helping turn the tide further in the Pacific. In mid-1943, Allied naval forces began an aggressive counterattack against Japan, involving a series of amphibious assaults on key Japanese-held islands in the Pacific. This \u201cisland-hopping\u201d strategy proved successful, and Allied forces moved closer to their ultimate goal of invading the Japanese homeland.\nToward Allied Victory in World War II (1943-45)\nIn North Africa , British and American forces had defeated the Italians and Germans by 1943. An Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy followed, and Mussolini\u2019s government fell in July 1943, though Allied fighting against the Germans in Italy would continue until 1945.\nOn World War II\u2019s Eastern Front, a Soviet counteroffensive launched in November 1942 ended the bloody Battle of Stalingrad , which had seen some of the fiercest combat of the war. The approach of winter, along with dwindling food and medical supplies, spelled the end for German troops there, and the last of them surrendered on January 31, 1943.\nOn June 6, 1944\u2013celebrated as \u201cD-Day\u201d \u2013the Allies began a massive invasion of Europe, landing 156,000 British, Canadian and American soldiers on the beaches of Normandy, France. In response, Hitler poured all the remaining strength of his army into Western Europe, ensuring Germany\u2019s defeat in the east. Soviet troops soon advanced into Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania, while Hitler gathered his forces to drive the Americans and British back from Germany in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944-January 1945), the last major German offensive of the war.\nAn intensive aerial bombardment in February 1945 preceded the Allied land invasion of Germany, and by the time Germany formally surrendered on May 8, Soviet forces had occupied much of the country. Hitler was already dead, having died by suicide on April 30 in his Berlin bunker.\nWorld War II Ends (1945)\nAt the Potsdam Conference of July-August 1945, U.S. President Harry S. Truman (who had taken office after Roosevelt\u2019s death in April), Churchill and Stalin discussed the ongoing war with Japan as well as the peace settlement with Germany. Post-war Germany would be divided into four occupation zones, to be controlled by the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States and France. On the divisive matter of Eastern Europe\u2019s future, Churchill and Truman acquiesced to Stalin, as they needed Soviet cooperation in the war against Japan.\nHeavy casualties sustained in the campaigns at Iwo Jima (February 1945) and Okinawa (April-June 1945), and fears of the even costlier land invasion of Japan led Truman to authorize the use of a new and devastating weapon. Developed during a top secret operation code-named The Manhattan Project, the atomic bomb was unleashed on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August. On August 15, the Japanese government issued a statement declaring they would accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, and on September 2, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan\u2019s formal surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.\nWorld War II Casualties and Legacy\nWorld War II proved to be the deadliest international conflict in history, taking the lives of 60 to 80 million people, including 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust . Civilians made up an estimated 50-55 million deaths from the war, while military comprised 21 to 25 million of those lost during the war. Millions more were injured, and still more lost their homes and property.\nThe legacy of the war would include the spread of communism from the Soviet Union into eastern Europe as well as its eventual triumph in China, and the global shift in power from Europe to two rival superpowers\u2013the United States and the Soviet Union\u2013that would soon face off against each other in the Cold War .\nAccess hundreds of hours of historical video, commercial free, with HISTORY Vault .

            "Destinations\nLocations\nSingapore\u2019s distinct Buddhist temples boast incredible architecture that can\u2019t be witnessed elsewhere. Here are the 10 most beautiful in the city-state.\nBuddhism has quite the history in Singapore, thanks to the legacy of early settlers, traders and missionaries. Despite this, a lot of the temples here were only built fairly recently. More than a third of the Singaporean population professes belief in Buddhism, making it the biggest religious denomination by population in the city state. The architecture of these temples is very unique, showcasing strong Indian subcontinental influences and imposing styles. If you\u2019re keen to learn more, Singapore has some fascinating sites worth checking out.\nKong Men San Phor Kark See Monastery\nBuddhist Temple\nAs the largest Buddhist temple in Singapore, this monumental structure is revered for the many services it provides to the local Buddhist population. It\u2019s especially worth visiting during Buddhist festivals like Vesak Day. The architectural style shows some Chinese influence (which should come as no surprise given that most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese). It also houses some unique artefacts like the Bodhi Tree, which is believed to be related to the very same tree Buddha attained enlightenment under, and a gargantuan bronze statue of Buddha himself \u2013 one of the largest found in Asia.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddha Tooth Relic Temple\nBuddhist Temple, History Museum\nAbsolutely impossible to miss when in Chinatown, this eye-catching temple is actually very new. Completed in 2005, it\u2019s built along classical Chinese Tang Dynasty-inspired architecture. This massive edifice has fast become one of Chinatown\u2019s most famous attractions despite its short history, hosting a brilliant museum and a number of Buddhist rituals and festivals throughout the year. Be sure to catch one for a glimpse of Singapore\u2019s strong Buddhist traditions in full swing.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nSingapore\u2019s oldest monastery is a deeply mysterious structure, designed and built by an unknown architect. This stunning site is believed to be modelled after Xi Chan Si temple in Fujian province in China. Both temples are themselves famed replicas of Cong Lin style architecture, which is popular in Buddhist architecture across China. It boasts a strong distinctive regional influence from Fujian province, which can be seen in the beams and wood carvings. This gazetted national monument also boasts a seven-storey, gold-capped pagoda made famous by Instagram-happy visitors.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nWat Ananda Metyaram is one of Singapore\u2019s oldest Theravada temples, constructed in 1925. The present building is remarkably very different from its predecessor, having abandoned traditional architecture for a more modernist look. Sheathed in white with striking edges and beautifully-crafted triangular cutouts, this temple has completely reinterpreted classical Thai style into something daringly contemporary.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nBuddhist Temple\nAlso known as the \u2018Temple of 1,000 Lights\u2019, this popular devotional site built in 1927 is also part of the Theravada tradition, maintaining a decidedly more traditional appearance. Its mystical nickname has to do with the large 15-foot Buddha statue that greets you while you enter. If you look closely, you will see the eminent form is surrounded by the glow of 1000 colourful icon lamps. Visitors are also enchanted by the popular reclining Buddha statue and the frescoes depicting Buddha\u2019s life and his quest for enlightenment.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nOtherwise known as Burmese Buddhist Temple, Maha Sasani Ramsi is considered the oldest Theravada site in Singapore and one of the city\u2019s major claims to fame. Besides being an important cultural centre for the local Burmese population, the awe-inspiring, pure white marble statue of Buddha is is the largest of its kind outside Myanmar. Surrounding the statue is a vibrant light that shrouds the entire space in a golden hue, creating a striking and beautiful image. Also of note is the traditional Burmese architecture at the temple\u2019s entrance, with gold embellishments topping off whitewashed walls.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nA striking Buddhist temple with all the classical hallmarks of Chinese architecture, this monastery is a perfect marriage of the Dharmic faith with Chinese features. The first thing you see upon entering is a statue of the bodhisattva (one who has attained enlightenment for the benefit of others) named Guanyin known as the Goddess of Mercy and revered in Mahayana Buddhism. She is seen as the feminine representation of Buddha and stands tall in the monastery, with her numerous divine hands jutting out at her sides. The building itself is painted in muted colours, which creates a sombre mood. Just beside it is a five-storey pagoda, whose top floor houses sacred relics belonging to the Buddha himself.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nHai Inn Temple is likely the most picturesque temple in Singapore, surrounded by lush greenery and nestled away from the city\u2019s hustle and bustle. Founded in 1928, the temple itself is far more modest than usual, renouncing the grandiloquent appearance of other Buddhist temples. The temple is famous for its Brahma Bell, one of the largest in Singapore \u2013 ringing it is believed to calm the souls trapped in Hell.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nBuddhist Temple\nThe Thian Hock Keng Temple is one of the oldest Chinese temples in Singapore, built in 1840 by the Hokkiens who hailed from the Fuzhou province. The temple is a showcase of southern Chinese architectural styles and assembled without the use of a single nail, with elaborate carvings covering the walls and roofs. Thian Hock Keng Temple was originally located along the coastline before land reclamation took place, and was the first port of call for new immigrants entering Singapore, giving thanks to their deities for helping them make the trip safely. The main deity is Mazu, the Goddess of the Seas, but the temple also encompasses Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism and ancestral worship.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nBuddhist Temple\nEssentially a Mahayana Buddhist temple but blending with Taoist and Confucian beliefs, Jin Long Si is worth the visit for its intricately carved reliefs and busts. The different corners of the buildings have huge dragons built on top of it, creating a beautifully animated space in one of the most decorative Buddhist temples in Singapore. The temple\u2019s 120-year-old Bodhi Tree is also a significant feature brought over by Sri Lankan monks. Its deep roots and historic significance means it\u2019s now a Heritage Tree and preserved without any alterations.\nLooks like it's closed Hours or services may be impacted due to Covid-19\nMore Info\nAtmosphere:\nIndoors\nThese recommendations were updated on August 30, 2018 to keep your travel plans fresh.\n"

            "Header Right\nGold galore, jaw-dropping artwork, 300-tonne statues and Buddha\u2019s tooth: we\u2019ve been on the temple trail around Singapore and have found 12 amazing temples to explore with the kids\nIf you are looking for some cultural fun with the kids , have grandparents in town who need entertaining with an interesting activity or two, or simply fancy adding some serious colour and history to your life, then maybe it\u2019s time you started exploring the beautiful Buddhist and Hindu temples to be found glittering all over the island. These 12 gems can be found in neighbourhoods all around Singapore, so gather the troops, bring the cameras and head off on a temple trail sure to wow the family\u2026\nSix unmissable Buddhist and Taoist temples\n1. Thian Hock Keng Temple\nWith its Southern Chinese architecture, Thian Hock Keng (pictured above) is one of the oldest Hokkien temples in Singapore \u2013 it was originally completed way back in 1842 (no, kids, we don\u2019t remember it being built). The main temple is dedicated to Ma Zu, the Taoist Goddess of the Sea (the area used to be a coastal road back before land reclamation started!), and the smaller temple at the back is dedicated to Guan Yin, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy.\n2. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum\nThe beautiful Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Singapore\u2019s Chinatown. Photography:\u00a0Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum \u4f5b\u7259\u5bfa via Facebook\nHead over to Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum for a visual feast and history lesson the whole family will love. While the temple may be the new kid on the block (it was only opened in 2007), it has fast become a focus for anyone heading to Chinatown. This is one of the best spots in Singapore to catch the celebrations on Vesak Day , one of the most important holy days to Buddhists around the world. The architecture was inspired by the Chinese Tang dynasty, and the temple was specifically constructed to house the tooth relic of Buddha (the tooth fairy didn\u2019t get that one, kids). Along with thousands of pieces of gorgeous artwork related to all things Lord Buddha, there is also a museum, a library, a garden, a vegetarian restaurant and a bookstore on site! Visitors are requested to come along dressed modestly (no mini-skirts or hotpants, folks).\n3. Wat Ananda Metyarama Thai Buddhist Temple\nWat Ananda has had a modern face-lift while still retaining its traditional Thai charm.\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you had teleported to Thailand when you visit the original part of this Thai Theravada Buddhist Temple, first constructed in 1925, but as you pass through the modern part of the building, it is clear to see why this amazing structure was nominated for the 2014 World Architecture Festival Awards. The new construction, completed in 2014, houses the new monks\u2019 quarters, meditation halls, classrooms and a museum. We are loving the traditional vs modern take at this seriously cool temple.\n4. Burmese Buddhist Temple\nBe wowed by a 10-tonne Buddha in marble at the Burmese Buddhist Temple.\nFew will fail to be impressed by the 10-tonne, 11-foot white marble Buddha statue residing at the Burmese Buddhist Temple, which arrived in Singapore from Mandalay in 1918 and boasts the worthy accolade of being the largest pure white marble statue of Buddha outside of Myanmar. Once you have been wowed by Buddha, check out the on-site Bodhi tree which can boast its origin back to the original Bodhi tree where Buddha attained enlightenment. Part of the temple dates back to 1875, which makes this pick the oldest Theravada Buddhist temple in Singapore.\n5. Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery\nTake in the old-school charm at Singapore\u2019s oldest monastery, Lian Shan Shuang Lin. Photography: Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery\nAlso known as Siong Lim Temple and Shuang Lin Temple, Lian Shan Shuang Lin Monastery is the oldest monastery in Singapore, having been completed originally in 1902. Architecture was modelled on the Xi Chang Shi Temple in Fuzhou, South China, and visitors fail to tire of the beautiful seven storey pagoda. The layout was designed in the traditional Heyuan Chinese courtyard style, and with three prayer halls, a rock garden, wall carvings and a collection of Bonsai trees, this is definitely a pick to get Instagram going into overdrive.\n6. Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple (Temple of 1000 Lights)\nSakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple is one of the most frequented Buddhist temples in Singapore. Photography: Elisa.rolle via Wiki Commons\nInfluenced by Thai Temple styles, the centrepiece of this temple is an unmissable 300-tonne, 15-foot statue of Buddha, surrounded by, you\u2019ve guessed it, 1,000 lights! The temple was created by Thai monks back in 1927, and visitors will also love other cool features including a huge Buddha footprint inlaid with mother-of pearl, a reclining Buddha and a heap of colourful murals telling the tales of Buddha as he searched for enlightenment. A wax model of Gandhi and figures of the Hindu elephant god Ganesh, can also be found onsite.\nSix unmissable Hindu temples\n1. Sri Mariamman Temple\nHead to Singapore\u2019s biggest and oldest temple, Sri Mariamman for a huge splash of colour and culture. Photography: Choo Yut Shing via Flickr\nThe biggest and oldest Hindu temple in Singapore is not to be found in Little India as you may imagine, but is instead nestled in Chinatown: Sri Mariamman Temple has been declared a National Monument, and is famous for its Fire Walking Ceremony (Theemithi), which will be held this year on 20 October as part of the Deepavali celebrations. Don\u2019t try this at home, kids! In addition to the festival, this place is well worth a visit any time of the year to feast your eyes on the Gopuram (pyramid style gate-way) which has no less than six layers of statues to welcome you through the gate. The temple, built in 1827, is dedicated to the Goddess of Rain, Mariamman: Don\u2019t forget to raise your eyes to the sky when looking around \u2013 the paintings on the ceiling are breathtaking!\n2. Sri Senpaga Vinayagar Temple\nWe get to marvel at the visual treat that is Sri Senpaga Vinayagar on the daily school run!\nThis temple is hard to miss with its five-tiered, 68 feet high golden entrance tower: And we get to walk past it most days on the school-run! The main prayer hall is centred around four granite pillars, each of which has eight sculptures of Lord Vinayagar depicted beautifully. The temple is managed by the Singapore Ceylon Tamils\u2019 Association, and visitors are welcomed warmly and encouraged to spend time taking in the paintings and carvings adorning the walls and ceilings, and getting a history lesson from friendly guides along the way.\n3. Sri Krishnan Temple (Sri Krishna Bagawan Temple)\nBuddhists and Hindus both have a place to worship at Sri Krishnan Begawan Temple. Photography: Choo Yut Shing via Flickr\nNot sure whether to visit a Hindu or a Buddhist temple? Tick both of your list with one visit at Sri Krishnan Temple, where there is an altar to the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy, Guanyin, as well as carvings and statues dedicated to the Hindu Gods. The temple was founded back in 1870 when a statue of Lord Krishna was placed under a banyan tree on Waterloo Street.\nSri Krishnan Temple , 152 Waterloo Street\n4. Sri Thendayuthapani Temple (Chettiars\u2019 Temple)\nCount all the colours on the beautiful Gopuram at Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. Photography: Choo Yut Shing via Flickr\nSri Thendayuthapani Temple, built in 1859, is the place to head to witness the Thaipusam festival in all its glory. Celebrated on the full moon day in January or February, the temple comes to life with a chariot procession and a toe-curling event where some devotees, wait for it, pierce themselves with spikes! Ow! The main deity of the temple is the six faced Lord Subramanian (Lord Murugan), and there\u2019s no missing this place with its amazing 75 feet tall blue Gopuram as its entrance.\n5. Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple\nStep inside Sri Veeramakaliamman and soak up the atmosphere in this unmissable temple. Photography: Choo Yut Shing via Flickr\nSri Veeramakaliamman Temple is a popular focal point in Little India, with the 14-handed Goddess Kali being the main deity. Kali is the Hindu Goddess who kicks evil to touch, and represents power and change. A woman after our own heart! The ceilings of the temple are covered with exquisite paintings and sculptures of various Gods, and the colourful outer roof is jam-packed with sculptures too.\n6. Sree Maha Mariamman Temple\nGold, gold and more gold: The glittering Sree Maha Mariamman Temple. Photography: Sree Maha Mariamman Temple\nIf you love a bit of gold then this is a sight to behold: Sree Maha Mariamman Temple has not one, not two, but three golden roof domes (vimanams) decorated with statues of the Goddess Mari in her 16 manifestations, as well as other Indian Gods. Murals, paintings, carvings and sculptures fill the temple for a visual feast that will have your camera going into overdrive.\nTracy Tristram\nTracy is a Brit mum to a grumpy teen, a sensitive tween and a very loud preschooler.

            "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nThis is a list of Hindu temples in Singapore . A characteristic of most temples is the presence of murtis (statues) of the Hindu deity to whom the temple is dedicated. They are usually dedicated to one primary deity, the presiding deity, and other deities associated with the main deity. However, some temples are dedicated to several deities, and others are dedicated to murtis in an aniconic form.

            "by Koh, Lay Tin\nThe Arts House (also known as the Old Parliament House) is where the Singapore Parliament used to sit. Located at Empress Place, it was originally built as a residence in 1827. After a series of major alterations and additions, possibly only the arches inside the porch are all that remain of the original building.1 The main building and the annex were gazetted as national monuments on 14 February 1992 and 26 June 1992, respectively. Together, they are now known as The Arts House, an arts venue.2\nHistory\nConstructed between 1826 and 1827, the former Parliament House was originally designed by colonial architect George D. Coleman to be the home of Scottish merchant, John Argyle Maxwell.3 Due to an administrative oversight, Maxwell\u2019s house became possibly the only home in an area designated for government buildings, based on the 1822 Raffles Town Plan . However, it was never used as a residential building.4\nIn June 1827, Maxwell rented the building to the government for use as a courthouse. It was then sold to George Gerald Larpent and John Cockrell on 1 September 1829.5 Additions were made to the building in 1839, including a single-storey extension that served as the new courthouse, while the front portion was occupied by public offices. In 1841, the East India Company purchased the building for 15,600 Spanish dollars.6\nIn 1847, the courthouse extension was enlarged to accommodate the Recorder, jurors and prisoners.7 The courthouse was later considered unsuitable as a court of justice, mainly because of the noise from the boatyard and blacksmith shop nearby. The courthouse moved out in 1865.8\nExtensions were made to the structure in 1875, 1901 and 1909. The buildings were eventually transformed, architecturally, from the Palladian style to Victorian.9\nAdditions made in 1875 included a long extension built along the Singapore River by colonial architect J. F. A. McNair . The main building then served as the Supreme Court until 1939, when the Supreme Court building was completed. Thereafter, Coleman\u2019s building served as a government storehouse and as the office of the Department of Social Welfare, before becoming semi-derelict. Renovations began in 1953 to restore the building for use by the Legislative Assembly, and the new Legislative Assembly House was opened in July 1954 by then Governor John Nicoll .10\nOn 5 June 1959, the building became known as the Parliament House, when the People\u2019s Action Party became the ruling party of a self-governing Singapore.11 The first parliamentary session was opened by then President Yusof bin Ishak on 8 December 1965.12 The building served as the Parliament House until 1999.13 With the opening of the new Parliament House at 1 Parliament Place in October 1999, Coleman\u2019s building became known as the Old Parliament House.14\nOn 26 March 2004, the Old Parliament House was reopened as The Arts House, a venue for the performing and visual arts.15 Renovations costing S$15 million saw the conversion of the building into an entertainment space and a 75-seat film theatrette, among other changes. The most historical space, the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of The Arts House, is the 150-seat concert chamber known as The Chamber.16 It is home to concert recitals, film screenings and art exhibitions.17\nAlong with the refurbishment of the main building, the annex (previously the courthouse) was also spruced up and now houses a restaurant.18 The renovations garnered the Old Parliament House a prize in the Urban Redevelopment Authority \u2019s Architectural Heritage Awards 2004 for its unique transformation whilst retaining its original charm.19\nTimeline\n1819: The site of the building is occupied by the temenggong of Johor and his followers.20\n1827: The two-storey mansion is completed. It is used as the first courthouse until 1865, when a new court building is constructed.\n1841: The government buys the building in an auction. It is used as a courthouse and then as public offices. It houses the Supreme Court until 1939. After World War II, it continues to be used by different government departments.21\n1875: The court returns to the building. After renovations, it is turned into the Supreme Court.\n1939: Serves as a government storehouse and offices for the Department of Social Welfare, with the completion of the new Supreme Court building.\n1953: Renovations begin to restore the building to be the new Legislative Assembly.\n1954: Renamed Legislative Assembly House, it is opened by Governor John Nicoll on 7 July.\n1965: Renamed Parliament of Singapore.\n1965\u201399: Serves as Parliament House.22\n2004: Former Parliament House reopens as The Arts House, a multidisciplinary arts centre.\nAuthor\nReferences\n2.

            "Merlion\nThe Merlion seen from its back with a view at the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands\nThe Merlion ( Malay : Singa-Laut, Chinese : \u9c7c\u5c3e\u72ee, Tamil : \u0bae\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd) is the official mascot of Singapore , depicted as a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish. Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both the city state and its people in sports teams, advertising, branding, tourism and as a national personification . [1]\nThe Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the tourism board.\nContents\nIts name combines \" mer \", meaning the sea , and \" lion \". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek , which means \"sea town\" in Javanese . The lion head represents Singapore's original name\u2014 Singapura \u2014meaning \"lion city\" or \"kota singa\".\nThe symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner , a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium , for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in use from 26 March 1964 to 1997 and has been its trademarked symbol since 20 July 1966. Although the STB changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol. [2] Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion appears frequently on STB-approved souvenirs .\nTogether with the Little Mermaid of Denmark and Manneken Pis of Belgium, the Singapore Merlion is ranked in Japan as the 'Three Major Disappointments of the World'. [3] [4] [5] [6] This meme was played out in episode 6 of the anime series A Place Further Than The Universe , when two of the characters expressed to their chagrin that the Merlion was not as disappointing as they thought.\nMerlion at the mouth of the Singapore River (original location).\nOn 15 September 1972, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew officiated the installation ceremony of the Merlion statue. [7] The original Merlion statue used to stand at the mouth of the Singapore River , at the tip of the Former Merlion Park with Anderson Bridge as its background.\nIt was conceptualised by the vice-chancellor of the University of Singapore (now known as National University of Singapore ) then, Kwan Sai Kheong. Made from November 1971 to August 1972 by the late Singapore sculptor, Lim Nang Seng ( Chinese : \u6797\u6d6a\u65b0; pinyin : L\u00edn L\u00e0ngx\u012bn), [8] it measures 8.6 metres high and weighs 70 tons. [7] [9] The project cost about S$ 165,000. [7]\nRelocation of original statue[ edit ]\nThe Merlion Park viewed with the Singapore skyline in the background\nThe completion of the Esplanade Bridge , in 1997, blocked the views of the Merlion from the Marina Bay waterfront. [7] By then, the original Merlion location was also no longer the entrance of Singapore River. [7] So, in 2002, the statue and its cub were relocated 120 metres to the current Merlion Park that fronts Marina Bay where it stands on a newly reclaimed promontory in front of The Fullerton Hotel .\nAnother solution considered\u2014to raise the Merlion on a pedestal at its original location\u2014was deemed unsuitable as the view would still be blocked by the bridge. Other possible relocation sites considered included Nicoll Highway Extension Bridge, Esplanade Park , Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay , a promontory at Marina Centre (near where Singapore Flyer is located now), a promontory site at Bayfront (near the tip of Marina Bay Sands integrated resort ) and Kim Seng Park. However, all were either unsuitable or not technically feasible. [7]\nThe unprecedented feat of relocation began on 23 April 2002, and finished on 25 April. A carefully engineered journey required one barge , two DEMAG AC1600S cranes of 5000 tonnes lifting capacity, plus a team of 20 engineers and workers on site. The entire statue was hoisted onto the barge, which then sailed to the new installation site at the current Merlion Park, near the mouth of Singapore River . During the voyage, the statue had to be hoisted from the barge, over the Esplanade Bridge and then back onto the barge, as it was too tall to pass underneath.\nExactly 30 years after it was officially launched, then- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew returned on 15 September 2002 to ceremonially welcome the Merlion again \u2013 this time in its new home. A viewing deck now stretches over the Singapore River, allowing visitors to pose for a photograph with a front or side view of the Merlion, including a new city skyline backdrop in the picture. The sculpture was aligned to face East, a direction advised to be most auspicious . [9] Relocated, the statue once more spouted water from its mouth, having stopped in its old location since 1998 due to a water pump malfunction. The Merlion now has a new two-unit water pump system with units working alternatively, so a partner is always on standby. The relocation and new site (four times larger than the original) cost S$ 7.5 million. [9]\nMaintenance of original statue[ edit ]\nFrom 5 June till 10 July 2006, the Merlion at Merlion Park underwent maintenance. The last one was right after its relocation. Dirt and stains were removed using high-pressure water streams, and various wear and tear of the statue was mended. [10]\nDuring that period, visitors were greeted with illustrated hoardings and canvases covering the safety nets and scaffolding . The illustrations [11] were designed by Miel , an award-winning senior artist at The Straits Times . The illustration on the canvases made them look like shower curtains , with the Merlion sticking its head out with the shadow of its tail behind the curtain. The illustration on the hoardings showed the Merlion scrubbing himself with a brush and showering using a Merlion shower head spouting water. The Merlion said \"EXCUSE ME while i take a shower...\" in a speech bubble .\nThe Merlion on Sentosa was designed and sculpted by an Australian Artist named James Martin. It is made of Glass Reinforced Cement (GRC) over a steel armature that is attached to the centre. [12]\nThe Merlion Park was temporarily turned into a single-unit hotel suite, as part of an artwork by Tatzu Nishi , for the duration of the 2011 Singapore Biennale . [13]\nDamage by lightning[ edit ]\nOn Saturday, 28 February 2009, at about 4:26\u00a0pm, the Merlion in the Merlion Park was struck by lightning. [14] A breaking news from 938NOW local radio showed an image with fragments from the Merlion's head on the ground.\nExamination of the damage was done quickly with wooden scaffolding set up on Sunday, 1 March 2009 for workers to take a closer look at the hole. The incident happened as a result of the lack of lightning protection on the Merlion itself. [15]\nMini Merlion\nThe Merlion Tourism Court\nWithin Singapore, there are six Merlion statues in Singapore which are approved by the STB. [16] [17]\nThe smaller two-metre-tall statue standing behind the original statue, weighed 3 ton and was commonly referred to as the \u201cMerlion cub\u201d. It was inlaid with Chinese porcelain plates and bowls as part of its design. [19]\nThe three-metre-tall glazed polymarble statue at Tourism Court (near Grange Road) completed in 1995\nThe three-metre-tall polymarble statue placed on Mount Faber 's Faber Point\nA pair of Merlion statues were constructed by the Ang Mo Kio Residential Committee in 1999. Those sit at the entrance of the car park along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. [20]\nOne of the previously approved statutes, a 37-metre-tall gigantic replica at Sentosa , with Mouth Gallery Viewing Deck on the ninth storey, another viewing gallery on its head and Sentosa Merlion Shop, and capable of shining laser beams from its eyes, [21] was closed on 20 October 2019. [22] The area around the statue would be replaced by a S$ 90 million Sentosa Sensoryscape project targeted to be completed by 2022. [22]\nThe statues can also be found outside of Singapore in various countries, namely Indonesia , Japan , South Korea , and Thailand . [23]\nThe Merlion in art and popular culture[ edit ]\nEdwin Thumboo 's poem on display beside the Merlion statue\nIn TV series[ edit ]\nThe Merlion (Japanese: \u30de\u30fc\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa\u30f3) appeared in the influential anime Cowboy Bebop (episodes 18 and 24), where its appearance in an ancient home movie offers Singaporean amnesiac bounty hunter Faye Valentine a clue to her true origins.\nThe Merlion featured heavily in Hajime Sat\u014d's (\u4f50\u85e4\u3000\u8087, Sat\u014d Hajime) re-imagining of Shinjuku in the 2005 anime, Karas .\nThe Merlion is featured in episode 11 of Japanese light novel , Seitokai no Ichizon .\nThe Merlion is seen in special episode 1 of the manga, Hidamari Sketch .\nThe Merlion appears when the lady landlord is searching for an apartment key in Episode 10 of Hidamari Sketch X: \"Hoshimittsu\".\nThe Merlion was used in an exclamation by Kyoko Toshino in episode 8 of YuruYuri in response to seeing Chizuru Ikeda drooling.\nIn Phineas and Ferb 's \"Summer Belongs To You!\", The Merlion was seen when the gang was bouncing around the world in a large rubber ball.\nIn the anime Beelzebub , Tatsuya Himekawa had merlion decorations in his house\nThe Amazing Race 25 requires teams to search for a clue box in one of five official Merlions in Singapore (Tourism Court, Mount Faber , Sentosa and two in Merlion Park ) where only the Merlion in Mount Faber has it.\nThe Merlion is seen in episode 1 of the 2013 anime television series, Valvrave the Liberator .\nThe Merlion is featured in episode 17 of anime television series, Blast of Tempest .\nThe Merlion appears in episode 70 of Cardfight!! Vanguard: Asia Circuit .\nThe Merlion was briefly seen in episode 52 of Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V .\nThe Merlion and its supposed history are explained in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure : Stardust Crusaders in episode 7 of the series.\nOn TLC reality series Cake Boss , a cake was made in shape of The Merlion to commemorate Singapore's 50th Anniversary, incorporating flavors that are typically used in Singaporean desserts.\nIn episode 2 of Konohana Kitan , Yuzu exclaims \"Merlion!\" and mimics its water spout after she is pulled into the hot springs bath by Satsuki.\nIn We Bare Bears 's episode titled \"Lil' Squid\", a Merlion statue makes an appearance in the aquarium which the bear cubs enter.\nThe Merlion can also be seen in the popular video game Animal Crossing for the Nintendo GameCube , and its sequels, as a decoration.\nThe Merlion can be summoned in the DS game, Scribblenauts and Super Scribblenauts.\nThe Merlion can be bought as a cash item and be used as a mount in Ragnarok 2: Advent of Valkyrie.\nThe Merlion is also featured in one of the Alien Egg miracle cards of the English version of Animal Kaiser .\nMerlion Virtual Airlines, virtually based in Singapore, is a virtual airline focusing on the free flight simulator, FlightGear , which uses the Merlion as its logo.\nEdwin Thumboo cemented the iconic status of the Merlion as a personification of Singapore with his poem \"Ulysses by the Merlion\" in 1979. Due to Thumboo's status as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate and the nationalistic mythmaking qualities of his poetry, future generations of Singaporean poets have struggled with the symbol of the Merlion, frequently taking an ironical, critical, or even hostile stand \u2013 and pointing out its artificiality and the refusal of ordinary Singaporeans to accept a tourist attraction as their national icon. The poem \"attracted considerable attention among subsequent poets, who have all felt obliged to write their own Merlion (or anti-Merlion) poems, illustrating their anxiety of influence, as well as the continuing local fascination with the dialectic between a public and a private role for poets, which Thumboo (as Yeats before him, in the Irish context) has wanted to sustain as a fruitful rather than a tense relation between the personal and the public.\" Among the poems of this nature are \"Merlign\" by Alvin Pang and \"Love Song for a Merlion\" by Vernon Chan. More recent poems include \"Merlion: Strike One\" by Koh Buck Song in the 2009 anthology, Reflecting on the Merlion.\nMerlions as a species were fictional characters in Gwee Li Sui 's Myth of the Stone (1993), the first full-length graphic novel published in Singapore. They were depicted as calm and wise creatures that fought on the side of good and eventually overcame the dreaded Kraken . Gwee further popularised the iconoclastic image of the spitting Merlion in the early 1990s. It reappeared later with his well-loved poem \"Propitiations\" in his book of poems Who Wants to Buy a Book of Poems? (1998).\nAs mascots and performance characters[ edit ]\nFor the inaugural Singapore 2010 Summer Youth Olympics , a pair of mascots, Lyo and Merly , were introduced. Merly is a \"Merlion-ess cub\" based on the Merlion. Her hair is inspired by the lion top half while her fish half is represented in light-blue scales on her body. Unlike the actual merlion, she has hands and legs instead of a tailfin.\nThe 37m-tall Sentosa Merlion appeared in the Magical Sentosa show, awakening at the last scene of the show and shining two laser beams out of its eyes at the audience. (Similar to the storyline of the Songs of the Sea show.)\nThe popular Instagram plushie MerRyan is a merlion.\nIn local parlance[ edit ]\nSingaporeans often substitute the term \"Merlion\" in lieu of vomiting , in reference of the constant gushing of water from the Merlion's mouth. [24] It is now used by Singaporean medical staff as slang for a patient who has intractable vomiting.\nA small Merlion, complete with a plaque giving information about the original statues, forms part of the decoration in the \"Mystic East\" area of British theme park Chessington World of Adventures .\nThe Merlion was featured\u2013 or, depending on point of view, not featured\u2013 during the 2005 Venice Biennale in the controversial work Mike by artist Lim Tzay Chuen. He had proposed taking the sculpture in the Merlion Park to the Singapore Pavilion at the exhibition, [25] but was refused by the authorities.\nGo-Ahead Singapore uses the Merlion as part of its logo.\n\"Archived copy\" .

            "by Yong Chun Yuan\nThe Merlion is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish.1 Regarded as a Singapore icon, the Merlion was designed in 1964 for the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB; now known as the Singapore Tourism Board ) and functioned as its logo from 1964 to 1997.2 There are\u00a0seven authorised Merlion statues in Singapore,3 the most well-known being an 8-metre-tall statue designed by Kwan Sai Kheong and sculpted by Lim Nang Seng.4 First unveiled on 15 September 1972,5 this statue is now located at the new Merlion Park, adjacent to One Fullerton at the Marina Bay waterfront.6 As a symbol representing Singapore, the Merlion features prominently in tourist souvenirs sold locally.7\nOrigins\nThe emblem\u2019s concept was first devised in 1963 for the STPB by Fraser Brunner, curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium .8 Later named the \u201cMerlion\u201d, its registration as a trademark of the STPB was finalised on 20 July 1966, granting the board exclusive rights to use the symbol.9\nUsing the fish in its design alludes to the idea of Singapore\u2019s beginnings as a fishing village, while the lion refers to the sighting of a lion in Temasek by a prince from Palembang, Sang Nila Utama , as narrated in the Sejarah Melayu, leading him to rename the island\u00a0Singapura\u00a0(\u201clion city\u201d in Sanskrit).10\nWhile STPB encouraged the commercialisation of the Merlion including through approved souvenirs,11 members of the public are not allowed to produce artefacts featuring the Merlion or anything that resembles it without first seeking permission from the board. According to the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board Act, failure to comply with these regulations could result in a fine of not exceeding S$1,000. \u00a0Although the STPB was renamed Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and the board replaced the Merlion as its corporate logo on 19 November 1997,12 the popularity of the Merlion continues and STB had admitted that it was not possible to keep track of all Merlion reproductions.13\nApproved Merlion statues\nIn Singapore, there are\u00a0seven Merlion statues that have been built with approval from the STB. The two most well-known statues are located at the new Merlion Park next to One Fullerton. Designed to project seawater from its mouth, the larger statue weighs 70 t and stands at 8 m,14 reinforced by a 0.6-metre concrete beam beneath it.15 The smaller statue is 2 m tall, weighs 3 t and is commonly referred to as the \u201cMerlion cub\u201d. It is inlaid with Chinese porcelain plates and bowls as part of its design.16\nThe two statues were originally constructed from November 1971 to August 197217 by local sculptor Lim Nang Seng, based on a blueprint by artist Kwan Sai Kheong, the late Ambassador to the Philippines and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Singapore from 1975 to 1980.18 After completion, the two statues were unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as part of the waterfront Merlion Park located at the mouth of the Singapore River .19\nWith the completion of Esplanade Bridge in 1997, the Merlion statues could no longer be viewed clearly from the waterfront. In 2002, the STB decided to relocate the statues to a new pier specially built on the other side of Esplanade Bridge, overlooking Marina Bay .20 This relocation, and the subsequent extension of the Merlion Park by up to four times its previous area, cost a total of S$7.5 million.21 The move started on 23 April 200222 and finished on 28 April 2002.23 The then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew unveiled the statue at its new spot at One Fullerton on 15 September 2002,24 in a simple ceremony that also celebrated the Merlion\u2019s 30th birthday.25 In its new location, the Merlion statue faces east as it did in the old location to preserve the optimal feng shui (Chinese geomancy).26\nOver the years, the statue\u2019s pump system has broken down periodically due to corrosion from exposure to seawater and subsequently replaced.27 On 28 February 2009, the larger statue was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm, causing a crack in the Merlion\u2019s mane, and a hole at the base of the statue due to falling debris.28 The statue was repaired and reopened for public viewing on 18 March 2009.29\nCompleted in 1996, the Merlion tower on Sentosa is a 37-metre 12-storey structure. It costs S$8 million and was designed by Australian sculptor James Martin.30\nAnother Merlion statue is located outside the STB\u2019s office at Tourism Court. Made in the Philippines from glazed polymarble, it is 3 m tall. A similar statue can be found on Faber Point at Mount Faber . It is owned by the National Parks Board and was installed in 1998, following the redevelopment of the park.\nMerlions in Singapore literature\nThe Merlion has also inspired several works by local poets, among them Ulysses by the Merlion by Edwin Thumboo , and The Merlion to Ulysses composed by Lee Tzu Pheng as a response to Thumboo.31 These and other poems dedicated to the Merlion have been collated into an anthology titled Reflecting on the Merlion published in 2009.32\nAuthor\nReferences\n2.

            "by Cornelius-Takahama, Vernon\nThe Istana is the official residence of the president of Singapore . Spanning over 40 ha, it is located along Orchard Road, Singapore\u2019s prime shopping district.1 The present structure was designed and built by John Frederick Adolphus McNair in 1869,2 and originally served as the residence of the governor of the Straits Settlements and later the governor of the Colony of Singapore.3 Previously known as Government House, The Istana was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992.4\nHistory\nBuilt shortly after Stamford Raffles had set up a trading post in Singapore in 1819, the first Government House was a wooden house with a thatched roof located on Bukit Larangan (Forbidden Hill; known today as Fort Canning Hill ). The Government House was later extended, and redesigned in the neoclassical style by George Dromgold Coleman , Singapore\u2019s pioneer colonial architect, before it was demolished in 1859.5\nIn 1867, with an initial sum of $100,000 approved by the Legislative Council, then Governor of the Straits Settlements Harry Ord purchased 106 ac (about 43 ha) of land belonging to merchant Charles Robert Prinsep, which was part of his nutmeg plantation, to build a new Government House.6 With colonial engineer McNair at the helm, construction of the new Government House (the current Istana) began that same year, with the foundation stone laid by Lady Ord in July 1867.7 Convict labourers from India, Ceylon and Hong Kong were brought in to work on the project. For 20 cents a day, these labourers served as stone masons, stone cutters, plumbers, carpenters and painters.8\nAs it was later decided that the building should be larger than the original plan, there was insufficient budget to complete the final phase of the construction. Fortunately, in February 1869, the Legislative Council approved an additional sum of $40,000 requested by McNair to finish the project. The building was finally completed in October 1869 at a total cost of $185,000, just in time for the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to Singapore.9\nThe Government House became the official residence of colonial governors, housing a total of 21 governors during colonial rule in Singapore.10 It was renamed Istana Negara Singapura (Palace of the State of Singapore) in 1959 when Singapore gained self-government. The name was shortened to The Istana when Singapore became a sovereign republic in 1965.11\nDescription\nA well-proportioned building in the shape of a cross,12 The Istana\u2019s architecture is similar to many 18th-century neo-Palladian buildings in India designed by British military engineers. Its layout includes features typical of Malay houses, such as wide verandahs, large louvred windows and panelled doors to improve ventilation and thus result in a cool, airy interior.13 The dwarfed piers and arches, which resemble stilts, elevate the structure of the building and thus help to provide the interior with the needed ventilation suitable for Singapore\u2019s tropical weather.14 Dominating the entire structure is a central three-storey tower.15\nThe Istana underwent extensive renovation between 1996 to 1998 to create more room for state functions as well as to upgrade its mechanical and electrical services. The building currently has six function rooms used for various ceremonies and for guests\u2019 accommodation.16\nWithin the Istana grounds are three other buildings: Sri Temasek (1869), which was originally built as a residence for the colonial secretary and now functions as the official residence of the prime minister,17 Istana Villa (1938) and the Lodge (1974).18 The Istana grounds is open to the public during the following public holidays: Chinese New Year , Deepavali , Hari Raya Puasa , Labour Day and National Day .19\nAuthor\nReferences\n1.

            "Designer\nConstructed by\nSato Kogyo Pte Ltd and TTJ Design and Engineering Pte Ltd\nConstruction start\nOpened\n24\u00a0April 2010; 10 years ago (2010-04-24)\nThe Helix Bridge, officially The Helix, [1] and previously known as the Double Helix Bridge, is a pedestrian bridge linking Marina Centre with Marina South in the Marina Bay area in Singapore . It was officially opened on 24 April 2010 at 9 pm; however, only half was opened due to ongoing construction at the Marina Bay Sands. [1] It is located beside the Benjamin Sheares Bridge and is accompanied by a vehicular bridge, known as the Bayfront Bridge . The entire bridge was opened on 18 July 2010 to complete the entire walkway around Marina Bay.\nContents\nThe design consortium is an international team comprising Australian architects the Cox Architecture and engineers Arup , and Singapore based Architects 61. [2]\nCanopies (made of fritted-glass and perforated steel mesh) are incorporated along parts of the inner spiral to provide shade for pedestrians. The bridge has four viewing platforms sited at strategic locations which provide stunning views of the Singapore skyline and events taking place within Marina Bay. [3] At night, the bridge will be illuminated by a series of lights that highlight the double-helix structure, thereby creating a special visual experience for the visitors. [4]\nPairs of coloured letters c and g, as well as a and t on the bridge which are lit up at night in red and green represent cytosine , guanine , adenine and thymine , the four bases of DNA . The intentional left handed DNA-like design, which is the opposite of normal DNA on earth, earned it a place in The Left Handed DNA Hall of Fame in 2010. [5]\nThe Land Transport Authority claimed it is a world first in architectural and engineering bridge design. [6] It won the 'World's Best Transport Building' award at the World Architecture Festival Awards in the same year. It has also been recognised by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) at the BCA Design and Engineering Safety Excellence Awards in 2011.\nFrom the outset, the project posed several challenges. There was a desire for the plan view of the bridge to be curved in an arc, such that it joins the foreshore promenades on either side seamlessly. Furthermore, it was desirable to create a lightweight structure, in contrast to the adjacent 6-lane vehicle bridge which is rather heavy in appearance.\nDue to the tropical climate, the brief also required the bridge to provide shade and shelter against direct sunshine and heavy rainfall. The combination of these factors, together with the desire to create a landmark structure, led to a novel and unique design. The bridge was designed using BS 5950 [7] in combination with a design guide from the SCI. [8]\nThe resulting bridge comprises two delicate helix structures that act together as a tubular truss to resist the design loads. This approach was inspired by the form of the curved DNA structure. The helix tubes only touch each other in one position, under the bridge deck. The two spiraling members are held apart by a series of light struts and rods, as well as stiffening rings, to form a rigid structure. This arrangement is strong and ideal for the curved form. The stainless steel bridge is met by concrete abutments at either side.\nThe 280 m bridge is made up of three 65 m spans and two 45 m end spans. If the steel were stretched out straight from end to end, it would measure 2.25\u00a0km in length. The major and minor helices, which spiral in opposite directions, have an overall diameter of 10.8 m and 9.4 m respectively, about 3 stories high. The outer helix is formed from six tubes (273\u00a0mm in diameter) which are set equidistant from one another. The inner helix consists of five tubes, also 273\u00a0mm in diameter. Over the river, the bridge is supported by unusually light tapered stainless steel columns, which are filled with concrete. The columns form inverted tripod shapes which support the bridge above each of the pilecaps. The bridge weighs around 1700 tonnes in total.\nThe final pieces of the design are a series of ovular-shaped cantilevered viewing 'pods', each with capacity for about 100 people, that extend out on the bay side to create 'ring-side' viewing for water events. These decks are also constructed using grade 1.4462 and are designed to further optimize the pedestrian experience of the bridge as a new urban place and a vital connection between Singapore's major existing and emerging urban precincts.\nThe DNA-like design of the Helix Bridge\nBecause this structure was inspired by the DNA structure , it appeared essential that the architectural lighting features should emphasise the various shapes and curves. Towards that end, a series of dynamic multi-coloured light-emitting diode (LED) lights are installed on the helix structures. Outward-facing lights accentuate the sweeping structural curves, with another discreet array of lights illuminating the internal canopy of glass and steel mesh to create a dynamic membrane of light. The inner helix uses white light to illuminate a path for pedestrians. The lights work particularly well with the surface finish and colour of the stainless steel elements. [9]\nExtensive numerical analysis was completed in order to explore possible solutions, using the engineer's in-house structural optimisation software. This enabled a method to be found of linking the two helices. It also ensured that the steel sections are used to their maximum capacity in supporting the pedestrian deck, shade canopies and light fixtures. Prior to specifying materials, or even finalising the designs, the bridge was fully modelled using three-dimensional software in order to visualise its form and geometrical compatibility, as well as to visualise the pedestrian experience on the bridge.\nNon-linear analysis was also carried out to assess the response under various load cases and to analyse the serviceability requirements such as vibration. It was also important to carry out robustness studies in order to examine the behaviour that would arise if the structure were subjected to accidental or deliberate removal of a helix or supporting member. [10]\nThe Helix is fabricated from approximately 650 tonnes of Duplex Stainless Steel and 1000 tonnes of carbon steel used in the temporary structure and also helping the bridge to get the helix shape. The construction began in 2007. It was partially opened on April 24th 2010 at 9:00pm and fully opened on July 18th 2010. [11]\nBefore any work began on the actual bridge, a mock-up was made of carbon steel to try and preempt certain difficulties. Fabrication of the elements worked from the North to the South, components being assembled into segments that could manage the Singapore roads. A trial assembly was done before delivery to site to identify any prefabrication errors. [12]\nThe duplex stainless steel used is susceptible to contamination by carbon or zinc dust. So a dedicated workshop was specially set up to keep members for the Helix separate from other carbon and nitrogen steels. [12]\nA temporary truss bridge was built to support the bridge and provide access. The key issue was in launching the trusses over the central 50m wide navigation channel that had to be kept clear during construction to give safe access to other users of the bay.\nThe truss was launched in segments in a synchronised lift with two mobile crane units. This was done at night to minimise disturbance caused by closing the channel. [12]\nA mobile gantry crane was positioned on the temporary bridge to lift elements into place. Erection started from the North Abutment starting with the horizontal prefabricated segments (av. 11m long). Then the horizontal deck components were bolted on, and then cross members, hoop members, tension rods, and other loose members were installed working upwards from deck level.\nThe helices and their struts were installed. The individual elements of the helices being welded on the entire span had been erected. These crucial connections were very closely supervised and controlled to ensure the properties of the duplex steel were maintained. Finally a passivation process removed any surface iron compounds which are a potential source of corrosion.

(Photo: Jeremy Long)\nHowever, the present Elgin Bridge has an equivalent claim to fame - it stands at the site of the\u00a0first footbridge to be built in Singapore (around the 1820s, and so earlier than the Cavenagh Bridge). It is the fifth bridge and second \"Elgin Bridge\" to be built on the site.\nMADE IN BRITAIN\nThe structural components of the three bridges were manufactured in Britain and then shipped to Singapore.\nThe engineers involved were also British, as were the bridges' namesakes.\nCavenagh Bridge was named after Sir William Orfeur Cavenagh, the governor of the Straits Settlements at the time.\nAnderson Bridge was named after Sir John Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner of the Federated Malay States, while Elgin Bridge was named after Lord James Bruce Elgin, Governor General of India from 1862 to 1863.\nView of Elgin Bridge and Marina Bay Sands.\u00a0(Photo: Jeremy Long)\nNO CATTLE AND HORSES, PLEASE\nFollowing the opening of Anderson Bridge, heavy traffic was diverted away from its older sibling, which was converted into a pedestrian-only bridge.\nKeen-eyed members of the public crossing\u00a0Cavenagh Bridge will be able to spot antique signs at the end of the bridge prohibiting \"any vehicle of which the laden weight exceeds 3 cwt and to all cattle and horses\".\nSomething to bear in mind next time you cross.\nTRIBUTES TO ENGINEERS ... AND LIONS\nApart from bans on cattle and horses, the bridges also feature tributes to their engineers.\nCavenagh Bridge has steel plates emblazoned with its engineers' names.\nMeanwhile, Elgin Bridge has bronze plaques engraved with lion symbols.\nLions didn't quite make it for the Anderson Bridge - its original design featured a pair of bronze lions, but these were eventually left out for reason of economy, according to the National Library Board.\nHowever, the bridge does have a plaque made of red granite imported from Aswan, Egypt.\nView of Anderson Bridge. (Photo: Jeremy Long)\nBUILT BY CONVICTS\nAmid its status as the oldest bridge across the Singapore River,\u00a0Cavenagh Bridge also has a more sombre past.\nIt was built by convicts from India, with the NLB describing it as the \"last major project undertaken by Indian convict labour\".\nAccording to the board, Singapore began receiving Indian convicts from British India from 1825 to serve out their sentences, to assist with a labour shortage and development requirements.\nCavenagh Bridge was one of the monuments, bridges and other infrastructure built by convict labour in Singapore.\nInvalid email address\nIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.\nTry Again\nThis service is not intended for persons residing in the EU.

            "The \u2018Straits Times Overland\u2019 reported on 15 March 1879:\n\u201cOn Thursday Afternoon (13 March) eight tons of   powder were exploded on Mount Siloso, Blakang Mati, in connection with   the defences of the port under the superintendence of Lieutenants   McCallum R.E. and Rhodes R.E., a large number of residents, military, official, and civil being present as spectators.\u201d\nWork had started on Fort Siloso. A coast battery destined to see action in the Second World War, and to be the last active coast battery in Singapore.\nThe Importance of Fort Siloso\nFrom: Report on defences of British coaling stations\nabroad and of Colonial and Indian defended ports. 1894\nFrom when Singapore became a British colony, many gun batteries were built to defend New Harbour (later Keppel Harbour) and the 20th Century naval base from a seaborne attack. Of these, only Fort Siloso, on the western tip of Blakang Mati (Sentosa) was restored to a semblance of what it once was. There are remains of some of the other batteries, but others have completely disappeared\nOf the remaining batteries, Mount Imbiah Battery is in very good  condition, as in Labrador Park are substantial remains of Fort Pasir Panjang and Batu Berlayar AMTB Battery. There are also some visible remains of Labrador Battery. With the exception of Batu Berlayar Battery which is gated, these batteries are easily accessible. There are, for the explorer, remains of several other batteries to be found on Singapore, but caution needs to be exercised when visiting them. Some are in very poor order, and can be hazardous to visitors. There may be more remaining than many people think, although some of these remains are in restricted areas, or otherwise are inaccessible. Reference is made to some such areas in this website.\nThe word \u2018Fort\u2019 is something of a misnomer when applied to Siloso and other gun batteries in Singapore. Only Fort Tanjong Katong was built as a stand-alone defensible gun battery. This because of it's location, which was a little remote when it was constructed.\nVisiting Fort Siloso\nAdmission to the fort is free, and there are guides for visitors who wish to make pay for a guided tour. Inside the fort is the Surrender Chamber, in which are displays of the British Surrender in February 1942, and of the Japanese Surrender at City Hall in September 1945. Entry to the Surrender Chamber is free.\nFort Siloso in Google Street View\n. Peter W. Stubbs\nThe photographs in this website have been taken over a period of many years. The various colour schemes adopted by the owners of the Fort may appear in a particular sequence of photos. The Fort was painted in a camouflage scheme during WWII and later. this is seen in some photos.\nNOTE: This website is a personal one, and is not in any way, connected with the Sentosa Leisure Group, who manage Fort Siloso. I am therefore unable to assist with, or reply to, requests for photography, filming, guided tours etc. Any such requests should be made to the Sentosa Development Corporation. www.sentosa.com.sg .\n"

Other galleries in the ACM include the Ancient Religions Gallery and the Scholar in Chinese Culture gallery.\nThe ACM is far more than just a spectacular history lesson. Expect programmes like the annual River Nights, where you can connect closely with culture and the arts.\nAfter marvelling at all that history, you can also take time to reflect with a bite at Priv\u00e9 Caf\u00e9 @ ACM or Cantonese restaurant, Empress .

            "Published\nThese are disturbing times.\nA new contemporary art exhibition at The Parkview Museum in North Bridge Road explores just that - featuring works by more than 30 international artists who have dug their nails into the unsettling and irritating aspects of life.\nDisturbing Narratives, now showing on the third floor of the Art Deco-inspired Parkview Square, is an eclectic range of intriguing, provoking works that elude interpretation.\nLife-sized skeletons by German artist Gloria Friedmann engage in a danse macabre against a \"blood\"- splattered backdrop.\nGolem-like sculptures by Austrian artist Lois Weinberger suggest pagan rituals of fertility, death and resurrection.\nSouth Korean painter Yoo Geun-taek's works depict library scenes ridden with enigmatic clouds, little fires and banal objects.\nThe artworks in the 1,500 sq m space explore a diverse range of media, from paintings to sculptures to video installations.\nVIEW IT / DISTURBING NARRATIVES\nWHERE: The Parkview Museum, Level 3 Parkview Square, 600 North Bridge Road\nWHEN: Till Feb 8 next year, Mondays to Saturdays, noon to 7pm\nADMISSION: Free\nINFO: www.parkviewmuseum.com\nCurator Lorand Hegyi, the museum's art director, says: \"Don't look for any formal, stylistic (or) linguistic coherence. There are very different (artistic) positions, not only from the point of view of different generations, nations and cultures, but also very different formal languages.\n\"Our title, Disturbing Narratives, also reflects today's situation - we don't have any more clear lines, be it ideological, philosophical, political or economic.\"\nThe artworks are on loan from the collections of galleries, private collectors and the artists.\nParticularly memorable is an installation by Spanish artist Bernardi Roig, who has presented white, statuesque figures - made from the casts of real people - that seem muzzled and blinded by tubes of white neon lights.\n\"The sensation is (that) of a claustrophobic labyrinth. The material work is the light and the space... the figures are only an 'excuse',\" says Roig.\nHis work obliquely responds to that of early Baroque painter Caravaggio, who was known for his dramatic play of light and shadow.\nThe Parkview Museum was established by the late Hong Kong real-estate mogul and art collector George Wong, whose father founded the Parkview Group.\nDisturbing Narratives is the third in a series of thematic exhibitions at the museum - beginning two years ago with The Artist's Voice, which featured work by prominent artists such as Marina Abramovic, followed by Intriguing Uncertainties, a showcase of contemporary drawings.\nHegyi, a noted Hungarian art historian and critic, adds that a fourth exhibition in the series, slated for early next year, will shine the spotlight on \"fragile, empathetic, emotional micro-situations\".\nSix works to look out for\n1 SOCIETY OF ENEMIES AND FRIENDS (2019)\nThis danse macabre of seven life-sized skeletons is the work of German artist Gloria Friedmann. Each of the figures in the installation has a dangerously sharp, long \"nose\" which calls to mind fairy-tale character Pinocchio. Every skeleton is paired with a cow skull. A wall image showing a man walking around a clock alludes to the merciless passage of time.\n2 RIOT (THE TWO TOWERS) (2016/2019)\nTwo seemingly disorderly towers of chairs and sculptures of dogs - devoid of eyes and ears - stand in opposition to each other in the gallery, inviting viewers to contemplate, among other things, the relationship between humans and nature. The installation by Italian artist Paolo Grassino (above) is made of synthetic sponge on polystyrene, resins and wooden chairs.\n3 SCULPTURE IN 2 PIECES (2018)\nTwo flabby, bespectacled men stand facing each other in this mixed media, a provoking work by Swiss conceptual artist Urs Luthi, who explores ideas of the ego and alter ego. There is something uncanny here - the men, who are otherwise identical, have extra arms and legs.\n4 A PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS (2009)\nRussian artist Olga Tobreluts (above), a pioneer of the digital art movement in her country, presents a series of photographs and a video piece drawing on the historical relationship between Russia and the Caucasus.\n5 PAINTING ACTIONS\nThese paint-splattered canvases, shrine and a shirt, evoking the image of a cross, are the creation of Austrian artist Hermann Nitsch, who is known to feature elements of paganism and sacrifice in his art. The display includes his 39th Painting Action and 40th Painting Action, which both date back to 1997.\n6 THE GHOST OF HISTORY, 59 GRAINS OF CLAY (2016)\nThese disembodied heads in Italian artist Andrea Fogli's work are sculpted from terracotta and feature a range of faces that invite feelings of empathy. Who are these people - are they migrants, war victims or the forgotten?\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on July 02, 2019, with the headline 'Trying art'.

            "One of the entrances to the Battle Box museum\nHeadquarters Malaya Command Operations Bunker\nLocation in Singapore\nCoordinates\nContents\nGiven its position in the western Pacific ocean, Singapore had long been recognised as being strategically important for the Royal Navy to counter the growing influence of the Japanese, who were regarded as being the logical threat to Britain's interests in the Far East and the Pacific. To counter this, the Admiralty devised the Singapore strategy , which required a well equipped naval base. [1] Accordingly, the Singapore Naval Base was constructed on the north shore of Singapore Island. The base, and its associated defences, required a large British military presence on the island. [2]\nFort Canning Hill was used by the British Army as their headquarters in Singapore, with a number of buildings built for this purpose in the 1920s. However, the lack of a headquarters combining all three services present in Singapore \u2013 the Army , Royal Navy and Royal Air Force \u2013 was appreciated in 1936 by the then Colonel Arthur Percival , the Chief of Staff to General Dobbie , 'General Officer Commanding, Malaya'. To remedy this, a Combined Operations Headquarters was proposed for Fort Canning. [3]\nFort Canning Hill is a small hill in the Central Area of Singapore Island. Stamford Raffles had built a residence there in 1823, but when the Straits Settlement , which included Singapore, became a crown colony in 1867, a fort was constructed on the hill. [4] However, by the turn of the century, the construction of other defences around Singapore rendered the Fort Canning fortifications surplus to requirements. [5]\nLocated nearly 30 feet beneath the hill, the Fort Canning Bunker, also known as the Headquarters Malaya Command Operations Bunker, [6] was constructed in 1936 and completed by 1941. Sources vary as to the number of rooms in the bunker; one states 22, [7] while another, authored by the journalist who rediscovered the Battle Box, claims 29 rooms. [3] The bunker was constructed with one metre thick (3 feet) reinforced concrete walls to withstand direct hits from bombs and shells. [7] The complex included a telephone exchange connected to all military and most civilian switchboards in Malaya, [8] various signals and operations rooms, sleeping quarters and latrines. The bunker also included a cipher room for coding and decoding messages, but by the time of the fall of Malaya, this work had been shifted elsewhere and the cipher room was used as sleeping quarters. [9] The Commander of Fixed Defences, Brigadier Curtis, co-ordinated the coastal artillery strikes on naval targets from the bunker. [10]\nWorld War Two[ edit ]\nBy 1941, the bunker was considered to be too small for its intended use. [11] Percival, having returned to Malaya as a lieutenant general and 'General Officer Commanding, Malaya', authorised construction of a new Combined Operations Headquarters at the Royal Air Force headquarters in Sime Road. The construction of this new headquarters began in 1941, and was finished in December of that year. Although Combined Operations Headquarters had been relocated to Sime Road, the Fort Canning Bunker remained the Headquarters of Major General Frank Keith Simmons , who as the 'Fortress Commander, Singapore', was responsible for the defence of Singapore Island. The Anti-Aircraft Gun Operations Room and Naval Extended Defences offices also remained at the bunker. [12]\nThe Japanese invaded Malaya on 8 December 1941 by moving south through Siam (now known as Thailand ), as well as by making landings at Kota Baharu , on the north east coast of Malaya. [13] Rapidly retreating through Malaya, Allied forces were forced back to Singapore Island by 31 January 1942. [14] On 8 February, Japanese troops then crossed the Straits of Johor at the Battle of Sarimbun Beach on the north-west coast of Singapore Island, followed by a second landing near the Kranji River, at the Battle of Kranji .\nThe Sime Road location had to be abandoned during the Battle of Kranji , [15] with Lieutenant-General Percival shifting the Combined Operations Headquarters to Fort Canning Bunker on 11 February 1942. [16] By the latter stages of the battle for Singapore, the Japanese were bombing the Central Area of Singapore, including Fort Canning Hill, at will. Fort Canning Hill was also within range of the Japanese artillery, forcing personnel into the bunker. There were around 500 officers and men in the bunker in the latter stages of the battle. [17]\nThe decision to surrender Singapore was made by Lieutenant-General Percival in a meeting on the morning of 15 February 1942. Held in the 'Commander, Anti-Aircraft Defence Room' of the bunker, [18] a number of senior officers were in attendance, including Generals Bennett , Heath and Simmons. With diminishing water supplies, and no viable options for launching a counterattack, the decision was made to seek terms with the Japanese. [19]\nThe Fort Canning Bunker was later occupied by Japanese forces during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore and used for communications right up to the time of the Japanese surrender. [20] At the conclusion of the Second World War, the bunker complex itself appears to have been looted in the aftermath of the Japanese surrender. Upon re-entry to the complex in 1988, evidence of a number of excavations were observed, presumably attempts to find loot that may have been concealed by the Japanese. [21]\nThe Battle Box ticketing office, Fort Canning Hill\nAfter the war, Fort Canning Hill was again used by the British as the Singapore Base District Headquarters. The British handed over Fort Canning to the Singapore Armed Forces in 1968\u201369, and the buildings of Fort Canning Hill served for a time as the Singapore Command and Staff College . The Fort Canning Bunker, having remained empty and unused since the war, was sealed off in the late 1960s due to safety concerns [22] and its exact location forgotten. It was brought back into the public eye when it was \"rediscovered\" by a journalist in 1988, who was following a number of leads claiming the existence of an underground bunker complex on Fort Canning Hill. [23]\nThe Fort Canning Bunker was developed into a museum depicting the final days of the Battle of Singapore. The museum, called the Battle Box, was formally opened on 15 February 1997, on the 55th anniversary of the surrender of Singapore.

            "The Indian Heritage Centre, under the management of the National Heritage Board and with support from the Indian community, traces the history of the Indian and South Asian communities in the Southeast Asian region.\nThe four-storey building is an iconic, unique and sustainable building that blends both traditional Indian as well as modern architectural elements. The architectural design for the facade is inspired by the baoli (or Indian stepwell), and seeks to create an urban forum for the celebration and appreciation of Indian culture. It houses five permanent galleries, a museum shop as well as programming and activity spaces.\nThe diversity and multi-faceted nature of Indian culture is also captured in the use of a translucent shimmering fa\u00e7ade to create an impression of the Centre as a \u201cshining jewel\u201d in the day, and the transformation into a \u201cglowing lantern\u201d of the Indian community with the lighting of the colourful fa\u00e7ade mural at night.\nSituated at 5 Campbell Lane, the Centre also serves as a springboard for visitors to explore Little India and enjoy the sights, sounds and scents of the historical precinct. Indian Heritage Centre was opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 7 May 2015 and offers year-round exhibitions, programmes and activities to promote greater public awareness and appreciation of Indian heritage, arts and culture.\nShare this\nSTAY UPDATED\nJoin our mailing list today and be updated on the latest events and exhibitions!\nTel: (+65) 6291 1601\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Indian Heritage Centre.

            "Five things to know about the new Indian Heritage Centre\nAn issue of The Orient Weekly from January 1946 is among several war-time publications donated by Singapore\u2019s sixth president, Mr S R Nathan. \u00a0-- PHOTO: ST FILE\nThe Indian Heritage Centre, the first museum dedicated to the South Asian community. -- ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\nThis intricate gold necklace circa early 20th century which originates from Kerala, South India, is on display at the Indian Heritage Centre. -- ST PHOTO: TIFFANY GOH\nThe Indian Heritage Centre, the first museum dedicated to the South Asian community. -- ST PHOTO: TIFFANY GOH\nSouth and South-east Indian sculptures at the Indian Heritage Centre. -- ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI\nPublished\nSINGAPORE - The new $21-million Indian Heritage Centre at 5 Campbell Lane in Little India opens its doors on Friday after an official launch by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday evening.\nTo mark its opening, a CultureFest has been launched and it will stretch to May 31. Activities such as street fairs, performances and outdoor film screenings will spill out onto the newly pedestrianised lane.\nHere are some facts about the museum, which is the first in South-east Asia dedicated to the Indian community's diverse heritage.\n1. Its genesis\nFirst mooted in 2008, the 3,090 sq m, four-storey centre is a culmination of about seven years of work. It was endorsed by the late founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew and was first helmed by the late Dr Balaji Sadasivan, the senior minister of state. Mr S. Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, took over Dr Balaji's role as the chairman of the centre's steering committee after he died in 2010.\n2. Its storyline\nDivided into five themes, the museum starts with the early interactions between South Asia and South-east Asia. It goes on to feature the origins and movement of Indians from the 19th century to the 21st century.\nThe third section features the contributions of early Indian pioneers in Singapore and Malaya, while the fourth showcases the social and political awakening of Indians here. The busts of four Indian nationalist leaders including Mahatma Gandhi, on loan from the Government of India, are on display in this fourth section.\nThe final section showcases the contributions of Indians in Singapore from the late 1950s to the 1980s.\n3. Its artefacts\nIt is home to more than 440 artefacts, some of which have been acquired, donated or are on loan.\nThere are jewellery, stone sculptures, costumes, wood carvings and vintage suitcases that were used by Indian immigrants. Other interesting artefacts include a 3.4m-tall wooden Chettinad doorway from the late 19th century with 5,000 minute carvings. It reflects the bespoke architectural style of South India's Chettiar community, which had acquired wealth from their moneylending businesses across South-east Asia.\nSingapore's sixth president, Mr S R Nathan, also donated a series of war-time publications from the 1940s which provide rare proof of the involvement of the region's Indian community in the Indian National Army. Back then, the army was fighting for independence from Britain.\n4. Its pioneers\nThe museum also pays tribute to Indian pioneers such as South Indian businessman Mr P. Govindasamy Pillai who came to Singapore in the early 1900s. He worked at a provision store on 50 Serangoon Road where he was only given food and lodging instead of wages. When the provision store owner died, he borrowed S$2,000 from the Chettiars or Indian moneylenders and started his own business. He eventually established a chain of PGP department stores.\nThere are others such as Parsi pioneer Navroji Mistri. Arriving on Singapore's shores in 1912, he made his fortune selling soda water. He donated $1 million in 1952, a princely sum for that time, to build a paediatric wing at the Singapore General Hospital.\n5. Its technology\nIt is one of the first museums here to use augmented reality in its permanent galleries. Visitors can use their mobile phones or the centre's hand-held devices to listen to a virual guide who will share with them more information on the centre's artefacts.\nThe museum also features role-playing games and interactive touch screens.\nTopics:\nThe Straits Times\nWe have been experiencing some problems with subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused.
